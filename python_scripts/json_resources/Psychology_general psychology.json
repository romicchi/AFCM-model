Chapter 1: The Origins of Psychology 1\nHistory of Psychology\nDavid B. Baker & Heather Sperry\nThis module provides an introduction and overview of the historical development of the\nscience and practice of psychology in America. Ever-increasing specialization within the field\noften makes it difficult to discern the common roots from which the field of psychology has\nevolved. By exploring this shared past, students will be better able to understand how\npsychology has developed into the discipline we know today.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Describe the precursors to the establishment of the science of psychology.\n\u2022 Identify key individuals and events in the history of American psychology.\n\u2022 Describe the rise of professional psychology in America.\n\u2022 Develop a basic understanding of the processes of scientific development and change.\n\u2022 Recognize the role of women and people of color in the history of American psychology.\nIntroduction\nIt is always a difficult question to ask, where to begin to tell the story of the history of\npsychology. Some would start with ancient Greece; others would look to a demarcation in the\nlate 19th century when the science of psychology was formally proposed and instituted. These\ntwo perspectives, and all that is in between, are appropriate for describing a history of\npsychology. The interested student will have no trouble finding an abundance of resources\non all of these time frames and perspectives (Goodwin, 2011; Leahey, 2012; Schultz & Schultz, History of Psychology 6\n2007). For the purposes of this module, we will examine\nthe development of psychology in America and use the\nmid-19th century as our starting point. For the sake of\nconvenience, we refer to this as a history of modern\npsychology.\nPsychology is an exciting field and the history of\npsychology offers the opportunity to make sense of how\nit has grown and developed. The history of psychology\nalso provides perspective. Rather than a dry collection\nof names and dates, the history of psychology tells us\nabout the important intersection of time and place that\ndefines who we are. Consider what happens when you\nmeet someone for the first time. The conversation\nusually begins with a series of questions such as, \u201cWhere\nThe earliest records of a psychological\ndid you grow up?\u201d \u201cHow long have you lived here?\u201d\nexperiment go all the way back to the Pharaoh\nPsamtik I of Egypt in the 7th Century B.C. \u201cWhere did you go to school?\u201d The importance of history\n[Image: Neithsabes] in defining who we are cannot be understated. Whether\nyou are seeing a physician, talking with a counselor, or\napplying for a job, everything begins with a history. The same is true for studying the history\nof psychology; getting a history of the field helps to make sense of where we are and how we\ngot here.\nA Prehistory of Psychology\nPrecursors to American psychology can be found in philosophy and physiology. Philosophers\nsuch as John Locke (1632\u20131704) and Thomas Reid (1710\u20131796) promoted empiricism, the\nidea that all knowledge comes from experience. The work of Locke, Reid, and others\nemphasized the role of the human observer and the primacy of the senses in defining how\nthe mind comes to acquire knowledge. In American colleges and universities in the early\n1800s, these principles were taught as courses on mental and moral philosophy. Most often\nthese courses taught about the mind based on the faculties of intellect, will, and the senses\n(Fuchs, 2000).\nPhysiology and Psychophysics\nPhilosophical questions about the nature of mind and knowledge were matched in the 19th\ncentury by physiological investigations of the sensory systems of the human observer. German History of Psychology 7\nphysiologist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894) measured the speed of the neural impulse\nand explored the physiology of hearing and vision. His work indicated that our senses can\ndeceive us and are not a mirror of the external world. Such work showed that even though\nthe human senses were fallible, the mind could be measured using the methods of science.\nIn all, it suggested that a science of psychology was feasible.\nAn important implication of Helmholtz\u2019s work was that there is a psychological reality and a\nphysical reality and that the two are not identical. This was not a new idea; philosophers like\nJohn Locke had written extensively on the topic, and in the 19th century, philosophical\nspeculation about the nature of mind became subject to the rigors of science.\nThe question of the relationship between the mental (experiences of the senses) and the\nmaterial (external reality) was investigated by a number of German researchers including\nErnst Weber and Gustav Fechner. Their work was called psychophysics, and it introduced\nmethods for measuring the relationship between physical stimuli and human perception that\nwould serve as the basis for the new science of psychology (Fancher & Rutherford, 2011).\nThe formal development of modern psychology is usually credited to the work of German\nphysician, physiologist, and philosopher Wilhelm Wundt (1832\u20131920). Wundt helped to\nestablish the field of experimental psychology by serving as a strong promoter of the idea\nthat psychology could be an experimental field and by providing classes, textbooks, and a\nlaboratory for training students. In 1875, he joined the faculty at the University of Leipzig and\nquickly began to make plans for the creation of a program of experimental psychology. In\n1879, he complemented his lectures on experimental psychology with a laboratory\nexperience: an event that has served as the popular date for the establishment of the science\nof psychology.\nThe response to the new science was immediate and global. Wundt attracted students from\naround the world to study the new experimental psychology and work in his lab. Students\nwere trained to offer detailed self-reports of their reactions to various stimuli, a procedure\nknown as introspection. The goal was to identify the elements of consciousness. In addition\nto the study of sensation and perception, research was done on mental chronometry, more\ncommonly known as reaction time. The work of Wundt and his students demonstrated that\nthe mind could be measured and the nature of consciousness could be revealed through\nscientific means. It was an exciting proposition, and one that found great interest in America.\nAfter the opening of Wundt\u2019s lab in 1879, it took just four years for the first psychology\nlaboratory to open in the United States (Benjamin, 2007).\nScientific Psychology Comes to the United States History of Psychology 8\nWundt\u2019s version of psychology arrived in America most visibly through the work of Edward\nBradford Titchener (1867\u20131927). A student of Wundt\u2019s, Titchener brought to America a brand\nof experimental psychology referred to as \u201cstructuralism.\u201d Structuralists were interested in\nthe contents of the mind\u2014what the mind is. For Titchener, the general adult mind was the\nproper focus for the new psychology, and he excluded from study those with mental\ndeficiencies, children, and animals (Evans, 1972; Titchener, 1909).\nExperimental psychology spread rather rapidly throughout North America. By 1900, there\nwere more than 40 laboratories in the United States and Canada (Benjamin, 2000). Psychology\nin America also organized early with the establishment of the American Psychological\nAssociation (APA) in 1892. Titchener felt that this new organization did not adequately\nrepresent the interests of experimental psychology, so, in 1904, he organized a group of\ncolleagues to create what is now known as the Society of Experimental Psychologists (Goodwin,\n1985). The group met annually to discuss research in experimental psychology. Reflecting the\ntimes, women researchers were not invited (or welcome). It is interesting to note that\nTitchener\u2019s first doctoral student was a woman, Margaret Floy Washburn (1871\u20131939). Despite\nmany barriers, in 1894, Washburn became the first woman in America to earn a Ph.D. in\npsychology and, in 1921, only the second woman to be elected president of the American\nPsychological Association (Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987).\nStriking a balance between the science and practice of psychology continues to this day. In\n1988, the American Psychological Society (now known as the Association for Psychological\nScience) was founded with the central mission of advancing psychological science.\nToward a Functional Psychology\nWhile Titchener and his followers adhered to a structural psychology, others in America were\npursuing different approaches. William James, G. Stanley Hall, and James McKeen Cattell were\namong a group that became identified with \u201cfunctionalism.\u201d Influenced by Darwin\u2019s\nevolutionary theory, functionalists were interested in the activities of the mind\u2014what the\nmind does. An interest in functionalism opened the way for the study of a wide range of\napproaches, including animal and comparative psychology (Benjamin, 2007).\nWilliam James (1842\u20131910) is regarded as writing perhaps the most influential and important\nbook in the field of psychology, Principles of Psychology, published in 1890. Opposed to the\nreductionist ideas of Titchener, James proposed that consciousness is ongoing and\ncontinuous; it cannot be isolated and reduced to elements. For James, consciousness helped\nus adapt to our environment in such ways as allowing us to make choices and have personal History of Psychology 9\nresponsibility over those choices.\nAt Harvard, James occupied a position of authority and respect in psychology and philosophy.\nThrough his teaching and writing, he influenced psychology for generations. One of his\nstudents, Mary Whiton Calkins (1863\u20131930), faced many of the challenges that confronted\nMargaret Floy Washburn and other women interested in pursuing graduate education in\npsychology. With much persistence, Calkins was able to study with James at Harvard. She\neventually completed all the requirements for the doctoral degree, but Harvard refused to\ngrant her a diploma because she was a woman. Despite these challenges, Calkins went on to\nbecome an accomplished researcher and the first woman elected president of the American\nPsychological Association in 1905 (Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987).\nG. Stanley Hall (1844\u20131924) made substantial and lasting contributions to the establishment\nof psychology in the United States. At Johns Hopkins University, he founded the first\npsychological laboratory in America in 1883. In 1887, he created the first journal of psychology\nin America, American Journal of Psychology. In 1892, he founded the American Psychological\nAssociation (APA); in 1909, he invited and hosted Freud at Clark University (the only time Freud\nvisited America). Influenced by evolutionary theory, Hall was interested in the process of\nadaptation and human development. Using surveys and questionnaires to study children,\nHall wrote extensively on child development and education. While graduate education in\npsychology was restricted for women in Hall\u2019s time, it was all but non-existent for African\nAmericans. In another first, Hall mentored Francis Cecil Sumner (1895\u20131954) who, in 1920,\nbecame the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in psychology in America (Guthrie, 2003).\nJames McKeen Cattell (1860\u20131944) received his Ph.D. with Wundt but quickly turned his\ninterests to the assessment of individual differences. Influenced by the work of Darwin\u2019s\ncousin, Frances Galton, Cattell believed that mental abilities such as intelligence were inherited\nand could be measured using mental tests. Like Galton, he believed society was better served\nby identifying those with superior intelligence and supported efforts to encourage them to\nreproduce. Such beliefs were associated with eugenics (the promotion of selective breeding)\nand fueled early debates about the contributions of heredity and environment in defining\nwho we are. At Columbia University, Cattell developed a department of psychology that\nbecame world famous also promoting psychological science through advocacy and as a\npublisher of scientific journals and reference works (Fancher, 1987; Sokal, 1980).\nThe Growth of Psychology\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century, psychology continued to grow and flourish in History of Psychology 10\nAmerica. It was large enough to accommodate varying points of view on the nature of mind\nand behavior. Gestalt psychology is a good example. The Gestalt movement began in\nGermany with the work of Max Wertheimer (1880\u20131943). Opposed to the reductionist\napproach of Wundt\u2019s laboratory psychology, Wertheimer and his colleagues Kurt Koffka (1886\u2013\n1941), Wolfgang Kohler (1887\u20131967), and Kurt Lewin (1890\u20131947) believed that studying the\nwhole of any experience was richer than studying individual aspects of that experience. The\nsaying \u201cthe whole is greater than the sum of its parts\u201d is a Gestalt perspective. Consider that\na melody is an additional element beyond the collection of notes that comprise it. The Gestalt\npsychologists proposed that the mind often processes information simultaneously rather\nthan sequentially. For instance, when you look at a photograph, you see a whole image, not\njust a collection of pixels of color. Using Gestalt principles, Wertheimer and his colleagues\nalso explored the nature of learning and thinking. Most of the German Gestalt psychologists\nwere Jewish and were forced to flee the Nazi regime due to the threats posed on both academic\nand personal freedoms. In America, they were able to introduce a new audience to the Gestalt\nperspective, demonstrating how it could be applied to perception and learning (Wertheimer,\n1938). In many ways, the work of the Gestalt psychologists served as a precursor to the rise\nof cognitive psychology in America (Benjamin, 2007).\nBehaviorism emerged early in the 20th century and became a major force in American\npsychology. Championed by psychologists such as John B. Watson (1878\u20131958) and B. F.\nSkinner (1904\u20131990), behaviorism rejected any reference to mind and viewed overt and\nobservable behavior as the proper subject matter of psychology. Through the scientific study\nof behavior, it was hoped that laws of learning could be derived that would promote the\nprediction and control of behavior. Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849\u20131936) influenced\nearly behaviorism in America. His work on conditioned learning, popularly referred to as\nclassical conditioning, provided support for the notion that learning and behavior were\ncontrolled by events in the environment and could be explained with no reference to mind\nor consciousness (Fancher, 1987).\nFor decades, behaviorism dominated American psychology. By the 1960s, psychologists began\nto recognize that behaviorism was unable to fully explain human behavior because it neglected\nmental processes. The turn toward a cognitive psychology was not new. In the 1930s, British\npsychologist Frederic C. Bartlett (1886\u20131969) explored the idea of the constructive mind,\nrecognizing that people use their past experiences to construct frameworks in which to\nunderstand new experiences. Some of the major pioneers in American cognitive psychology\ninclude Jerome Bruner (1915\u2013), Roger Brown (1925\u20131997), and George Miller (1920\u20132012). In\nthe 1950s, Bruner conducted pioneering studies on cognitive aspects of sensation and\nperception. Brown conducted original research on language and memory, coined the term\n\u201cflashbulb memory,\u201d and figured out how to study the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon History of Psychology 11\n(Benjamin, 2007). Miller\u2019s research on working memory is legendary. His 1956 paper \u201cThe\nMagic Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing\nInformation\u201dis one of the most highly cited papers in psychology. A popular interpretation of\nMiller\u2019s research was that the number of bits of information an average human can hold in\nworking memory is 7 \u00b1 2. Around the same time, the study of computer science was growing\nand was used as an analogy to explore and understand how the mind works. The work of\nMiller and others in the 1950s and 1960s has inspired tremendous interest in cognition and\nneuroscience, both of which dominate much of contemporary American psychology.\nApplied Psychology in America\nIn America, there has always been an interest in the application of psychology to everyday\nlife. Mental testing is an important example. Modern intelligence tests were developed by the\nFrench psychologist Alfred Binet (1857\u20131911). His goal was to develop a test that would identify\nschoolchildren in need of educational support. His test, which included tasks of reasoning\nand problem solving, was introduced in the United States by Henry Goddard (1866\u20131957) and\nlater standardized by Lewis Terman (1877\u20131956) at Stanford University. The assessment and\nmeaning of intelligence has fueled debates in American psychology and society for nearly 100\nyears. Much of this is captured in the nature-nurture debate that raises questions about the\nrelative contributions of heredity and environment in determining intelligence (Fancher, 1987).\nApplied psychology was not limited to mental testing. What psychologists were learning in\ntheir laboratories was applied in many settings including the military, business, industry, and\neducation. The early 20th century was witness to rapid advances in applied psychology. Hugo\nMunsterberg (1863\u20131916) of Harvard University made contributions to such areas as\nemployee selection, eyewitness testimony, and psychotherapy. Walter D. Scott (1869\u20131955)\nand Harry Hollingworth (1880\u20131956) produced original work on the psychology of advertising\nand marketing. Lillian Gilbreth (1878\u20131972) was a pioneer in industrial psychology and\nengineering psychology. Working with her husband, Frank, they promoted the use of time\nand motion studies to improve efficiency in industry. Lillian also brought the efficiency\nmovement to the home, designing kitchens and appliances including the pop-up trashcan\nand refrigerator door shelving. Their psychology of efficiency also found plenty of applications\nat home with their 12 children. The experience served as the inspiration for the movie Cheaper\nby the Dozen (Benjamin, 2007).\nClinical psychology was also an early application of experimental psychology in America.\nLightner Witmer (1867\u20131956) received his Ph.D. in experimental psychology with Wilhelm\nWundt and returned to the University of Pennsylvania, where he opened a psychological clinic History of Psychology 12\nin 1896. Witmer believed that because psychology dealt with the study of sensation and\nperception, it should be of value in treating children with learning and behavioral problems.\nHe is credited as the founder of both clinical and school psychology (Benjamin & Baker, 2004).\nPsychology as a Profession\nAs the roles of psychologists and the needs of the public continued to change, it was necessary\nfor psychology to begin to define itself as a profession. Without standards for training and\npractice, anyone could use the title psychologist and offer services to the public. As early as\n1917, applied psychologists organized to create standards for education, training, and\nlicensure. By the 1930s, these efforts led to the creation of the American Association for\nApplied Psychology (AAAP). While the American Psychological Association (APA) represented\nthe interests of academic psychologists, AAAP served those in education, industry, consulting,\nand clinical work.\nThe advent of WWII changed everything. The psychiatric casualties of war were staggering,\nand there were simply not enough mental health professionals to meet the need. Recognizing\nthe shortage, the federal government urged the AAAP and APA to work together to meet the\nmental health needs of the nation. The result was the merging of the AAAP and the APA and\na focus on the training of professional psychologists. Through the provisions of National\nMental Health Act of 1946, funding was made available that allowed the APA, the Veterans\nAdministration, and the Public Health Service to work together to develop training programs\nthat would produce clinical psychologists. These efforts led to the convening of the Boulder\nConference on Graduate Education in Clinical Psychology in 1949 in Boulder, Colorado. The\nmeeting launched doctoral training in psychology and gave us the scientist-practitioner\nmodel of training. Similar meetings also helped launch doctoral training programs in\ncounseling and school psychology. Throughout the second half of the 20th century,\nalternatives to Boulder have been debated. In 1973, the Vail Conference on Professional\nTraining in Psychology proposed the scholar-practitioner model and the Psy.D. degree\n(Doctor of Psychology). It is a training model that emphasizes clinical training and practice\nthat has become more common (Cautin & Baker, in press).\nPsychology and Society\nGiven that psychology deals with the human condition, it is not surprising that psychologists\nwould involve themselves in social issues. For more than a century, psychology and\npsychologists have been agents of social action and change. Using the methods and tools of\nscience, psychologists have challenged assumptions, stereotypes, and stigma. Founded in History of Psychology 13\n1936, the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI) has supported research\nand action on a wide range of social issues. Individually, there have been many psychologists\nwhose efforts have promoted social change. Helen Thompson Woolley (1874\u20131947) and Leta\nS. Hollingworth (1886\u20131939) were pioneers in research on the psychology of sex differences.\nWorking in the early 20th century, when women\u2019s rights were marginalized, Thompson\nexamined the assumption that women were overemotional compared to men and found that\nemotion did not influence women\u2019s decisions any more than it did men\u2019s. Hollingworth found\nthat menstruation did not negatively impact women\u2019s cognitive or motor abilities. Such work\ncombatted harmful stereotypes and showed that psychological research could contribute to\nsocial change (Scarborough & Furumoto, 1987).\nAmong the first generation of African American psychologists, Mamie Phipps Clark (1917\u2013\n1983) and her husband Kenneth Clark (1914\u20132005) studied the psychology of race and\ndemonstrated the ways in which school segregation negatively impacted the self-esteem of\nAfrican American children. Their research was influential in the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in\nthe case of Brown v. Board of Education, which ended school segregation (Guthrie, 2003). In\npsychology, greater advocacy for issues impacting the African American community were\nadvanced by the creation of the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi) in 1968.\nIn 1957, psychologist Evelyn Hooker (1907\u20131996) published the paper \u201cThe Adjustment of the\nMale Overt Homosexual,\u201d reporting on her research that showed no significant differences in\npsychological adjustment between homosexual and heterosexual men. Her research helped\nto de-pathologize homosexuality and contributed to the decision by the American Psychiatric\nAssociation to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders in 1973 (Garnets & Kimmel, 2003).\nConclusion\nGrowth and expansion have been a constant in American psychology. In the latter part of the\n20th century, areas such as social, developmental, and personality psychology made major\ncontributions to our understanding of what it means to be human. Today neuroscience is\nenjoying tremendous interest and growth.\nAs mentioned at the beginning of the module, it is a challenge to cover all the history of\npsychology in such a short space. Errors of omission and commission are likely in such a\nselective review. The history of psychology helps to set a stage upon which the story of\npsychology can be told.

Chapter 2: The Methods of Psychology 2\nResearch Designs\nChristie Napa Scollon\nPsychologists test research questions using a variety of methods. Most research relies on\neither correlations or experiments. With correlations, researchers measure variables as they\nnaturally occur in people and compute the degree to which two variables go together. With\nexperiments, researchers actively make changes in one variable and watch for changes in\nanother variable. Experiments allow researchers to make causal inferences. Other types of\nmethods include longitudinal and quasi-experimental designs. Many factors, including\npractical constraints, determine the type of methods researchers use. Often researchers\nsurvey people even though it would be better, but more expensive and time consuming, to\ntrack them longitudinally.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Understand the difference between correlational and experimental designs.\n\u2022 Understand how to interpret correlations.\n\u2022 Understand how experiments help us to infer causality.\n\u2022 Understand how surveys relate to correlational and experimental research.\n\u2022 Understand what a longitudinal study is.\n\u2022 Understand the strengths and weaknesses of different research designs.\nResearch Designs Research Designs 23\nIn the early 1970\u2019s, a man named Uri Geller tricked the world: he convinced hundreds of\nthousands of people that he could bend spoons and slow watches using only the power of\nhis mind. In fact, if you were in the audience, you would have likely believed he had psychic\npowers. Everything looked authentic\u2014this man had to have paranormal abilities! So, why\nhave you probably never heard of him before? Because when Uri was asked to perform his\nmiracles in line with scientific experimentation, he was no longer able to do them. That is,\neven though it seemed like he was doing the impossible, when he was tested by science, he\nproved to be nothing more than a clever magician.\nWhen we look at dinosaur bones to make educated guesses about extinct life, or systematically\nchart the heavens to learn about the relationships between stars and planets, or study\nmagicians to figure out how they perform their tricks, we are forming observations\u2014the\nfoundation of science. Although we are all familiar with the saying \u201cseeing is believing,\u201d\nconducting science is more than just what your eyes perceive. Science is the result of\nsystematic and intentional study of the natural world. And psychology is no different. In the\nmovie Jerry Maguire, Cuba Gooding, Jr. became famous for using the phrase, \u201cShow me the\nmoney!\u201d In psychology, as in all sciences, we might say, \u201cShow me the data!\u201d\nOne of the important steps in scientific inquiry is to test our research questions, otherwise\nknown as hypotheses. However, there are many ways to test hypotheses in psychological\nresearch. Which method you choose will depend on the type of questions you are asking, as\nwell as what resources are available to you. All methods have limitations, which is why the\nbest research uses a variety of methods.\nMost psychological research can be divided into two types: experimental and correlational\nresearch.\nExperimental Research\nIf somebody gave you $20 that absolutely had to be spent today, how would you choose to\nspend it? Would you spend it on an item you\u2019ve been eyeing for weeks, or would you donate\nthe money to charity? Which option do you think would bring you the most happiness? If\nyou\u2019re like most people, you\u2019d choose to spend the money on yourself (duh, right?). Our\nintuition is that we\u2019d be happier if we spent the money on ourselves.\nKnowing that our intuition can sometimes be wrong, Professor Elizabeth Dunn (2008) at the\nUniversity of British Columbia set out to conduct an experiment on spending and happiness.\nShe gave each of the participants in her experiment $20 and then told them they had to spend Research Designs 24\nthe money by the end of the day.\nSome of the participants were told\nthey must spend the money on\nthemselves, and some were told they\nmust spend the money on others\n(either charity or a gift for someone).\nAt the end of the day she measured\nparticipants\u2019 levels of happiness\nusing a self-report questionnaire.\n(But wait, how do you measure\nsomething like happiness when you\nAt the Corner Perk Cafe customers routinely pay for the drinks of can\u2019t really see it? Psychologists\nstrangers. Is this the way to get the most happiness out of a cup of coffee?\nmeasure many abstract concepts,\nElizabeth Dunn's research shows that spending money on others may\nsuch as happiness and intelligence,\naffect our happiness differently than spending money on ourselves.\nby beginning with operational\ndefinitions of the concepts. See the Noba modules on Intelligence [http://noba.to/acxb2thy] and\nHappiness [http://noba.to/qnw7g32t], respectively, for more information on specific\nmeasurement strategies.)\nIn an experiment, researchers manipulate, or cause changes, in the independent variable,\nand observe or measure any impact of those changes in the dependent variable. The\nindependent variable is the one under the experimenter\u2019s control, or the variable that is\nintentionally altered between groups. In the case of Dunn\u2019s experiment, the independent\nvariable was whether participants spent the money on themselves or on others. The\ndependent variable is the variable that is not manipulated at all, or the one where the effect\nhappens. One way to help remember this is that the dependent variable \u201cdepends\u201d on what\nhappens to the independent variable. In our example, the participants\u2019 happiness (the\ndependent variable in this experiment) depends on how the participants spend their money\n(the independent variable). Thus, any observed changes or group differences in happiness\ncan be attributed to whom the money was spent on. What Dunn and her colleagues found\nwas that, after all the spending had been done, the people who had spent the money on\nothers were happier than those who had spent the money on themselves. In other words,\nspending on others causes us to be happier than spending on ourselves. Do you find this\nsurprising?\nBut wait! Doesn\u2019t happiness depend on a lot of different factors\u2014for instance, a person\u2019s\nupbringing or life circumstances? What if some people had happy childhoods and that\u2019s why\nthey\u2019re happier? Or what if some people dropped their toast that morning and it fell jam-side\ndown and ruined their whole day? It is correct to recognize that these factors and many more Research Designs 25\ncan easily affect a person\u2019s level of happiness. So how can we accurately conclude that\nspending money on others causes happiness, as in the case of Dunn\u2019s experiment?\nThe most important thing about experiments is random assignment. Participants don\u2019t get\nto pick which condition they are in (e.g., participants didn\u2019t choose whether they were\nsupposed to spend the money on themselves versus others). The experimenter assigns them\nto a particular condition based on the flip of a coin or the roll of a die or any other random\nmethod. Why do researchers do this? With Dunn\u2019s study, there is the obvious reason: you can\nimagine which condition most people would choose to be in, if given the choice. But another\nequally important reason is that random assignment makes it so the groups, on average, are\nsimilar on all characteristics except what the experimenter manipulates.\nBy randomly assigning people to conditions (self-spending versus other-spending), some\npeople with happy childhoods should end up in each condition. Likewise, some people who\nhad dropped their toast that morning (or experienced some other disappointment) should\nend up in each condition. As a result, the distribution of all these factors will generally be\nconsistent across the two groups, and this means that on average the two groups will be\nrelatively equivalent on all these factors. Random assignment is critical to experimentation\nbecause if the only difference between the two groups is the independent variable, we can\ninfer that the independent variable is the cause of any observable difference (e.g., in the\namount of happiness they feel at the end of the day).\nHere\u2019s another example of the importance of random assignment: Let\u2019s say your class is going\nto form two basketball teams, and you get to be the captain of one team. The class is to be\ndivided evenly between the two teams. If you get to pick the players for your team first, whom\nwill you pick? You\u2019ll probably pick the tallest members of the class or the most athletic. You\nprobably won\u2019t pick the short, uncoordinated people, unless there are no other options. As a\nresult, your team will be taller and more athletic than the other team. But what if we want the\nteams to be fair? How can we do this when we have people of varying height and ability? All\nwe have to do is randomly assign players to the two teams. Most likely, some tall and some\nshort people will end up on your team, and some tall and some short people will end up on\nthe other team. The average height of the teams will be approximately the same. That is the\npower of random assignment!\nOther considerations\nIn addition to using random assignment, you should avoid introducing confounds into your\nexperiments. Confounds are things that could undermine your ability to draw causal Research Designs 26\ninferences. For example, if you wanted to test if a new happy pill will make people happier,\nyou could randomly assign participants to take the happy pill or not (the independent variable)\nand compare these two groups on their self-reported happiness (the dependent variable).\nHowever, if some participants know they are getting the happy pill, they might develop\nexpectations that influence their self-reported happiness. This is sometimes known as a\nplacebo effect. Sometimes a person just knowing that he or she is receiving special treatment\nor something new is enough to actually cause changes in behavior or perception: In other\nwords, even if the participants in the happy pill condition were to report being happier, we\nwouldn\u2019t know if the pill was actually making them happier or if it was the placebo effect\u2014an\nexample of a confound. A related idea is participant demand. This occurs when participants\ntry to behave in a way they think the experimenter wants them to behave. Placebo effects\nand participant demand often occur unintentionally. Even experimenter expectations can\ninfluence the outcome of a study. For example, if the experimenter knows who took the happy\npill and who did not, and the dependent variable is the experimenter\u2019s observations of people\u2019s\nhappiness, then the experimenter might perceive improvements in the happy pill group that\nare not really there.\nOne way to prevent these confounds from affecting the results of a study is to use a double-\nblind procedure. In a double-blind procedure, neither the participant nor the experimenter\nknows which condition the participant is in. For example, when participants are given the\nhappy pill or the fake pill, they don\u2019t know which one they are receiving. This way the\nparticipants shouldn\u2019t experience the placebo effect, and will be unable to behave as the\nresearcher expects (participant demand). Likewise, the researcher doesn\u2019t know which pill\neach participant is taking (at least in the beginning\u2014later, the researcher will get the results\nfor data-analysis purposes), which means the researcher\u2019s expectations can\u2019t influence his or\nher observations. Therefore, because both parties are \u201cblind\u201d to the condition, neither will be\nable to behave in a way that introduces a confound. At the end of the day, the only difference\nbetween groups will be which pills the participants received, allowing the researcher to\ndetermine if the happy pill actually caused people to be happier.\nCorrelational Designs\nWhen scientists passively observe and measure phenomena it is called correlational research.\nHere, we do not intervene and change behavior, as we do in experiments. In correlational\nresearch, we identify patterns of relationships, but we usually cannot infer what causes what.\nImportantly, with correlational research, you can examine only two variables at a time, no\nmore and no less. Research Designs 27\nSo, what if you wanted to test whether spending on others is related to happiness, but you\ndon\u2019t have $20 to give to each participant? You could use a correlational design\u2014which is\nexactly what Professor Dunn did, too. She asked people how much of their income they spent\non others or donated to charity, and later she asked them how happy they were. Do you think\nthese two variables were related? Yes, they were! The more money people reported spending\non others, the happier they were.\nMore details about the correlation\nTo find out how well two variables correspond, we can plot the relation between the two\nscores on what is known as a scatterplot (Figure 1). In the scatterplot, each dot represents a\ndata point. (In this case it\u2019s individuals, but it could be some other unit.) Importantly, each dot\nprovides us with two pieces of information\u2014in this case, information about how good the\nperson rated the past month (x-axis) and how happy the person felt in the past month (y-\naxis). Which variable is plotted on which axis does not matter.\nThe association between two variables\ncan be summarized statistically using the\ncorrelation coefficient (abbreviated as r).\nA correlation coefficient provides information\nabout the direction and strength of the\nassociation between two variables. For\nthe example above, the direction of the\nassociation is positive. This means that\npeople who perceived the past month as\nbeing good reported feeling more happy,\nwhereas people who perceived the\nmonth as being bad reported feeling less\nhappy.\nWith a positive correlation, the two\nFigure 1. Scatterplot of the association between happiness and variables go up or down together. In a\nratings of the past month, a positive correlation (r = .81). Each dot scatterplot, the dots form a pattern that\nrepresents an individual. extends from the bottom left to the upper\nright (just as they do in Figure 1). The r\nvalue for a positive correlation is indicated by a positive number (although, the positive sign\nis usually omitted). Here, the r value is .81. Research Designs 28\nA negative correlation is one in which the two variables move in opposite directions. That is,\nas one variable goes up, the other goes down. Figure 2 shows the association between the\naverage height of males in a country (y-axis) and the pathogen prevalence (or commonness\nof disease; x-axis) of that country. In this scatterplot, each dot represents a country. Notice\nhow the dots extend from the top left to the bottom right. What does this mean in real-world\nterms? It means that people are shorter in parts of the world where there is more disease.\nThe r value for a negative correlation is indicated by a negative number\u2014that is, it has a minus\n(\u2013) sign in front of it. Here, it is \u2013.83.\nThe strength of a correlation has to\ndo with how well the two variables\nalign. Recall that in Professor Dunn\u2019s\ncorrelational study, spending on\nothers positively correlated with\nhappiness: The more money people\nreported spending on others, the\nhappier they reported to be. At this\npoint you may be thinking to\nyourself, I know a very generous\nperson who gave away lots of\nmoney to other people but is\nmiserable! Or maybe you know of a\nvery stingy person who is happy as\ncan be. Yes, there might be\nFigure 2. Scatterplot showing the association between average male\nexceptions. If an association has\nheight and pathogen prevalence, a negative correlation (r = \u2013.83). Each\nmany exceptions, it is considered a\ndot represents a country. (Chiao, 2009)\nweak correlation. If an association\nhas few or no exceptions, it is considered a strong correlation. A strong correlation is one in\nwhich the two variables always, or almost always, go together. In the example of happiness\nand how good the month has been, the association is strong. The stronger a correlation is,\nthe tighter the dots in the scatterplot will be arranged along a sloped line.\nThe r value of a strong correlation will have a high absolute value. In other words, you disregard\nwhether there is a negative sign in front of the r value, and just consider the size of the\nnumerical value itself. If the absolute value is large, it is a strong correlation. A weak correlation\nis one in which the two variables correspond some of the time, but not most of the time.\nFigure 3 shows the relation between valuing happiness and grade point average (GPA). People\nwho valued happiness more tended to earn slightly lower grades, but there were lots of\nexceptions to this. The r value for a weak correlation will have a low absolute value. If two Research Designs 29\nvariables are so weakly related as to be unrelated, we say they are uncorrelated, and the r\nvalue will be zero or very close to zero. In the previous example, is the correlation between\nheight and pathogen prevalence strong? Compared to Figure 3, the dots in Figure 2 are tighter\nand less dispersed. The absolute value of \u2013.83 is large. Therefore, it is a strong negative\ncorrelation.\nCan you guess the strength and\ndirection of the correlation between\nage and year of birth? If you said this is\na strong negative correlation, you are\ncorrect! Older people always have\nlower years of birth than younger\npeople (e.g., 1950 vs. 1995), but at the\nsame time, the older people will have\na higher age (e.g., 65 vs. 20). In fact, this\nis a perfect correlation because there\nare no exceptions to this pattern. I\nchallenge you to find a 10-year-old\nborn before 2003! You can\u2019t.\nFigure 3. Scatterplot showing the association between valuing Problems with the correlation\nhappiness and GPA, a weak negative correlation (r = \u2013.32). Each dot\nrepresents an individual.\nIf generosity and happiness are\npositively correlated, should we conclude that being generous causes happiness? Similarly, if\nheight and pathogen prevalence are negatively correlated, should we conclude that disease\ncauses shortness? From a correlation alone, we can\u2019t be certain. For example, in the first case\nit may be that happiness causes generosity, or that generosity causes happiness. Or, a third\nvariable might cause both happiness and generosity, creating the illusion of a direct link\nbetween the two. For example, wealth could be the third variable that causes both greater\nhappiness and greater generosity. This is why correlation does not mean causation\u2014an often\nrepeated phrase among psychologists.\nQualitative Designs\nJust as correlational research allows us to study topics we can\u2019t experimentally manipulate (e.\ng., whether you have a large or small income), there are other types of research designs that\nallow us to investigate these harder-to-study topics. Qualitative designs, including participant\nobservation, case studies, and narrative analysis are examples of such methodologies. Research Designs 30\nAlthough something as simple as \u201cobservation\u201d may seem like it would be a part of all research\nmethods, participant observation is a distinct methodology that involves the researcher\nembedding him- or herself into a group in order to study its dynamics. For example, Festinger,\nRiecken, and Shacter (1956) were very interested in the psychology of a particular cult.\nHowever, this cult was very secretive and wouldn\u2019t grant interviews to outside members. So,\nin order to study these people, Festinger and his colleagues pretended to be cult members,\nallowing them access to the behavior and psychology of the cult. Despite this example, it\nshould be noted that the people being observed in a participant observation study usually\nknow that the researcher is there to study them.\nAnother qualitative method for research is the case study, which involves an intensive\nexamination of specific individuals or specific contexts. Sigmund Freud, the father of\npsychoanalysis, was famous for using this type of methodology; however, more current\nexamples of case studies usually involve brain injuries. For instance, imagine that researchers\nwant to know how a very specific brain injury affects people\u2019s experience of happiness.\nObviously, the researchers can\u2019t conduct experimental research that involves inflicting this\ntype of injury on people. At the same time, there are too few people who have this type of\ninjury to conduct correlational research. In such an instance, the researcher may examine\nonly one person with this brain injury, but in doing so, the researcher will put the participant\nthrough a very extensive round of tests. Hopefully what is learned from this one person can\nbe applied to others; however, even with thorough tests, there is the chance that something\nunique about this individual (other than the brain injury) will affect his or her happiness. But\nwith such a limited number of possible participants, a case study is really the only type of\nmethodology suitable for researching this brain injury.\nThe final qualitative method to be discussed in this section is narrative analysis. Narrative\nanalysis centers around the study of stories and personal accounts of people, groups, or\ncultures. In this methodology, rather than engaging with participants directly, or quantifying\ntheir responses or behaviors, researchers will analyze the themes, structure, and dialogue of\neach person\u2019s narrative. That is, a researcher will examine people\u2019s personal testimonies in\norder to learn more about the psychology of those individuals or groups. These stories may\nbe written, audio-recorded, or video-recorded, and allow the researcher not only to study\nwhat the participant says but how he or she says it. Every person has a unique perspective on\nthe world, and studying the way he or she conveys a story can provide insight into that\nperspective.\nQuasi-Experimental Designs Research Designs 31\nWhat if you want to study the effects of marriage on a variable? For example, does marriage\nmake people happier? Can you randomly assign some people to get married and others to\nremain single? Of course not. So how can you study these important variables? You can use\na quasi-experimental design.\nA quasi-experimental design is similar\nto experimental research, except that\nrandom assignment to conditions is\nnot used. Instead, we rely on existing\ngroup memberships (e.g., married vs.\nsingle). We treat these as the\nindependent variables, even though we\ndon\u2019t assign people to the conditions\nand don\u2019t manipulate the variables. As\na result, with quasi-experimental\ndesigns causal inference is more\ndifficult. For example, married people\nWhat is a reasonable way to study the effects of marriage on\nmight differ on a variety of characteristics\nhappiness? (Photo: Nina Matthews Photography)\nfrom unmarried people. If we find that\nmarried participants are happier than\nsingle participants, it will be hard to say that marriage causes happiness, because the people\nwho got married might have already been happier than the people who have remained single.\nBecause experimental and quasi-experimental designs can seem pretty similar, let\u2019s take\nanother example to distinguish them. Imagine you want to know who is a better professor:\nDr. Smith or Dr. Khan. To judge their ability, you\u2019re going to look at their students\u2019 final grades.\nHere, the independent variable is the professor (Dr. Smith vs. Dr. Khan) and the dependent\nvariable is the students\u2019 grades. In an experimental design, you would randomly assign\nstudents to one of the two professors and then compare the students\u2019 final grades. However,\nin real life, researchers can\u2019t randomly force students to take one professor over the other;\ninstead, the researchers would just have to use the preexisting classes and study them as-is\n(quasi-experimental design). Again, the key difference is random assignment to the conditions\nof the independent variable. Although the quasi-experimental design (where the students\nchoose which professor they want) may seem random, it\u2019s most likely not. For example, maybe\nstudents heard Dr. Smith sets low expectations, so slackers prefer this class, whereas Dr. Khan\nsets higher expectations, so smarter students prefer that one. This now introduces a\nconfounding variable (student intelligence) that will almost certainly have an effect on\nstudents\u2019 final grades, regardless of how skilled the professor is. So, even though a quasi-\nexperimental design is similar to an experimental design (i.e., it has a manipulated Research Designs 32\nindependent variable), because there\u2019s no random assignment, you can\u2019t reasonably draw the\nsame conclusions that you would with an experimental design.\nLongitudinal Studies\nAnother powerful research design is the longitudinal study. Longitudinal studies track the\nsame people over time. Some longitudinal studies last a few weeks, some a few months, some\na year or more. Some studies that have contributed a lot to psychology followed the same\npeople over decades. For example, one study followed more than 20,000 Germans for two\ndecades. From these longitudinal data, psychologist Rich Lucas (2003) was able to determine\nthat people who end up getting married indeed start off a bit happier than their peers who\nnever marry. Longitudinal studies like this provide valuable evidence for testing many theories\nin psychology, but they can be quite costly to conduct, especially if they follow many people\nfor many years.\nSurveys\nA survey is a way of gathering\ninformation, using old-fashioned\nquestionnaires or the Internet.\nCompared to a study conducted\nin a psychology laboratory,\nsurveys can reach a larger\nnumber of participants at a\nmuch lower cost. Although\nsurveys are typically used for\ncorrelational research, this is not\nalways the case. An experiment\nSurveys provide researchers with some significant advantages in gathering\ndata. They make it possible to reach large numbers of people while keeping can be carried out using surveys\ncosts to the researchers and the time commitments of participants relatively as well. For example, King and\nlow. Napa (1998) presented participants\nwith different types of stimuli on\npaper: either a survey completed by a happy person or a survey completed by an unhappy\nperson. They wanted to see whether happy people were judged as more likely to get into\nheaven compared to unhappy people. Can you figure out the independent and dependent\nvariables in this study? Can you guess what the results were? Happy people (vs. unhappy\npeople; the independent variable) were judged as more likely to go to heaven (the dependent\nvariable) compared to unhappy people! Research Designs 33\nLikewise, correlational research can be conducted without the use of surveys. For instance,\npsychologists LeeAnn Harker and Dacher Keltner (2001) examined the smile intensity of\nwomen\u2019s college yearbook photos. Smiling in the photos was correlated with being married\n10 years later!\nTradeoffs in Research\nEven though there are serious limitations to correlational and quasi-experimental research,\nthey are not poor cousins to experiments and longitudinal designs. In addition to selecting a\nmethod that is appropriate to the question, many practical concerns may influence the\ndecision to use one method over another. One of these factors is simply resource availability\n\u2014how much time and money do you have to invest in the research? (Tip: If you\u2019re doing a\nsenior honor\u2019s thesis, do not embark on a lengthy longitudinal study unless you are prepared\nto delay graduation!) Often, we survey people even though it would be more precise\u2014but\nmuch more difficult\u2014to track them longitudinally. Especially in the case of exploratory\nresearch, it may make sense to opt for a cheaper and faster method first. Then, if results from\nthe initial study are promising, the researcher can follow up with a more intensive method.\nBeyond these practical concerns, another consideration in selecting a research design is the\nethics of the study. For example, in cases of brain injury or other neurological abnormalities,\nit would be unethical for researchers to inflict these impairments on healthy participants.\nNonetheless, studying people with these injuries can provide great insight into human\npsychology (e.g., if we learn that damage to a particular region of the brain interferes with\nemotions, we may be able to develop treatments for emotional irregularities). In addition to\nbrain injuries, there are numerous other areas of research that could be useful in\nunderstanding the human mind but which pose challenges to a true experimental design\u2014\nsuch as the experiences of war, long-term isolation, abusive parenting, or prolonged drug\nuse. However, none of these are conditions we could ethically experimentally manipulate and\nrandomly assign people to. Therefore, ethical considerations are another crucial factor in\ndetermining an appropriate research design.\nResearch Methods: Why You Need Them\nJust look at any major news outlet and you\u2019ll find research routinely being reported. Sometimes\nthe journalist understands the research methodology, sometimes not (e.g., correlational\nevidence is often incorrectly represented as causal evidence). Often, the media are quick to\ndraw a conclusion for you. After reading this module, you should recognize that the strength\nof a scientific finding lies in the strength of its methodology. Therefore, in order to be a savvy Research Designs 34\nconsumer of research, you need to understand the pros and cons of different methods and\nthe distinctions among them. Plus, understanding how psychologists systematically go about\nanswering research questions will help you to solve problems in other domains, both personal\nand professional, not just in psychology.

Chapter 3: Biological Psychology 3\nThe Brain and Nervous System\nRobert Biswas-Diener\nThe brain is the most complex part of the human body. It is the center of consciousness and\nalso controls all voluntary and involuntary movement and bodily functions. It communicates\nwith each part of the body through the nervous system, a network of channels that carry\nelectrochemical signals.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Name the various parts of the nervous system and their respective functions\n\u2022 Explain how neurons communicate with each other\n\u2022 Identify the location and function of the limbic system\n\u2022 Articulate how the \u201cmotor strip\u201d is an example of brain region specialization\n\u2022 Name at least three neuroimaging techniques and describe how they work\nIn the 1800s a German scientist by the name of Ernst Weber conducted several experiments\nmeant to investigate how people perceive the world via their own bodies. It is obvious that\nwe use our sensory organs\u2014our eyes, and ears, and nose\u2014to take in and understand the\nworld around us. Weber was particularly interested in the sense of touch. Using a drafting\ncompass he placed the two points far apart and set them on the skin of a volunteer. When\nthe points were far apart the research participants could easily distinguish between them. As\nWeber repeated the process with ever closer points, however, most people lost the ability to\ntell the difference between them. Weber discovered that the ability to recognize these \u201cjust\nnoticeable differences\u201d depended on where on the body the compass was positioned. Your The Brain and Nervous System 40\nback, for example, is far less sensitive to touch than is the skin on your face. Similarly, the tip\nof your tongue is extremely sensitive! In this way, Weber began to shed light on the way that\nnerves, the nervous system, and the brain form the biological foundation of psychological\nprocesses.\nIn this module we will explore the\nbiological side of psychology by paying\nparticular attention to the brain and to\nthe nervous system. Understanding\nthe nervous system is vital to\nunderstanding psychology in general.\nIt is through the nervous system that\nwe experience pleasure and pain, feel\nemotions, learn and use language, and\nplan goals, just to name a few\nexamples. In the pages that follow we\nwill begin by examining how the human\nnervous system develops and then we\nwill learn about the parts of the brain\nand how they function. We will\nMeasuring \u201cjust noticeable differences.\u201d\nconclude with a section on how\nmodern psychologists study the brain.\nIt is worth mentioning here, at the start, that an introduction to the biological aspects of\npsychology can be both the most interesting and most frustrating of all topics for new students\nof psychology. This is, in large part, due to the fact that there is so much new information to\nlearn and new vocabulary associated with all the various parts of the brain and nervous system.\nIn fact, there are 30 key vocabulary words presented in this module! We encourage you not\nto get bogged down in difficult words. Instead, pay attention to the broader concepts, perhaps\neven skipping over the vocabulary on your first reading. It is helpful to pass back through with\na second reading, once you are already familiar with the topic, with attention to learning the\nvocabulary.\nNervous System development across the human lifespan\nAs a species, humans have evolved a complex nervous system and brain over millions of years.\nComparisons of our nervous systems with those of other animals, such as chimpanzees, show\nsome similarities. Researchers can also use fossils to study the relationship between brain The Brain and Nervous System 41\nvolume and human behavior over the course of evolutionary history. Homo habilis, for\ninstance, a human ancestor living about 2 million years ago shows a larger brain volume than\nits own ancestors but far less than modern homo sapiens. The main difference between\nhumans and other animals-- in terms of brain development-- is that humans have a much\nmore developed frontal cortex (the front part of the brain associated with planning).\nInterestingly, a person\u2019s unique nervous system develops over the course of their lifespan in\na way that resembles the evolution of nervous systems in animals across vast stretches of\ntime. For example, the human nervous system begins developing even before a person is\nborn. It begins as a simple bundle of tissue that forms into a tube and extends along the head-\nto-tail plane becoming the spinal cord and brain. By day 40 of gestation (40 days after\nfertilization of the egg) the spinal cord, hindbrain, midbrain and forebrain are all visibly distinct.\nWhat, exactly, is this nervous system that is developing and what does it do?\nThe nervous system can be thought of as the body\u2019s communication network that consists\nof all nerve cells. There are many ways in which we can divide the nervous system to\nunderstand it more clearly. One common way to do so is by parsing it into the central nervous\nsystem and the peripheral nervous system. Each of these can be sub-divided, in turn. Let\u2019s\ntake a closer, more in-depth look at each. And, don\u2019t worry, the nervous system is complicated\nwith many parts and many new vocabulary words. It might seem overwhelming at first but\nthrough the figures and a little study you can get it.\nThe Central Nervous System (CNS): The\nNeurons inside the Brain\nThe Central Nervous System, or CNS for short, is made\nup of the brain and spinal cord (see Figure 1). The CNS is\nthe portion of the nervous system that is encased in bone\n(the brain is protected by the skull and the spinal cord is\nprotected by the spinal column). It is referred to as\n\u201ccentral\u201d because it is the brain and spinal cord that are\nprimarily responsible for processing sensory information\n\u2014touching a hot stove or seeing a rainbow, for example\n\u2014and sending signals to the peripheral nervous system\nfor action. It communicates largely by sending electrical\nsignals through individual nerve cells that make up the\nfundamental building blocks of the nervous system,\ncalled neurons. There are approximately 100 billion Figure 1: The central nervous system The Brain and Nervous System 42\nneurons in the human brain and each has many contacts with other neurons, called synapses.\nIf we were able to magnify a view of individual neurons we would see that they are cells made\nfrom distinct parts (see Figure 2). The three main components of a neuron are the dendrites,\nthe soma, and the axon. Neurons communicate with one another by receiving information\nthrough the dendrites, which act as an antenna. When the dendrites channel this information\nto the soma, or cell body, it builds up as an electro-chemical signal. This electrical part of the\nsignal, called an action potential shoots down the axon, a long tail that leads away from the\nsoma and toward the next neuron. When people talk about \u201cnerves\u201d in the nervous system,\nit typically refers to bundles of axons that form long neural wires along which electrical signals\ncan travel. Cell-to-cell communication is helped by the fact that the soma is covered by a\nmyelin sheath\u2014a layer of fatty cells that allow the signal to travel very rapidly from neuron\nto neuron.\nFigure 2: The parts of a neuron\nIf we were to zoom in still further we could take a closer look at the synapse, the space between\nneurons (see Figure 3). Here, we would see that there is a space between neurons, called the\nsynaptic gap. To give you a sense of scale we can compare the synaptic gap to the thickness\nof a dime, the thinnest of all American coins (about 1.35 mm). You could stack approximately\n70,000 synaptic gaps in the thickness of a single coin!\nAs the action potential, the electrical signal reaches the end of the axon, tiny packets of\nchemicals, called neurotransmitters, are released. This is the chemical part of the electro-\nchemical signal. These neurotransmitters are the chemical signals that travel from one neuron\nto another, enabling them to communicate with one another. There are many different types The Brain and Nervous System 43\nof neurotransmitters and each has a specialized function. For example, serotonin affects sleep,\nhunger and mood. Dopamine is associated with attention, learning and pleasure.\nIt is amazing to realize that when you think\u2014\nwhen you reach out to grab a glass of water,\nwhen you realize that your best friend is\nhappy, when you try to remember the name\nof the parts of a neuron\u2014what you are\nexperiencing is actually electro-chemical\nimpulses shooting between nerves!\nThe Central Nervous System:\nLooking at the Brain as a Whole\nFigure 3: A view of the synapse between neurons\nIf we were to zoom back out and look at the central nervous system again we would see that\nthe brain is the largest single part of the central nervous system. The brain is the headquarters\nof the entire nervous system and it is here that most of your sensing, perception, thinking,\nawareness, emotions, and planning take place. For many people the brain is so important\nthat there is a sense that it is there\u2014inside the brain\u2014that a person\u2019s sense of self is located\n(as opposed to being primarily in your toes, by contrast). The brain is so important, in fact,\nthat it consumes 20% of the total oxygen and calories we consume even though it is only, on\naverage, about 2% of our overall weight.\nIt is helpful to examine the various parts of the brain and to understand their unique functions\nto get a better sense of the role the brain plays. We will start by looking at very general areas\nof the brain and then we will zoom in and look at more specific parts. Anatomists and\nneuroscientists often divide the brain into portions based on the location and function of\nvarious brain parts. Among the simplest ways to organize the brain is to describe it as having\nthree basic portions: the hindbrain, midbrain and forebrain. Another way to look at the brain\nis to consider the brain stem, the Cereblellum, and the Cerebrum. There is another part,\ncalled the Limbic System that is less well defined. It is made up of a number of structures that\nare \u201csub-cortical\u201d (existing in the hindbrain) as well as regions of the Cerebrum (see Figure 4).\nThe brain stem is the most basic structure of the brain and is located at the top of the spine\nand bottom of the brain. It is sometimes considered the \u201coldest\u201d part of the brain because we\ncan see similar structures in other, less evolved animals such as crocodiles. It is in charge of\na wide range of very basic \u201clife support\u201d functions for the human body including breathing,\ndigestion, and the beating of the heart. Amazingly, the brain stem sends the signals to keep The Brain and Nervous System 44\nthese processes running smoothly without any conscious effort on our behalf.\nThe limbic system is a collection of highly specialized neural structures that sit at the top of\nthe brain stem, which are involved in regulating our emotions. Collectively, the limbic system\nis a term that doesn\u2019t have clearly defined areas as it includes forebrain regions as well as\nhindbrain regions. These include the amygdala, the pituitary gland, the thalamus and the\nhypothalamus. These structures influence hunger, the sleep-wake cycle, sexual desire, fear\nand aggression, and even memory.\nThe cerebellum is a structure at the very back of the brain. Aristotle referred to it as the \u201csmall\nbrain\u201d based on its appearance and it is principally involved with movement and posture\nalthough it is also associated with a variety of other thinking processes. The cerebellum, like\nthe brain stem, coordinates actions without the need for any conscious awareness. This is\nwhy reflexes can sometimes seem so automatic.\nThe cerebrum (also called the\n\u201ccerebral cortex\u201d) is the \u201cnewest,\u201d\nmost advanced portion of the\nbrain. The cerebral hemispheres\n(the left and right hemispheres\nthat make up each side of the top\nof the brain) are in charge of the\ntypes of processes that are\nassociated with more awareness\nand voluntary control such as\nspeaking and planning as well as\ncontain our primary sensory areas\n(such as seeing, hearing, feeling,\nFigure 4: General areas of the brain (Image: biology corner)\nand moving). These two hemispheres\nare connected to one another by a thick bundle of neurons called the corpus callosum. There\nare instances in which people\u2014either because of a genetic abnormality or as the result of\nsurgery\u2014have had their corpus callosum severed so that the two halves of the brain cannot\neasily communicate with one another. The rare split-brain patients offer helpful insights into\nhow the brain works. For example, we now understand that the brain is contralateral, or\nopposite-sided. This means that the left side of the brain is responsible for controlling a\nnumber of sensory and motor functions of the right side of the body, and vice versa.\nConsider this striking example: A split brain patient is seated at a table and an object such as\na car key can be placed where a split-brain patient can only see it through the right visual field. The Brain and Nervous System 45\nRight visual field images will be processed on the left side of the brain and left visual field\nimages will be processed on the right side of the brain. Because language is largely associated\nwith the left side of the brain the patient who sees car key in the right visual field when asked\n\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d would answer, \u201cI see a car key.\u201d In contrast, a split-brain patient who only\nsaw the car key in the left visual field, thus the information went to the non-language right\nside of the brain, might have a difficult time speaking the word \u201ccar key.\u201d In fact in this case,\nthe patient is likely to respond \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything at all.\u201d However, if asked to draw the item\nwith their left hand\u2014a process associated with the right side of the brain\u2014the patient will be\nable to do so! See the outside resources below for a video demonstration of this striking\nphenomenon.\nBesides looking at the brain as an organ that is made up of two halves we can also examine\nit by looking at its four various lobes of the cerebral cortex, the outer part of the brain (see\nFigure 5). Each of these is associated with a specific function. The occipital lobe, located at\nthe back of the cerebral cortex, is the house of the visual area of the brain. You can see the\nroad in front of you when you are driving, track the motion of a ball in the air, and recognize\nfaces thanks to the occipital lobe. The temporal lobe, located on the underside of the cerebral\ncortex, is where sounds and smells are processed. The parietal lobe, at the upper back of the\ncerebral cortex, is where touch and taste are processed. Finally, the frontal lobe, located at\nthe forward part of the cerebral cortex is where behavioral motor plans are processed as well\nas a number of highly complicated processes occur including speech and language use,\ncreative problem solving, and planning and organization.\nOne particularly fascinating area in\nthe frontal lobe is called the \u201cmotor\nstrip\u201d (okay, scientists call it the\ncentral sulcus but haven\u2019t you had\nenough new vocabulary for the\ntime being?). This strip running\nalong the side of the brain is in\ncharge of voluntary movements\nlike waving goodbye, wiggling your\neyebrows, and kissing. It is an\nexcellent example of the way that\nthe various regions of the brain are\nFigure 5: The 4 lobes of the cerebral cortex highly specialized. Interestingly,\neach of our various body parts has\na unique portion of the motor strip devoted to it (see Figure 6). Each individual finger has\nabout as much dedicated brain space as your entire leg. Your lips, in turn, require about as The Brain and Nervous System 46\nmuch dedicated brain processing as all of your fingers and your hand combined!\nFigure 6: The motor strip\nBecause the cerebral cortex in general, and the frontal lobe in particular, are associated with\nsuch sophisticated functions as planning and being self-aware they are often thought of as a\nhigher, less primal portion of the brain. Indeed, other animals such as rats and kangaroos\nwhile they do have frontal regions of their brain do not have the same level of development\nin the cerebral cortices. The closer an animal is to humans on the evolutionary tree\u2014think\nchimpanzees and gorillas, the more developed is this portion of their brain.\nThe Peripheral Nervous System\nIn addition to the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) there is also a complex\nnetwork of nerves that travel to every part of the body. This is called the peripheral nervous\nsystem (PNS) and it carries the signals necessary for the body to survive (see Figure 7). Some\nof the signals carried by the PNS are related to voluntary actions. If you want to type a message\nto a friend, for instance, you make conscious choices about which letters go in what order\nand your brain sends the appropriate signals to your fingers to do the work. Other processes,\nby contrast, are not voluntary. Without your awareness your brain is also sending signals to\nyour organs, your digestive system, and the muscles that are holding you up right now with\ninstructions about what they should be doing. All of this occurs through the pathways of your\nperipheral nervous system. The Brain and Nervous System 47\nFigure 7: The peripheral nervous system\nHow we study the brain\nThe brain is difficult to study because it is housed inside the thick bone of the skull. What\u2019s\nmore, it is difficult to access the brain without hurting or killing the owner of the brain. As a\nresult, many of the earliest studies of the brain (and indeed this is still true today) focused on\nunfortunate people who happened to have damage to some particular area of their brain.\nFor instance, in the 1860s a surgeon named Paul Broca conducted an autopsy on a former\npatient who had lost his powers of speech. Examining his patient\u2019s brain, Broca identified a\ndamaged area\u2014now called the \u201cBroca\u2019s Area\u201d\u2014on the left side of the brain (see Figure 8).\nOver the years a number of researchers have been able to gain insights into the function of\nspecific regions of the brain from these types of patients.\nAn alternative to examining the brains or\nbehaviors of humans with brain damage\nor surgical lesions can be found in the\ninstance of animals. Some researchers\nexamine the brains of other animals such\nas rats, dogs and monkeys. Although\nanimals brains differ from human brains\nin both size and structure there are many\nsimilarities as well. The use of animals for\nstudy can yield important insights into\nhuman brain function.\nFigure 8: Broca's Area (Image: Charlyzon)\nIn modern times, however, we do not have\nto exclusively rely on the study of people with brain lesions. Advances in technology have led The Brain and Nervous System 48\nto ever more sophisticated imaging techniques. Just as X-ray technology allows us to peer\ninside the body, neuroimaging techniques allow us glimpses of the working brain. Each type\nof imaging uses a different technique and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nPositron Emission Tomography (PET) records\nmetabolic activity in the brain by detecting the amount\nof radioactive substances, which are injected into a\nperson\u2019s bloodstream, the brain is consuming. This\ntechnique allows us to see how much an individual uses\na particular part of the brain while at rest, or not\nperforming a task. Another technique, known as\nFunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) relies\non blood flow. This method measures changes in the\nlevels of naturally occurring oxygen in the blood. As a\nbrain region becomes active, it requires more oxygen.\nThis technique measures brain activity based on this\nincrease oxygen level. This means fMRI does not\nrequire a foreign substance to be injected into the body.\nBoth PET and fMRI scans have poor temporal\nresolution , meaning that they cannot tell us exactly\nwhen brain activity occurred. This is because it takes\nseveral seconds for blood to arrive at a portion of the\nbrain working on a task.\nOne imaging technique that has better temporal\nresolution is Electroencephalography (EEG), which\nAbove: A PET scan - Below: An fMRI scan (Image:\nErik1980)\nmeasures electrical brain activity\ninstead of blood flow. Electrodes are\nplace on the scalp of participants and\nthey are nearly instantaneous in picking\nup electrical activity. Because this\nactivity could be coming from any\nportion of the brain, however, EEG is\nknown to have poor spatial resolution,\nmeaning that it is not accurate with\nAn EEG cap (Image: Chris Hope) regards to specific location. The Brain and Nervous System 49\nAnother technique, known as Diffuse Optical Imaging (DOI) can offer high temporal and\nspatial resolution. DOI works by shining infrared light into the brain. It might seem strange\nthat light can pass through the head and brain. Light properties change as they pass through\noxygenated blood and through active neurons. As a result, researchers can make inferences\nregarding where and when brain activity is happening.\nConclusion\nIt has often been said that the brain studies itself. This means that humans are uniquely\ncapable of using our most sophisticated organ to understand our most sophisticated organ.\nBreakthroughs in the study of the brain and nervous system are among the most exciting\ndiscoveries in all of psychology. In the future, research linking neural activity to complex, real\nworld attitudes and behavior will help us to understand human psychology and better\nintervene in it to help people.

Nelson\nThe goal of this module is to introduce you to the topic of hormones and behavior. This field\nof study is also called behavioral endocrinology, which is the scientific study of the interaction\nbetween hormones and behavior. This interaction is bidirectional: hormones can influence\nbehavior, and behavior can sometimes influence hormone concentrations. Hormones are\nchemical messengers released from endocrine glands that travel through the blood system\nto influence the nervous system to regulate behaviors such as aggression, mating, and\nparenting of individuals.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Define the basic terminology and basic principles of hormone\u2013behavior interactions.\n\u2022 Explain the role of hormones in behavioral sex differentiation.\n\u2022 Explain the role of hormones in aggressive behavior.\n\u2022 Explain the role of hormones in parental behavior.\n\u2022 Provide examples of some common hormone\u2013behavior interactions.\nIntroduction\nThis module describes the relationship between hormones and behavior. Many readers are\nlikely already familiar with the general idea that hormones can affect behavior. Students are\ngenerally familiar with the idea that sex-hormone concentrations increase in the blood during\npuberty and decrease as we age, especially after about 50 years of age. Sexual behavior shows Hormones & Behavior 55\na similar pattern. Most people also know about the relationship between aggression and\nanabolic steroid hormones, and they know that administration of artificial steroid hormones Hormones & Behavior 56\nsometimes results in uncontrollable, violent behavior called \u201croid rage.\u201d Many different\nhormones can influence several types of behavior, but for the purpose of this module, we will\nrestrict our discussion to just a few examples of hormones and behaviors. For example, are\nbehavioral sex differences the result of hormones, the environment, or some combination of\nfactors? Why are men much more likely than women to commit aggressive acts? Are hormones\ninvolved in mediating the so-called maternal \u201cinstinct\u201d? Behavioral endocrinologists are\ninterested in how the general physiological effects of hormones alter the development and\nexpression of behavior and how behavior may influence the effects of hormones. This module\ndescribes, both phenomenologically and functionally, how hormones affect behavior.\nTo understand the hormone-behavior relationship, it is important briefly to describe\nhormones. Hormones are organic chemical messengers produced and released by specialized\nglands called endocrine glands. Hormones are released from these glands into the blood,\nwhere they may travel to act on target structures at some distance from their origin. Hormones\nare similar in function to neurotransmitters, the chemicals used by the nervous system in\ncoordinating animals\u2019 activities. However, hormones can operate over a greater distance and\nover a much greater temporal range than neurotransmitters (Box 1). Examples of hormones\nthat influence behavior include steroid hormones such as testosterone (a common type of\nandrogen), estradiol (a common type of estrogen), progesterone (a common type of\nprogestin), and cortisol (a common type of glucocorticoid) (Table 1). Several types of protein\nor peptide (small protein) hormones also influence behavior, including oxytocin, vasopressin,\nprolactin, and leptin.\nHormones coordinate the physiology and behavior of individuals by regulating, integrating,\nand controlling bodily functions. Over evolutionary time, hormones have often been co-opted\nby the nervous system to influence behavior to ensure reproductive success. For example,\nthe same hormones, testosterone and estradiol, that cause gamete (egg or sperm) maturation\nalso promote mating behavior. This dual hormonal function ensures that mating behavior Hormones & Behavior 57\nTable 1: Prominent Hormones That Influence Behavior\noccurs when animals have mature gametes available for fertilization. Another example of\nendocrine regulation of physiological and behavioral function is provided by pregnancy.\nEstrogens and progesterone concentrations are elevated during pregnancy, and these\nhormones are often involved in mediating maternal behavior in the mothers.\nNot all cells are influenced by each and every\nhormone. Rather, any given hormone can\ndirectly influence only cells that have specific\nhormone receptors for that particular\nhormone. Cells that have these specific\nreceptors are called target cells for the\nhormone. The interaction of a hormone with\nits receptor begins a series of cellular events\nthat eventually lead to activation of\nenzymatic pathways or, alternatively, turns\non or turns off gene activation that regulates\nprotein synthesis. The newly synthesized\nproteins may activate or deactivate other\nThis is an image of oxytocin with its protein neurophysin. genes, causing yet another cascade of\nOxytocin is often called the \u201cneurotransmitter of love.\u201d To learn\ncellular events.

For example, testosterone is important for male sexual behavior. If men\nhave too little testosterone, then sexual motivation may be low, and it can be restored by\ntestosterone treatment. However, if men have normal or even elevated levels of testosterone\nyet display low sexual drive, then it might be possible for a lack of receptors to be the cause Hormones & Behavior 58\nand treatment with additional hormones will not be effective.\nHow might hormones affect behavior? In terms of their behavior, one can think of humans\nand other animals conceptually as comprised of three interacting components: (1) input\nsystems (sensory systems), (2) integrators (the central nervous system), and (3) output\nsystems, or effectors (e.g., muscles). Hormones do not cause behavioral changes. Rather,\nhormones influence these three systems so that specific stimuli are more likely to elicit certain\nresponses in the appropriate behavioral or social context. In other words, hormones change\nthe probability that a particular behavior will be emitted in the appropriate situation (Nelson,\n2011). This is a critical distinction that can affect how we think of hormone-behavior\nrelationships.\nWe can apply this three-component behavioral scheme to a simple behavior, singing in zebra\nfinches. Only male zebra finches sing. If the testes of adult male finches are removed, then\nthe birds reduce singing, but castrated finches resume singing if the testes are reimplanted,\nor if the birds are treated with either testosterone or estradiol. Although we commonly\nconsider androgens to be \u201cmale\u201d hormones and estrogens to be \u201cfemale\u201d hormones, it is\ncommon for testosterone to be converted to estradiol in nerve cells (Figure 1). Thus, many\nmale-like behaviors are associated with the actions of estrogens! Indeed, all estrogens must\nfirst be converted from androgens because of the typical biochemical synthesis process. If\nthe converting enzyme is low or missing, then it is possible for females to produce excessive\nandrogens and subsequently develop associated male traits. It is also possible for estrogens\nin the environment to affect the nervous system of animals, including people (e.g., Kidd et al.,\n2007). Again, singing behavior is most frequent when blood testosterone or estrogen\nconcentrations are high. Males sing to attract mates or ward off potential competitors from\ntheir territories.\nAlthough it is apparent from these observations that estrogens are somehow involved in\nsinging, how might the three-component framework just introduced help us to formulate\nhypotheses to explore estrogen\u2019s role in this behavior? By examining input systems, we could\ndetermine whether estrogens alter the birds\u2019 sensory capabilities, making the environmental\ncues that normally elicit singing more salient. If this were the case, then females or competitors\nmight be more easily seen or heard. Estrogens also could influence the central nervous system.\nNeuronal architecture or the speed of neural processing could change in the presence of\nestrogens. Higher neural processes (e.g., motivation, attention, or perception) also might be\ninfluenced. Finally, the effector organs, muscles in this case, could be affected by the presence\nof estrogens. Blood estrogen concentrations might somehow affect the muscles of a songbird\u2019s\nsyrinx (the vocal organ of birds). Estrogens, therefore, could affect birdsong by influencing the\nsensory capabilities, central processing system, or effector organs of an individual bird. We Hormones & Behavior 59\nFigure 1: Biochemical Pathway for Steroid Hormone Synthesis: It is important to note that testosterone\n(an androgen) can be converted to another androgen, DHT, or an estrogen, estradiol. Too much or too\nlittle of the converting enzymes can influence brain and behavior.\ndo not understand completely how estrogen, derived from testosterone, influences birdsong,\nbut in most cases, hormones can be considered to affect behavior by influencing one, two,\nor all three of these components, and this three-part framework can aid in the design of\nhypotheses and experiments to explore these issues.\nHow might behaviors affect hormones? The birdsong example demonstrates how hormones\ncan affect behavior, but as noted, the reciprocal relation also occurs; that is, behavior can\naffect hormone concentrations. For example, the sight of a territorial intruder may elevate\nblood testosterone concentrations in resident male birds and thereby stimulate singing or\nfighting behavior. Similarly, male mice or rhesus monkeys that lose a fight decrease circulating\ntestosterone concentrations for several days or even weeks afterward. Comparable results\nhave also been reported in humans. Testosterone concentrations are affected not only in\nhumans involved in physical combat, but also in those involved in simulated battles. For\nexample, testosterone concentrations were elevated in winners and reduced in losers of Hormones & Behavior 60\nregional chess tournaments.\nPeople do not have to be directly involved in a contest to have their hormones affected by\nthe outcome of the contest. Male fans of both the Brazilian and Italian teams were recruited\nto provide saliva samples to be assayed for testosterone before and after the final game of\nthe World Cup soccer match in 1994. Brazil and Italy were tied going into the final game, but\nBrazil won on a penalty kick at the last possible moment. The Brazilian fans were elated and\nthe Italian fans were crestfallen. When the samples were assayed, 11 of 12 Brazilian fans who\nwere sampled had increased testosterone concentrations, and 9 of 9 Italian fans had\ndecreased testosterone concentrations, compared with pre-game baseline values (Dabbs,\n2000).\nIn some cases, hormones can be affected by\nanticipation of behavior. For example, testosterone\nconcentrations also influence sexual motivation and\nbehavior in women. In one study, the interaction\nbetween sexual intercourse and testosterone was\ncompared with other activities (cuddling or exercise) in\nwomen (van Anders, Hamilton, Schmidt, & Watson,\n2007). On three separate occasions, women provided\na pre-activity, post-activity, and next-morning saliva\nsample. After analysis, the women\u2019s testosterone was\ndetermined to be elevated prior to intercourse as\ncompared to other times. Thus, an anticipatory\nrelationship exists between sexual behavior and\ntestosterone. Testosterone values were higher post-\nintercourse compared to exercise, suggesting that\nengaging in sexual behavior may also influence\nhormone concentrations in women.\nThe expectation of events can influence one\u2019s\nhormonal activity. How do you think yours is\naffected if you anticipate going on a date with a Sex Differences\nromantic interest soon? [Image: junaidrao]\nHens and roosters are different. Cows and bulls are different. Men and women are different.\nEven girls and boys are different. Humans, like many animals, are sexually dimorphic (di, \u201ctwo\u201d;\nmorph, \u201ctype\u201d) in the size and shape of their bodies, their physiology, and for our purposes,\ntheir behavior. The behavior of boys and girls differs in many ways. Girls generally excel in\nverbal abilities relative to boys; boys are nearly twice as likely as girls to suffer from dyslexia\n(reading difficulties) and stuttering and nearly 4 times more likely to suffer from autism. Boys Hormones & Behavior 61\nare generally better than girls at tasks that\nrequire visuospatial abilities. Girls engage in\nnurturing behaviors more frequently than\nboys. More than 90% of all anorexia nervosa\ncases involve young women. Young men are\ntwice as likely as young women to suffer from\nschizophrenia. Boys are much more\naggressive and generally engage in more\nrough-and-tumble play than girls (Berenbaum,\nMartin, Hanish, Briggs, & Fabes, 2008). Many\nsex differences, such as the difference in\nSex differences in appearance are often more pronounced\naggressiveness, persist throughout adulthood.\nin nonhuman animals than in humans. Male birds\nFor example, there are many more men than\nparticularly, for example roosters, tend to have physical\nfeatures that differ from the females and also differ women serving prison sentences for violent\nsignificantly in size. [Image: John Cudworth] behavior. The hormonal differences between\nmen and women may account for adult sex\ndifferences that develop during puberty, but what accounts for behavioral sex differences\namong children prior to puberty and activation of their gonads? Hormonal secretions from\nthe developing gonads determine whether the individual develops in a male or female\nmanner. The mammalian embryonic testes produce androgens, as well as peptide hormones,\nthat steer the development of the body, central nervous system, and subsequent behavior in\na male direction. The embryonic ovaries of mammals are virtually quiescent and do not secrete\nhigh concentrations of hormones. In the presence of ovaries, or in the complete absence of\nany gonads, morphological, neural, and, later, behavioral development follows a female\npathway.\nGonadal steroid hormones have organizational (or programming) effects upon brain and\nbehavior (Phoenix, Goy, Gerall, & Young, 1959). The organizing effects of steroid hormones\nare relatively constrained to the early stages of development. An asymmetry exists in the\neffects of testes and ovaries on the organization of behavior in mammals. Hormone exposure\nearly in life has organizational effects on subsequent rodent behavior; early steroid hormone\ntreatment causes relatively irreversible and permanent masculinization of rodent behavior\n(mating and aggressive). These early hormone effects can be contrasted with the reversible\nbehavioral influences of steroid hormones provided in adulthood, which are called activational\neffects. The activational effects of hormones on adult behavior are temporary and may wane\nsoon after the hormone is metabolized. Thus, typical male behavior requires exposure to\nandrogens during gestation (in humans) or immediately after birth (in rodents) to somewhat\nmasculinize the brain and also requires androgens during or after puberty to activate these\nneural circuits. Typical female behavior requires a lack of exposure to androgens early in life Hormones & Behavior 62\nwhich leads to feminization of the brain and also requires estrogens to activate these neural\ncircuits in adulthood. But this simple dichotomy, which works well with animals with very\ndistinct sexual dimorphism in behavior, has many caveats when applied to people.\nIf you walk through any major toy store, then you will likely observe a couple of aisles filled\nwith pink boxes and the complete absence of pink packaging of toys in adjacent aisles.\nRemarkably, you will also see a strong self-segregation of boys and girls in these aisles. It is\nrare to see boys in the \u201cpink\u201d aisles and vice versa. The toy manufacturers are often accused\nof making toys that are gender biased, but it seems more likely that boys and girls enjoy\nplaying with specific types and colors of toys. Indeed, toy manufacturers would immediately\ndouble their sales if they could sell toys to both sexes. Boys generally prefer toys such as trucks\nand balls and girls generally prefer toys such as dolls. Although it is doubtful that there are\ngenes that encode preferences for toy cars and trucks on the Y chromosome, it is possible\nthat hormones might shape the development of a child\u2019s brain to prefer certain types of toys\nor styles of play behavior. It is reasonable to believe that children learn which types of toys\nand which styles of play are appropriate to their gender. How can we understand and separate\nthe contribution of physiological mechanisms from learning to understand sex differences in\nhuman behaviors? To untangle these issues, animal models are often used. Unlike the situation\nin humans, where sex differences are usually only a matter of degree (often slight), in some\nanimals, members of only one sex may\ndisplay a particular behavior. As noted,\noften only male songbirds sing. Studies\nof such strongly sex-biased behaviors\nare particularly valuable for understanding\nthe interaction among behavior, hormones,\nand the nervous system.\nA study of vervet monkeys calls into\nquestion the primacy of learning in the\nestablishment of toy preferences (Alexander\n& Hines, 2002). Female vervet monkeys\npreferred girl-typical toys, such as dolls\nor cooking pots, whereas male vervet\nmonkeys preferred boy-typical toys,\nsuch as cars or balls. There were no sex\ndifferences in preference for gender-\nIf you think back to the toys and clothing you played with and wore\nneutral toys, such as picture books or\nin your youth, do you think they were more a result of your hormonal\nstuffed animals. Presumably, monkeys activity or the choices that society and your parents made for you?\nhave no prior concept of \u201cboy\u201d or \u201cgirl\u201d [Image: Sam Agnew] Hormones & Behavior 63\ntoys. Young rhesus monkeys also show similar toy preferences.\nWhat then underlies the sex difference in toy preference? It is possible that certain attributes\nof toys (or objects) appeal to either boys or girls. Toys that appeal to boys or male vervet or\nrhesus monkeys, in this case, a ball or toy car, are objects that can be moved actively through\nspace, toys that can be incorporated into active, rough and tumble play. The appeal of toys\nthat girls or female vervet monkeys prefer appears to be based on color. Pink and red (the\ncolors of the doll and pot) may provoke attention to infants.\nSociety may reinforce such stereotypical responses to gender-typical toys. The sex differences\nin toy preferences emerge by 12 or 24 months of age and seem fixed by 36 months of age,\nbut are sex differences in toy preference present during the first year of life? It is difficult to\nask pre-verbal infants what they prefer, but in studies where the investigators examined the\namount of time that babies looked at different toys, eye-tracking data indicate that infants as\nyoung as 3 months showed sex differences in toy preferences; girls preferred dolls, whereas\nboys preferred trucks. Another result that suggests, but does not prove, that hormones are\ninvolved in toy preferences is the observation that girls diagnosed with congenital adrenal\nhyperplasia (CAH), whose adrenal glands produce varying amounts of androgens early in life,\nplayed with masculine toys more often than girls without CAH. Further, a dose-response\nrelationship between the extent of the disorder (i.e., degree of fetal androgen exposure) and\ndegree of masculinization of play behavior was observed. Are the sex differences in toy\npreferences or play activity, for example, the inevitable consequences of the differential\nendocrine environments of boys and girls, or are these differences imposed by cultural\npractices and beliefs? Are these differences the result of receiving gender-specific toys from\nan early age, or are these differences some combination of endocrine and cultural factors?\nAgain, these are difficult questions to unravel in people.\nEven when behavioral sex differences appear early in development, there seems to be some\nquestion regarding the influences of societal expectations. One example is the pattern of\nhuman play behavior during which males are more physical; this pattern is seen in a number\nof other species including nonhuman primates, rats, and dogs. Is the difference in the\nfrequency of rough-and-tumble play between boys and girls due to biological factors\nassociated with being male or female, or is it due to cultural expectations and learning? If\nthere is a combination of biological and cultural influences mediating the frequency of rough-\nand-tumble play, then what proportion of the variation between the sexes is due to biological\nfactors and what proportion is due to social influences? Importantly, is it appropriate to talk\nabout \u201cnormal\u201d sex differences when these traits virtually always arrange themselves along\na continuum rather than in discrete categories? Hormones & Behavior 64\nSex differences are common in humans and in nonhuman animals. Because males and\nfemales differ in the ratio of androgenic and estrogenic steroid hormone concentrations,\nbehavioral endocrinologists have been particularly interested in the extent to which behavioral\nsex differences are mediated by hormones. The process of becoming female or male is called\nsexual differentiation. The primary step in sexual differentiation occurs at fertilization. In\nmammals, the ovum (which always contains an X chromosome) can be fertilized by a sperm\nbearing either a Y or an X chromosome; this process is called sex determination. The\nchromosomal sex of homogametic mammals (XX) is female; the chromosomal sex of\nheterogametic mammals (XY) is male. Chromosomal sex determines gonadal sex. Virtually\nall subsequent sexual differentiation is typically the result of differential exposure to gonadal\nsteroid hormones. Thus, gonadal sex determines hormonal sex, which regulates\nmorphological sex. Morphological differences in the central nervous system, as well as in\nsome effector organs, such as muscles, lead to behavioral sex differences. The process of\nsexual differentiation is complicated, and the potential for errors is present. Perinatal\nexposure to androgens is the most common cause of anomalous sexual differentiation among\nfemales. The source of androgen may be internal (e.g., secreted by the adrenal glands) or\nexternal (e.g., exposure to environmental estrogens). Turner syndrome results when the\nsecond X chromosome is missing or damaged; these individuals possess dysgenic ovaries\nand are not exposed to steroid hormones until puberty. Interestingly, women with Turner\nsyndrome often have impaired spatial memory.\nFemale mammals are considered the \u201cneutral\u201d sex; additional physiological steps are required\nfor male differentiation, and more steps bring more possibilities for errors in differentiation.\nSome examples of male anomalous sexual differentiation include 5\u03b1-reductase deficiency\n(in which XY individuals are born with ambiguous genitalia because of a lack of\ndihydrotestosterone and are reared as females, but masculinization occurs during puberty)\nand androgen insensitivity syndrome or TFM (in which XY individuals lack receptors for\nandrogens and develop as females). By studying individuals who do not neatly fall into the\ndichotic boxes of female or male and for whom the process of sexual differentiation is atypical,\nbehavioral endocrinologists glean hints about the process of typical sexual differentiation.\nWe may ultimately want to know how hormones mediate sex differences in the human brain\nand behavior (to the extent to which these differences occur). To understand the mechanisms\nunderlying sex differences in the brain and behavior, we return to the birdsong example. Birds\nprovide the best evidence that behavioral sex differences are the result of hormonally induced\nstructural changes in the brain (Goodson, Saldanha, Hahn, & Soma, 2005). In contrast to\nmammals, in which structural differences in neural tissues have not been directly linked to\nbehavior, structural differences in avian brains have been directly linked to a sexually behavior:\nbirdsong. Hormones & Behavior 65\nSeveral brain regions in songbirds display significant sex differences in size. Two major brain\ncircuit pathways, (1) the song production motor pathway and (2) the auditory transmission\npathway, have been implicated in the learning and production of birdsong. Some parts of the\nsong production pathway of male zebra finches are 3 to 6 times larger than those of female\nconspecifics. The larger size of these brain areas reflects that neurons in these nuclei are\nlarger, more numerous, and farther apart. Although castration of adult male birds reduces\nsinging, it does not reduce the size of the brain nuclei controlling song production. Similarly,\nandrogen treatment of adult female zebra finches does not induce changes either in singing\nor in the size of the song control regions. Thus, activational effects of steroid hormones do\nnot account for the sex differences in singing behavior or brain nucleus size in zebra finches.\nThe sex differences in these structures are organized or programmed in the egg by estradiol\n(masculinizes) or the lack of steroids (feminizes).\nTaken together, estrogens appear to be necessary to activate the neural machinery underlying\nthe song system in birds. The testes of birds primarily produce androgens, which enter the\ncirculation. The androgens enter neurons containing aromatase, which converts them to\nestrogens. Indeed, the brain is the primary source of estrogens, which activate masculine\nbehaviors in many bird species.\nFigure 2: The sexually dimorphic nuclei of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) Gonadal steroid hormones have organizing effects upon\nbrain and behavior. The organizing effects of steroid hormones are relatively constrained to the early stages of development.\nExposure to testosterone (which is converted to estradiol) or estradiol causes masculinization of the brain. These are cross-\nsections through the brains of rats that show a male (left), a female (center), and a female treated with testosterone as a newborn\n(right). Note that the SDN-POA (the dark cell bodies) of the male are substantially larger than those of the untreated female but\nare equal in size to those of the testosterone-treated female. The extent that these sex differences in brain structure account\nfor sex differences in behavior remain unspecified in mammals. OC = optic chiasm; SCN = suprachiasmatic nucleus; V = third\nventricle. Hormones & Behavior 66\nSex differences in human brain size have been reported for years. More recently, sex\ndifferences in specific brain structures have been discovered (Figure 2). Sex differences in a\nnumber of cognitive functions have also been reported. Females are generally more sensitive\nto auditory information, whereas males are more sensitive to visual information. Females are\nalso typically more sensitive than males to taste and olfactory input. Women display less\nlateralization of cognitive functions than men. On average, females generally excel in verbal,\nperceptual, and fine motor skills, whereas males outperform females on quantitative and\nvisuospatial tasks, including map reading and direction finding. Although reliable sex\ndifferences can be documented, these differences in ability are slight. It is important to note\nthat there is more variation within each sex than between the sexes for most cognitive abilities\n(Figure 3).\nFigure 3: The Average Sex Differences in Human Performance Often Reflect Significant\nOverlap Between the Sexes There are often greater differences in performance between\nindividuals of the same sex (for example, between Steve and Rick in the figure) than\nbetween individuals of the opposite sex (for example, between Steve and Jane in the\nfigure).\nAggressive Behaviors Hormones & Behavior 67\nThe possibility for aggressive behavior exists whenever the interests of two or more\nindividuals are in conflict (Nelson, 2006). Conflicts are most likely to arise over limited resources\nsuch as territories, food, and mates. A social interaction decides which animal gains access\nto the contested resource. In many cases, a submissive posture or gesture on the part of one\nanimal avoids the necessity of actual combat over a resource. Animals may also participate\nin threat displays or ritualized combat in which dominance is determined but no physical\ndamage is inflicted.\nThere is overwhelming circumstantial evidence that androgenic steroid hormones mediate\naggressive behavior across many species. First, seasonal variations in blood plasma\nconcentrations of testosterone and seasonal variations in aggression coincide. For instance,\nthe incidence of aggressive behavior peaks for male deer in autumn, when they are secreting\nhigh levels of testosterone. Second, aggressive behaviors increase at the time of puberty,\nwhen the testes become active and blood concentrations of androgens rise. Juvenile deer do\nnot participate in the fighting during the mating season. Third, in any given species, males are\ngenerally more aggressive than females. This is certainly true of deer; relative to stags, female\ndeer rarely display aggressive behavior, and their rare aggressive acts are qualitatively\ndifferent from the aggressive behavior of aggressive males. Finally, castration typically reduces\naggression in males, and testosterone replacement therapy restores aggression to pre-\ncastration levels. There are some interesting exceptions to these general observations that\nare outside the scope of this module.\nAs mentioned, males are generally more aggressive than females. Certainly, human males\nare much more aggressive than females. Many more men than women are convicted of violent\ncrimes in North America. The sex differences in human aggressiveness appear very early. At\nevery age throughout the school years, many more boys than girls initiate physical assaults.\nAlmost everyone will acknowledge the existence of this sex difference, but assigning a cause\nto behavioral sex differences in humans always elicits much debate. It is possible that boys\nare more aggressive than girls because androgens promote aggressive behavior and boys\nhave higher blood concentrations of androgens than girls. It is possible that boys and girls\ndiffer in their aggressiveness because the brains of boys are exposed to androgens prenatally\nand the \u201cwiring\u201d of their brains is thus organized in a way that facilitates the expression of\naggression. It is also possible that boys are encouraged and girls are discouraged by family,\npeers, or others from acting in an aggressive manner. These three hypotheses are not mutually\nexclusive, but it is extremely difficult to discriminate among them to account for sex differences\nin human aggressiveness.\nWhat kinds of studies would be necessary to assess these hypotheses? It is usually difficult\nto separate out the influences of environment and physiology on the development of behavior Hormones & Behavior 68\nin humans. For example, boys and girls differ\nin their rough-and-tumble play at a very\nyoung age, which suggests an early\nphysiological influence on aggression.\nHowever, parents interact with their male and\nfemale offspring differently; they usually play\nmore roughly with male infants than with\nfemales, which suggests that the sex\ndifference in aggressiveness is partially\nlearned. This difference in parental interaction\nstyle is evident by the first week of life.\nBecause of these complexities in the factors\ninfluencing human behavior, the study of\nhormonal effects on sex-differentiated\nResearchers have electrically stimulated particular regions in\nbehavior has been pursued in nonhuman\npeople\u2019s brains, and these individuals have burst into\nanimals, for which environmental influences\naggressive, violent behavior, helping demonstrate that such\ncan be held relatively constant. Animal\nresponses are hardwired into us. [Image: Riccardo Cuppini]\nmodels for which sexual differentiation\noccurs postnatally are often used so that this process can be easily manipulated\nexperimentally.\nAgain, with the appropriate animal model, we can address the questions posed above: Is the\nsex difference in aggression due to higher adult blood concentrations of androgens in males\nthan in females, or are males more aggressive than females because their brains are organized\ndifferently by perinatal hormones? Are males usually more aggressive than females because\nof an interaction of early and current blood androgen concentrations? If male mice are\ncastrated prior to their sixth day of life, then treated with testosterone propionate in\nadulthood, they show low levels of aggression. Similarly, females ovariectomized prior to their\nsixth day but given androgens in adulthood do not express male-like levels of aggression.\nTreatment of perinatally gonadectomized males or females with testosterone prior to their\nsixth day life and also in adulthood results in a level of aggression similar to that observed in\ntypical male mice. Thus, in mice, the proclivity for males to act more aggressively than females\nis organized perinatally by androgens but also requires the presence of androgens after\npuberty in order to be fully expressed. In other words, aggression in male mice is both\norganized and activated by androgens. Testosterone exposure in adulthood without prior\norganization of the brain by steroid hormones does not evoke typical male levels of aggression.\nThe hormonal control of aggressive behavior in house mice is thus similar to the hormonal\nmediation of heterosexual male mating behavior in other rodent species. Aggressive behavior\nis both organized and activated by androgens in many species, including rats, hamsters, voles, Hormones & Behavior 69\ndogs, and possibly some primate species.\nParental Behaviors\nParental behavior can be considered to be any behavior that contributes directly to the\nsurvival of fertilized eggs or offspring that have left the body of the female. There are many\npatterns of mammalian parental care. The developmental status of the newborn is an\nimportant factor driving the type and quality of parental care in a species. Maternal care is\nmuch more common than paternal care. The vast majority of research on the hormonal\ncorrelates of mammalian parental behavior has been conducted on rats. Rats bear altricial\nyoung, and mothers perform a cluster of stereotyped maternal behaviors, including nest\nbuilding, crouching over the pups to allow nursing and to provide warmth, pup retrieval, and\nincreased aggression directed at intruders. If you expose nonpregnant female rats (or males)\nto pups, their most common reaction is to huddle far away from them. Rats avoid new things\n(neophobia). However, if you expose adult rats to pups every day, they soon begin to behave\nmaternally. This process is called concaveation or sensitization and it appears to serve to\nreduce the adult rats\u2019 fear of pups.\nOf course a new mother needs to act maternal as soon as her offspring arrive\u2014not in a week.\nThe onset of maternal behavior in rats is mediated by hormones. Several methods of study,\nsuch as hormone removal and replacement therapy, have been used to determine the\nhormonal correlates of rat maternal behavior. A fast decline of blood concentrations of\nprogesterone in late pregnancy after sustained high concentrations of this hormone, in\ncombination with high concentrations of estradiol and probably prolactin and oxytocin,\ninduces female rats to behave maternally almost immediately in the presence of pups. This\npattern of hormones at parturition overrides the usual fear response of adult rats toward\npups, and it permits the onset of maternal behavior. Thus, the so-called maternal \u201cinstinct\u201d\nrequires hormones to increase the approach tendency and lower the avoidance tendency.\nLaboratory strains of mice and rats are usually docile, but mothers can be quite aggressive\ntoward animals that venture too close to their litter. Progesterone appears to be the primary\nhormone that induces this maternal aggression in rodents, but species differences exist. The\nrole of maternal aggression in women\u2019s behavior has not been adequately described or tested.\nA series of elegant experiments by Alison Fleming and her collaborators studied the endocrine\ncorrelates of the behavior of human mothers as well as the endocrine correlates of maternal\nattitudes as expressed in self-report questionnaires. Responses such as patting, cuddling, or\nkissing the baby were called affectionate behaviors; talking, singing, or cooing to the baby\nwere considered vocal behaviors. Both affectionate and vocal behaviors were considered Hormones & Behavior 70\napproach behaviors. Basic caregiving activities, such as changing diapers and burping the\ninfants, were also recorded. In these studies, no relationship between hormone\nconcentrations and maternal responsiveness, as measured by attitude questionnaires, was\nfound. For example, most women showed an increasing positive self-image during early\npregnancy that dipped during the second half of pregnancy, but recovered after parturition.\nA related dip in feelings of maternal engagement occurred during late pregnancy, but\nrebounded substantially after birth in most women. However, when behavior, rather than\nquestionnaire responses, was compared with hormone concentrations, a different story\nemerged. Blood plasma concentrations of cortisol were positively associated with approach\nbehaviors. In other words, women who had high concentrations of blood cortisol, in samples\nobtained immediately before or after nursing, engaged in more physically affectionate\nbehaviors and talked more often to their babies than mothers with low cortisol concentrations.\nAdditional analyses from this study revealed that the correlation was even greater for mothers\nthat had reported positive maternal regard (feelings and attitudes) during gestation. Indeed,\nnearly half of the variation in maternal behavior among women could be accounted for by\ncortisol concentrations and positive maternal attitudes during pregnancy.\nPresumably, cortisol does not induce\nmaternal behaviors directly, but it may\nact indirectly on the quality of maternal\ncare by evoking an increase in the\nmother\u2019s general level of arousal, thus\nincreasing her responsiveness to\ninfant-generated cues. New mothers\nwith high cortisol concentrations were\nalso more attracted to their infant\u2019s\nodors, were superior in identifying their\ninfants, and generally found cues from\ninfants highly appealing (Fleming,\nAlthough cortisol may not directly increase maternal behaviors, the\nnext time your mom does your laundry, you know one hormone to Steiner, & Corter, 1997).\nthank. [Image: Scott & Elaine van der Chijs]\nThe medial preoptic area is critical for\nthe expression of rat maternal behavior. The amygdala appears to tonically inhibit the\nexpression of maternal behavior. Adult rats are fearful of pups, a response that is apparently\nmediated by chemosensory information. Lesions of the amygdala or afferent sensory\npathways from the vomeronasal organ to the amygdala disinhibit the expression of maternal\nbehavior. Hormones or sensitization likely act to disinhibit the amygdala, thus permitting the\noccurrence of maternal behavior. Although correlations have been established, direct\nevidence of brain structural changes in human mothers remains unspecified (Fleming & Hormones & Behavior 71\nGonzalez, 2009).\nConsidered together, there are many examples of hormones influencing behavior and of\nbehavior feeding back to influence hormone secretion. More and more examples of hormone\u2013\nbehavior interactions are discovered, including hormones in the mediation of food and fluid\nintake, social interactions, salt balance, learning and memory, stress coping, as well as\npsychopathology including depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, postpartum\ndepression, and seasonal depression. Additional research should reveal how these hormone\u2013\nbehavior interactions are mediated. Hormones & Behavior 72\nOutside Resources\nBook: Adkins-Regan, E. (2005).

Chapter 4: Sensation & Perception 5\nSensation and Perception\nAdam John Privitera\nThe topics of sensation and perception are among the oldest and most important in all of\npsychology. People are equipped with senses such as sight, hearing and taste that help us to\ntake in the world around us. Amazingly, our senses have the ability to convert real-world\ninformation into electrical information that can be processed by the brain. The way we\ninterpret this information-- our perceptions-- is what leads to our experiences of the world.\nIn this module, you will learn about the biological processes of sensation and how these can\nbe combined to create perceptions.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Differentiate the processes of sensation and perception.\n\u2022 Explain the basic principles of sensation and perception.\n\u2022 Describe the function of each of our senses.\n\u2022 Outline the anatomy of the sense organs and their projections to the nervous system.\n\u2022 Apply knowledge of sensation and perception to real world examples.\n\u2022 Explain the consequences of multimodal perception.\nIntroduction\nOnce I was hiking at Cape Lookout State Park in Tillamook, Oregon. After passing through\na vibrantly colored, pleasantly scented, temperate rainforest, I arrived at a cliff overlooking Sensation and Perception 80\nthe Pacific Ocean. I grabbed the cold metal\nrailing near the edge and looked out at the\nsea. Below me, I could see a pod of sea lions\nswimming in the deep blue water. All\naround me I could smell the salt from the\nsea and the scent of wet, fallen leaves.\nThis description of a single memory highlights\nthe way a person\u2019s senses are so important to\nour experience of the world around us.\nBefore discussing each of our extraordinary\nsenses individually, it is necessary to cover\nsome basic concepts that apply to all of them. Our senses combine to create our perceptions of the world\nIt is probably best to start with one very [Image: Adam John Privitera]\nimportant distinction that can often be\nconfusing: the difference between sensation and perception. The physical process during\nwhich our sensory organs\u2014those involved with hearing and taste, for example\u2014respond to\nexternal stimuli is called sensation. Sensation happens when you eat noodles or feel the wind\non your face or hear a car horn honking in the distance. During sensation, our sense organs\nare engaging in transduction, the conversion of one form of energy into another. Physical\nenergy such as light or a sound wave is converted into a form of energy the brain can\nunderstand: electrical stimulation. After our brain receives the electrical signals, we make\nsense of all this stimulation and begin to appreciate the complex world around us. This\npsychological process\u2014making sense of the stimuli\u2014is called perception. It is during this\nprocess that you are able to identify a gas leak in your home or a song that reminds you of a\nspecific afternoon spent with friends.\nRegardless of whether we are talking about sight or taste or any of the individual senses, there\nare a number of basic principles that influence the way our sense organs work. The first of\nthese influences is our ability to detect an external stimulus. Each sense organ\u2014our eyes or\ntongue, for instance\u2014requires a minimal amount of stimulation needed in order to detect a\nstimulus. This absolute threshold explains why you don\u2019t smell the perfume someone is\nwearing in a classroom unless they are somewhat close to you.\nThe way we measure absolute thresholds is by using a method called signal detection. This\nprocess involves presenting stimuli of varying intensities to a research participant in order to\ndetermine the level at which he or she can reliably detect stimulation in a given sense. During\none type of hearing test, for example, a person listens to increasingly louder tones (starting Sensation and Perception 81\nfrom silence) in an effort to determine the threshold at which he or she begins to hear (see\nAdditional Resources for a video demonstration of a high-frequency ringtone that can only\nbe heard by young people). Correctly indicating that a sound was heard is called a hit; failing\nto do so is called a miss. Additionally, indicating that a sound was heard when one wasn\u2019t\nplayed is called a false alarm, and correctly identifying when a sound wasn\u2019t played is a correct\nrejection.\nThrough these and other studies, we have been able to gain an understanding of just how\nremarkable our senses are. For example, the human eye is capable of detecting candlelight\nfrom 30 miles away in the dark. We are also capable of hearing the ticking of a watch in a quiet\nenvironment from 20 feet away. If you think that\u2019s amazing, I encourage you to read more\nabout the extreme sensory capabilities of nonhuman animals; many animals possess what\nwe would consider super-human abilities.\nA similar principle to the absolute threshold discussed above underlies our ability to detect\nthe difference between two stimuli of different intensities. The differential threshold, or just\nnoticeable difference (JND), for each sense has been studied using similar methods to signal\ndetection. To illustrate, find a friend and a few objects of known weight (you\u2019ll need objects\nthat weigh 1, 2, 10 and 11 lbs.\u2014or in metric terms: 1, 2, 5 and 5.5 kg). Have your friend hold\nthe lightest object (1 lb. or 1 kg). Then, replace this object with the next heaviest and ask him\nor her to tell you which one weighs more. Reliably, your friend will say the second object every\nsingle time. It\u2019s extremely easy to tell the difference when something weighs double what\nanother weighs! However, it is not so easy when the difference is a smaller percentage of the\noverall weight. It will be much harder for your friend to reliably tell the difference between 10\nand 11 lbs. (or 5 versus 5.5 kg) than it is for 1 and 2 lbs. This is phenomenon is called Weber\u2019s\nLaw, and it is the idea that bigger stimuli require larger differences to be noticed.\nCrossing into the world of perception, it is clear that our experience influences how our brain\nprocesses things. You have tasted food that you like and food that you don\u2019t like. There are\nsome bands you enjoy and others you can\u2019t stand. However, during the time you first eat\nsomething or hear a band, you process those stimuli using bottom-up processing. This is\nwhen we build up to perception from the individual pieces. Sometimes, though, stimuli we\u2019ve\nexperienced in our past will influence how we process new ones. This is called top-down\nprocessing. The best way to illustrate these two concepts is with our ability to read. Read the\nfollowing quote out loud:\nNotice anything odd while you were reading the text in the triangle? Did you notice the second\n\u201cthe\u201d? If not, it\u2019s likely because you were reading this from a top-down approach. Having a\nsecond \u201cthe\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense. We know this. Our brain knows this and doesn\u2019t expect there Sensation and Perception 82\nFigure 1. An example of stimuli processing.\nto be a second one, so we have a tendency to skip right over it. In other words, your past\nexperience has changed the way you perceive the writing in the triangle! A beginning reader\n\u2014one who is using a bottom-up approach by carefully attending to each piece\u2014would be\nless likely to make this error.\nFinally, it should be noted that when we experience a sensory stimulus that doesn\u2019t change,\nwe stop paying attention to it. This is why we don\u2019t feel the weight of our clothing, hear the\nhum of a projector in a lecture hall, or see all the tiny scratches on the lenses of our glasses.\nWhen a stimulus is constant and unchanging, we experience sensory adaptation. During this\nprocess we become less sensitive to that stimulus. A great example of this occurs when we\nleave the radio on in our car after we park it at home for the night. When we listen to the radio\non the way home from work the volume seems reasonable. However, the next morning when\nwe start the car, we might be startled by how loud the radio is. We don\u2019t remember it being\nthat loud last night. What happened? What happened is that we adapted to the constant\nstimulus of the radio volume over the course of the previous day. This required us to continue\nto turn up the volume of the radio to combat the constantly decreasing sensitivity. However,\nafter a number of hours away from that constant stimulus, the volume that was once\nreasonable is entirely too loud. We are no longer adapted to that stimulus!\nNow that we have introduced some basic sensory principles, let us take on each one of our\nfascinating senses individually.\nVision\nHow vision works Sensation and Perception 83\nVision is a tricky matter. When we see a pizza, a feather, or a hammer, we are actually seeing\nlight bounce off that object and into our eye. Light enters the eye through the pupil, a tiny\nopening behind the cornea. The pupil regulates the amount of light entering the eye by\ncontracting (getting smaller) in bright light and dilating (getting larger) in dimmer light. Once\npast the pupil, light passes through the lens, which focuses an image on a thin layer of cells\nin the back of the eye, called the retina.\nBecause we have two eyes in different locations, the image focused on each retina is from a\nslightly different angle (binocular disparity), providing us with our perception of 3D space\n(binocular vision). You can appreciate this by holding a pen in your hand, extending your arm\nin front of your face, and looking at the pen while closing each eye in turn. Pay attention to\nthe apparent position of the pen relative to objects in the background. Depending on which\neye is open, the pen appears to jump back and forth! This is how video game manufacturers\ncreate the perception of 3D without special glasses; two slightly different images are presented\non top of one another.\nFigure 2. Diagram of the human eye. Notice the Retina, labeled here: this is the location of the\nCones and Rods in the eye [Image: wikimedia commons]. Sensation and Perception 84\nIt is in the retina that light is transduced, or converted into electrical signals, by specialized\ncells called photoreceptors. The retina contains two main kinds of photoreceptors: rods and\ncones. Rods are primarily responsible for our ability to see in dim light conditions, such as\nduring the night. Cones, on the other hand, provide us with the ability to see color and fine\ndetail when the light is brighter. Rods and cones differ in their distribution across the retina,\nwith the highest concentration of cones found in the fovea (the central region of focus), and\nrods dominating the periphery (see Figure 2). The difference in distribution can explain why\nlooking directly at a dim star in the sky makes it seem to disappear; there aren\u2019t enough rods\nto process the dim light!\nNext, the electrical signal is sent through a layer of cells in the retina, eventually traveling down\nthe optic nerve. After passing through the thalamus, this signal makes it to the primary visual\ncortex, where information about light orientation and movement begin to come together\n(Hubel & Wiesel, 1962). Information is then sent to a variety of different areas of the cortex\nfor more complex processing. Some of these cortical regions are fairly specialized\u2014for\nexample, for processing faces (fusiform face area) and body parts (extrastriate body area).\nDamage to these areas of the cortex can potentially result in a specific kind of agnosia, whereby\na person loses the ability to perceive visual stimuli. A great example of this is illustrated in the\nwriting of famous neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks; he experienced prosopagnosia, the inability to\nrecognize faces. These specialized regions for visual recognition comprise the ventral\npathway (also called the \u201cwhat\u201d pathway). Other areas involved in processing location and\nmovement make up the dorsal pathway (also called the \u201cwhere\u201d pathway). Together, these\npathways process a large amount of information about visual stimuli (Goodale & Milner, 1992).\nPhenomena we often refer to as optical illusions provide misleading information to these\n\u201chigher\u201d areas of visual processing (see Additional Resources for websites containing amazing\noptical illusions).\nDark and light adaptation\nHumans have the ability to adapt to changes in light conditions. As mentioned before, rods\nare primarily involved in our ability to see in dim light. They are the photoreceptors responsible\nfor allowing us to see in a dark room. You might notice that this night vision ability takes\naround 10 minutes to turn on, a process called dark adaptation. This is because our rods\nbecome bleached in normal light conditions and require time to recover. We experience the\nopposite effect when we leave a dark movie theatre and head out into the afternoon sun.\nDuring light adaptation, a large number of rods and cones are bleached at once, causing us\nto be blinded for a few seconds. Light adaptation happens almost instantly compared with\ndark adaptation. Interestingly, some people think pirates wore a patch over one eye in order Sensation and Perception 85\nto keep it adapted to the dark while the other was adapted to the light. If you want to turn on\na light without losing your night vision, don\u2019t worry about wearing an eye patch, just use a red\nlight; this wavelength doesn\u2019t bleach your rods.\nColor vision\nOur cones allow us to see details\nin normal light conditions, as well\nas color. We have cones that\nrespond preferentially, not exclusively,\nfor red, green and blue (Svaetichin,\n1955). This trichromatic theory is\nnot new; it dates back to the early\n19th century (Young, 1802; Von\nHelmholtz, 1867). This theory,\nhowever, does not explain the odd\nFigure 3. State at the center of the Canadian flag for fifteen seconds. Then,\neffect that occurs when we look at\nshift your eyes away to a white wall or blank piece of paper. You should see\na white wall after staring at a\nan \"after image\" in a different color scheme.\npicture for around 30 seconds. Try\nthis: stare at the image of the flag in Figure 3 for 30 seconds and then immediately look at a\nsheet of white paper or a wall. According to the trichromatic theory of color vision, you should\nsee white when you do that. Is that what you experienced? As you can see, the trichromatic\ntheory doesn\u2019t explain the afterimage you just witnessed. This is where the opponent-process\ntheory comes in (Hering, 1920). This theory states that our cones send information to retinal\nganglion cells that respond to pairs of colors (red-green, blue-yellow, black-white). These\nspecialized cells take information from the cones and compute the difference between the\ntwo colors\u2014a process that explains why we cannot see reddish-green or bluish-yellow, as well\nas why we see afterimages. Color blindness can result from issues with the cones or retinal\nganglion cells involved in color vision.\nHearing (Audition)\nSome of the most well-known celebrities and top earners in the world are musicians. Our\nworship of musicians may seem silly when you consider that all they are doing is vibrating\nthe air a certain way to create sound waves, the physical stimulus for audition.\nPeople are capable of getting a large amount of information from the basic qualities of sound\nwaves. The amplitude (or intensity) of a sound wave codes for the loudness of a stimulus; Sensation and Perception 86\nhigher amplitude sound waves result in louder sounds. The pitch of a stimulus is coded in the\nfrequency of a sound wave; higher frequency sounds are higher pitched. We can also gauge\nthe quality, or timbre, of a sound by the complexity of the sound wave. This allows us to tell\nthe difference between bright and dull sounds as well as natural and synthesized instruments\n(V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki & Takala, 1996).\nFigure 4. Diagram of the human ear. Notice the Cochlea labeled here: it is the location of the auditory Hair Cells\nthat are tonotopically organized.\nIn order for us to sense sound waves from our environment they must reach our inner ear.\nLucky for us, we have evolved tools that allow those waves to be funneled and amplified\nduring this journey. Initially, sound waves are funneled by your pinna (the external part of\nyour ear that you can actually see) into your auditory canal (the hole you stick Q-tips into\ndespite the box advising against it). During their journey, sound waves eventually reach a thin,\nstretched membrane called the tympanic membrane (eardrum), which vibrates against the\nthree smallest bones in the body\u2014the malleus (hammer), the incus (anvil), and the stapes\n(stirrup)\u2014collectively called the ossicles. Both the tympanic membrane and the ossicles\namplify the sound waves before they enter the fluid-filled cochlea, a snail-shell-like bone\nstructure containing auditory hair cells arranged on the basilar membrane (see Figure 4)\naccording to the frequency they respond to (called tonotopic organization). Depending on\nage, humans can normally detect sounds between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It is inside the cochlea Sensation and Perception 87\nthat sound waves are converted into an electrical message.\nBecause we have an ear on each side of our head, we are capable of localizing sound in 3D\nspace pretty well (in the same way that having two eyes produces 3D vision). Have you ever\ndropped something on the floor without seeing where it went? Did you notice that you were\nsomewhat capable of locating this object based on the sound it made when it hit the ground?\nWe can reliably locate something based on which ear receives the sound first. What about\nthe height of a sound? If both ears receive a sound at the same time, how are we capable of\nlocalizing sound vertically? Research in cats (Populin & Yin, 1998) and humans (Middlebrooks\n& Green, 1991) has pointed to differences in the quality of sound waves depending on vertical\npositioning.\nAfter being processed by auditory hair cells, electrical signals are sent through the cochlear\nnerve (a division of the vestibulocochlear nerve) to the thalamus, and then the primary\nauditory cortex of the temporal lobe. Interestingly, the tonotopic organization of the cochlea\nis maintained in this area of the cortex (Merzenich, Knight, & Roth, 1975; Romani, Williamson,\n& Kaufman, 1982). However, the role of the primary auditory cortex in processing the wide\nrange of features of sound is still being explored (Walker, Bizley, & Schnupp, 2011).\nBalance and the vestibular system\nThe inner ear isn\u2019t only involved in hearing; it\u2019s also associated with our ability to balance and\ndetect where we are in space. The vestibular system is comprised of three semicircular canals\n\u2014fluid-filled bone structures containing cells that respond to changes in the head\u2019s orientation\nin space. Information from the vestibular system is sent through the vestibular nerve (the\nother division of the vestibulocochlear nerve) to muscles involved in the movement of our\neyes, neck, and other parts of our body. This information allows us to maintain our gaze on\nan object while we are in motion. Disturbances in the vestibular system can result in issues\nwith balance, including vertigo.\nTouch\nWho doesn\u2019t love the softness of an old t-shirt or the smoothness of a clean shave? Who\nactually enjoys having sand in their swimsuit? Our skin, the body\u2019s largest organ, provides us\nwith all sorts of information, such as whether something is smooth or bumpy, hot or cold, or\neven if it\u2019s painful. Somatosensation\u2014which includes our ability to sense touch, temperature\nand pain\u2014transduces physical stimuli, such as fuzzy velvet or scalding water, into electrical\npotentials that can be processed by the brain. Sensation and Perception 88\nTactile sensation\nTactile stimuli\u2014those that are associated with texture\u2014are transduced by special receptors\nin the skin called mechanoreceptors. Just like photoreceptors in the eye and auditory hair\ncells in the ear, these allow for the conversion of one kind of energy into a form the brain can\nunderstand.\nFigure 5. The Homunculus (Latin \u201clittle man\u201d) \u2013 on the left you see a human body drawn to demonstrate the areas that possess\nthe most sensitivity \u2013 lips, hands, genitals and feet. On the right you see the drawing of the somatosensory cortex in the brain\nand the areas in the human body that correspond to it - they are also drawn in proportion to the most sensitive or the most\ninnervated parts of the body.\nAfter tactile stimuli are converted by mechanoreceptors, information is sent through the\nthalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex for further processing. This region of the\ncortex is organized in a somatotopic map where different regions are sized based on the\nsensitivity of specific parts on the opposite side of the body (Penfield & Rasmussen, 1950). Sensation and Perception 89\nPut simply, various areas of the skin, such as lips and fingertips, are more sensitive than others,\nsuch as shoulders or ankles. This sensitivity can be represented with a homunculus (small\nhuman) shown in Figure 5.\nPain\nMost people, if asked, would love to get rid of pain (nociception), because the sensation is\nvery unpleasant and doesn\u2019t appear to have obvious value. But the perception of pain is our\nbody\u2019s way of sending us a signal that something is wrong and needs our attention. Without\npain, how would we know when we are accidentally touching a hot stove, or that we should\nrest a strained arm after a hard workout?\nPhantom limbs\nRecords of people experiencing phantom limbs after amputations have been around for\ncenturies (Mitchell, 1871). As the name suggests, people with a phantom limb have the\nsensations such as itching seemingly coming from their missing limb. A phantom limb can\nalso involve phantom limb pain, sometimes described as the muscles of the missing limb\nuncomfortably clenching. While the mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully\nunderstood, there is evidence to support that the damaged nerves from the amputation site\nare still sending information to the brain (Weinstein, 1998) and that the brain is reacting to\nthis information (Ramachandran & Rogers-Ramachandran, 2000). There is an interesting\ntreatment for the alleviation of phantom limb pain that works by tricking the brain, using a\nspecial mirror box to create a visual representation of the missing limb. The technique allows\nthe patient to manipulate this representation into a more comfortable position\n(Ramachandran & Rogers-Ramachandran, 1996).\nSmell and Taste: The Chemical Senses\nThe two most underappreciated senses can be lumped into the broad category of chemical\nsenses. Both olfaction (smell) and gustation (taste) require the transduction of chemical\nstimuli into electrical potentials. I say these senses are underappreciated because most people\nwould give up either one of these if they were forced to give up a sense. While this may not\nshock a lot of readers, take into consideration how much money people spend on the perfume\nindustry annually ($29 billion US Dollars). Many of us pay a lot more for a favorite brand of\nfood because we prefer the taste. Clearly, we humans care about our chemical senses. Sensation and Perception 90\nOlfaction (smell)\nUnlike any of the other senses discussed so far, the receptors involved in our perception of\nboth smell and taste bind directly with the stimuli they transduce. Odorants in our\nenvironment, very often mixtures of them, bind with olfactory receptors found in the olfactory\nepithelium. The binding of odorants to receptors is thought to be similar to how a lock and\nkey operates, with different odorants binding to different specialized receptors based on their\nshape. However, the shape theory of olfaction isn\u2019t universally accepted and alternative\ntheories exist, including one that argues that the vibrations of odorant molecules correspond\nto their subjective smells (Turin, 1996). Regardless of how odorants bind with receptors, the\nresult is a pattern of neural activity. It is thought that our memories of these patterns of activity\nunderlie our subjective experience of smell (Shepherd, 2005). Interestingly, because olfactory\nreceptors send projections to the brain through the cribriform plate of the skull, head trauma\nhas the potential to cause anosmia, due to the severing of these connections. If you are in a\nline of work where you constantly experience head trauma (e.g. professional boxer) and you\ndevelop anosmia, don\u2019t worry\u2014your sense of smell will probably come back (Sumner, 1964).\nGustation (taste)\nTaste works in a similar fashion to smell, only with\nreceptors found in the taste buds of the tongue,\ncalled taste receptor cells. To clarify a common\nmisconception, taste buds are not the bumps on\nyour tongue (papillae), but are located in small divots\naround these bumps. These receptors also respond\nto chemicals from the outside environment, except\nthese chemicals, called tastants, are contained in the\nfoods we eat. The binding of these chemicals with\ntaste receptor cells results in our perception of the\nfive basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami\n(savory)\u2014although some scientists argue that there\nare more (Stewart et al., 2010). Researchers used to\nthink these tastes formed the basis for a map-like\nGhost Pepper, also known as Bhut Jolokia is one of\norganization of the tongue; there was even a clever\nthe hottest peppers in the world, it\u2019s 10 times hotter\nrationale for the concept, about how the back of the\nthan a haba\u00f1ero, and 400 times hotter than tabasco\ntongue sensed bitter so we would know to spit out\nsauce. What, do you think would happen to your\npoisons, and the front of the tongue sensed sweet taste receptor cells if you took a bite out of this little\nso we could identify high-energy foods. However, we guy? [Image: Sally Crossthwaite] Sensation and Perception 91\nnow know that all areas of the tongue with taste receptor cells are capable of responding to\nevery taste (Chandrashekar, Hoon, Ryba, & Zuker, 2006).\nDuring the process of eating we are not limited to our sense of taste alone. While we are\nchewing, food odorants are forced back up to areas that contain olfactory receptors. This\ncombination of taste and smell gives us the perception of flavor. If you have doubts about\nthe interaction between these two senses, I encourage you to think back to consider how the\nflavors of your favorite foods are impacted when you have a cold; everything is pretty bland\nand boring, right?\nPutting it all Together: Multimodal Perception\nThough we have spent the majority of this module covering the senses individually, our real-\nworld experience is most often multimodal, involving combinations of our senses into one\nperceptual experience. This should be clear after reading the description of walking through\nthe forest at the beginning of the module; it was the combination of senses that allowed for\nthat experience. It shouldn\u2019t shock you to find out that at some point information from each\nof our senses becomes integrated. Information from one sense has the potential to influence\nhow we perceive information from another, a process called multimodal perception.\nInterestingly, we actually respond more strongly to multimodal stimuli compared to the sum\nof each single modality together, an effect called the superadditive effect of multisensory\nintegration. This can explain how you\u2019re still able to understand what friends are saying to\nyou at a loud concert, as long as you are able to get visual cues from watching them speak. If\nyou were having a quiet conversation at a caf\u00e9, you likely wouldn\u2019t need these additional cues.\nIn fact, the principle of inverse effectiveness states that you are less likely to benefit from\nadditional cues from other modalities if the initial unimodal stimulus is strong enough (Stein\n& Meredith, 1993).\nBecause we are able to process multimodal sensory stimuli, and the results of those processes\nare qualitatively different from those of unimodal stimuli, it\u2019s a fair assumption that the brain\nis doing something qualitatively different when they\u2019re being processed. There has been a\ngrowing body of evidence since the mid-90\u2019s on the neural correlates of multimodal\nperception. For example, neurons that respond to both visual and auditory stimuli have been\nidentified in the superior temporal sulcus (Calvert, Hansen, Iversen, & Brammer, 2001).\nAdditionally, multimodal \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d pathways have been proposed for auditory and\ntactile stimuli (Renier et al., 2009). We aren\u2019t limited to reading about these regions of the\nbrain and what they do; we can experience them with a few interesting examples (see Sensation and Perception 92\nAdditional Resources for the \u201cMcGurk Effect,\u201d the \u201cDouble Flash Illusion,\u201d and the \u201cRubber\nHand Illusion\u201d).\nConclusion\nOur impressive sensory abilities allow us to experience the most enjoyable and most miserable\nexperiences, as well as everything in between. Our eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin provide\nan interface for the brain to interact with the world around us. While there is simplicity in\ncovering each sensory modality independently, we are organisms that have evolved the ability\nto process multiple modalities as a unified experience.

Bouton\nBasic principles of learning are always operating and always influencing human behavior. This\nmodule discusses the two most fundamental forms of learning\u2014classical (Pavlovian) and\ninstrumental (operant) conditioning. Through them, we respectively learn to associate 1)\nstimuli in the environment, or 2) our own behaviors, with significant events, such as rewards\nand punishments. The two types of learning have been intensively studied because they have\npowerful effects on behavior, and because they provide methods that allow scientists to\nanalyze learning processes rigorously. This module describes some of the most important\nthings you need to know about classical and instrumental conditioning, and it illustrates some\nof the many ways they help us understand normal and disordered behavior in humans. The\nmodule concludes by introducing the concept of observational learning, which is a form of\nlearning that is largely distinct from classical and operant conditioning.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Distinguish between classical (Pavlovian) conditioning and instrumental (operant)\nconditioning.\n\u2022 Understand some important facts about each that tell us how they work.\n\u2022 Understand how they work separately and together to influence human behavior in the\nworld outside the laboratory.\n\u2022 Students will be able to list the four aspects of observational learning according to Social\nLearning Theory. Conditioning and Learning 106\nTwo Types of Conditioning\nAlthough Ivan Pavlov won a Nobel Prize for studying digestion, he is much more famous for\nsomething else: working with a dog, a bell, and a bowl of saliva. Many people are familiar with\nthe classic study of \u201cPavlov\u2019s dog,\u201d but rarely do they understand the significance of its\ndiscovery. In fact, Pavlov\u2019s work helps explain why some people get anxious just looking at a\ncrowded bus, why the sound of a morning alarm is so hated, and even why we swear off\ncertain foods we\u2019ve only tried once. Classical (or Pavlovian) conditioning is one of the\nfundamental ways we learn about the world around us. But it is far more than just a theory\nof learning; it is also arguably a theory of identity. For, once you understand classical\nconditioning, you\u2019ll recognize that your favorite music, clothes, even political candidate, might\nall be a result of the same process that makes a dog drool at the sound of bell.\nAround the turn of the 20th century,\nscientists who were interested in\nunderstanding the behavior of animals\nand humans began to appreciate the\nimportance of two very basic forms of\nlearning. One, which was first studied by\nthe Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov, is\nknown as classical, or Pavlovian\nconditioning. In his famous experiment,\nPavlov rang a bell and then gave a dog\nsome food. After repeating this pairing\nmultiple times, the dog eventually treated\nthe bell as a signal for food, and began\nsalivating in anticipation of the treat. This\nkind of result has been reproduced in the\nlab using a wide range of signals (e.g.,\ntones, light, tastes, settings) paired with\nmany different events besides food (e.g.,\ndrugs, shocks, illness; see below).\nThe Pavlov in All of Us: Does your dog learn to beg for food because We now believe that this same learning\nyou reinforce her by feeding her from the table? [Photo: dbmease] process is engaged, for example, when\nhumans associate a drug they\u2019ve taken\nwith the environment in which they\u2019ve taken it; when they associate a stimulus (e.g., a symbol\nfor vacation, like a big beach towel) with an emotional event (like a burst of happiness); and Conditioning and Learning 107\nwhen they associate the flavor of a food with getting food poisoning. Although classical\nconditioning may seem \u201cold\u201d or \u201ctoo simple\u201d a theory, it is still widely studied today for at least\ntwo reasons: First, it is a straightforward test of associative learning that can be used to study\nother, more complex behaviors. Second, because classical conditioning is always occurring\nin our lives, its effects on behavior have important implications for understanding normal\nand disordered behavior in humans.\nIn a general way, classical conditioning occurs whenever neutral stimuli are associated with\npsychologically significant events. With food poisoning, for example, although having fish for\ndinner may not normally be something to be concerned about (i.e., a \u201cneutral stimuli\u201d), if it\ncauses you to get sick, you will now likely associate that neutral stimuli (the fish) with the\npsychologically significant event of getting sick. These paired events are often described using\nterms that can be applied to any situation.\nThe dog food in Pavlov\u2019s experiment is called the unconditioned stimulus (US) because it\nelicits an unconditioned response (UR). That is, without any kind of \u201ctraining\u201d or \u201cteaching,\u201d\nthe stimulus produces a natural or instinctual reaction. In Pavlov\u2019s case, the food (US)\nautomatically makes the dog drool (UR). Other examples of unconditioned stimuli include\nloud noises (US) that startle us (UR), or a hot shower (US) that produces pleasure (UR).\nOn the other hand, a conditioned stimulus produces a conditioned response. A conditioned\nstimulus (CS) is a signal that has no importance to the organism until it is paired with something\nthat does have importance. For example, in Pavlov\u2019s experiment, the bell is the conditioned\nstimulus. Before the dog has learned to associate the bell (CS) with the presence of food (US),\nhearing the bell means nothing to the dog. However, after multiple pairings of the bell with\nthe presentation of food, the dog starts to drool at the sound of the bell. This drooling in\nresponse to the bell is the conditioned response (CR). Although it can be confusing, the\nconditioned response is almost always the same as the unconditioned response. However, it\nis called the conditioned response because it is conditional on (or, depends on) being paired\nwith the conditioned stimulus (e.g., the bell). To help make this clearer, consider becoming\nreally hungry when you see the logo for a fast food restaurant. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll\nstart salivating. Although it is the actual eating of the food (US) that normally produces the\nsalivation (UR), simply seeing the restaurant\u2019s logo (CS) can trigger the same reaction (CR).\nAnother example you are probably very familiar with involves your alarm clock. If you\u2019re like\nmost people, waking up early usually makes you unhappy. In this case, waking up early (US)\nproduces a natural sensation of grumpiness (UR). Rather than waking up early on your own,\nthough, you likely have an alarm clock that plays a tone to wake you. Before setting your alarm\nto that particular tone, let\u2019s imagine you had neutral feelings about it (i.e., the tone had no Conditioning and Learning 108\nprior meaning for you). However, now that you use it to wake up every morning, you\npsychologically \u201cpair\u201d that tone (CS) with your feelings of grumpiness in the morning (UR).\nAfter enough pairings, this tone (CS) will automatically produce your natural response of\ngrumpiness (CR). Thus, this linkage between the unconditioned stimulus (US; waking up early)\nand the conditioned stimulus (CS; the tone) is so strong that the unconditioned response (UR;\nbeing grumpy) will become a conditioned response (CR; e.g., hearing the tone at any point in\nthe day\u2014whether waking up or walking down the street\u2014will make you grumpy). Modern\nstudies of classical conditioning use a very wide range of CSs and USs and measure a wide\nrange of conditioned responses.\nAlthough classical conditioning is a\npowerful explanation for how we learn\nmany different things, there is a second\nform of conditioning that also helps\nexplain how we learn. First studied by\nEdward Thorndike, and later extended\nby B. F. Skinner, this second type of\nconditioning is known as instrumental\nor operant conditioning. Operant\nconditioning occurs when a behavior (as\nopposed to a stimulus) is associated\nwith the occurrence of a significant\nevent. In the best-known example, a rat\nin a laboratory learns to press a lever in\na cage (called a \u201cSkinner box\u201d) to receive\nfood. Because the rat has no \u201cnatural\u201d\nassociation between pressing a lever\nReceiving a reward can condition you toward certain behaviors. For\nand getting food, the rat has to learn this example, when you were a child, your mother may have offered you\nconnection. At first, the rat may simply this deal: \"Don't make a fuss when we're in the supermarket and\nexplore its cage, climbing on top of you'll get a treat on the way out.\" [Photo: dalioPhoto]\nthings, burrowing under things, in\nsearch of food. Eventually while poking around its cage, the rat accidentally presses the lever,\nand a food pellet drops in. This voluntary behavior is called an operant behavior, because it\n\u201coperates\u201d on the environment (i.e., it is an action that the animal itself makes).\nNow, once the rat recognizes that it receives a piece of food every time it presses the lever,\nthe behavior of lever-pressing becomes reinforced. That is, the food pellets serve as\nreinforcers because they strengthen the rat\u2019s desire to engage with the environment in this\nparticular manner. In a parallel example, imagine that you\u2019re playing a street-racing video Conditioning and Learning 109\ngame. As you drive through one city course multiple times, you try a number of different\nstreets to get to the finish line. On one of these trials, you discover a shortcut that dramatically\nimproves your overall time. You have learned this new path through operant conditioning.\nThat is, by engaging with your environment (operant responses), you performed a sequence\nof behaviors that that was positively reinforced (i.e., you found the shortest distance to the\nfinish line). And now that you\u2019ve learned how to drive this course, you will perform that same\nsequence of driving behaviors (just as the rat presses on the lever) to receive your reward of\na faster finish.\nOperant conditioning research studies how the effects of a behavior influence the probability\nthat it will occur again. For example, the effects of the rat\u2019s lever-pressing behavior (i.e.,\nreceiving a food pellet) influences the probability that it will keep pressing the lever. For,\naccording to Thorndike\u2019s law of effect, when a behavior has a positive (satisfying) effect or\nconsequence, it is likely to be repeated in the future. However, when a behavior has a negative\n(painful/annoying) consequence, it is less likely to be repeated in the future. Effects that\nincrease behaviors are referred to as reinforcers, and effects that decrease them are referred\nto as punishers.\nAn everyday example that helps to illustrate operant conditioning is striving for a good grade\nin class\u2014which could be considered a reward for students (i.e., it produces a positive emotional\nresponse). In order to get that reward (similar to the rat learning to press the lever), the student\nneeds to modify his/her behavior. For example, the student may learn that speaking up in\nclass gets him/her participation points (a reinforcer), so the student speaks up repeatedly.\nHowever, the student also learns that s/he shouldn\u2019t speak up about just anything; talking\nabout topics unrelated to school actually costs points. Therefore, through the student\u2019s freely\nchosen behaviors, s/he learns which behaviors are reinforced and which are punished.\nAn important distinction of operant conditioning is that it provides a method for studying how\nconsequences influence \u201cvoluntary\u201d behavior. The rat\u2019s decision to press the lever is voluntary,\nin the sense that the rat is free\nto make and repeat that\nresponse whenever it wants.\nClassical conditioning, on the\nother hand, is just the opposite\n\u2014depending instead on \u201cinvol\u00ad\nuntary\u201d behavior (e.g., the dog\ndoesn\u2019t choose to drool; it just\ndoes). So, whereas the rat must\n[Image: Bernard W. Balleine] actively participate and perform Conditioning and Learning 110\nsome kind of behavior to attain its reward, the dog in Pavlov\u2019s experiment is a passive\nparticipant. One of the lessons of operant conditioning research, then, is that voluntary\nbehavior is strongly influenced by its consequences.\nThe illustration on the left summarizes the basic elements of classical and instrumental\nconditioning. The two types of learning differ in many ways. However, modern thinkers often\nemphasize the fact that they differ\u2014as illustrated here\u2014in what is learned. In classical\nconditioning, the animal behaves as if it has learned to associate a stimulus with a significant\nevent. In operant conditioning, the animal behaves as if it has learned to associate a behavior\nwith a significant event. Another difference is that the response in the classical situation (e.\ng., salivation) is elicited by a stimulus that comes before it, whereas the response in the operant\ncase is not elicited by any particular stimulus. Instead, operant responses are said to be emitted.\nThe word \u201cemitted\u201d further conveys the idea that operant behaviors are essentially voluntary\nin nature.\nUnderstanding classical and operant conditioning provides psychologists with many tools for\nunderstanding learning and behavior in the world outside the lab. This is in part because the\ntwo types of learning occur continuously throughout our lives. It has been said that \u201cmuch\nlike the laws of gravity, the laws of learning are always in effect\u201d (Spreat & Spreat, 1982).\nUseful Things to Know about Classical Conditioning\nClassical Conditioning Has Many Effects on Behavior\nA classical CS (e.g., the bell) does not merely elicit a simple, unitary reflex. Pavlov emphasized\nsalivation because that was the only response he measured. But his bell almost certainly\nelicited a whole system of responses that functioned to get the organism ready for the\nupcoming US (food) (see Timberlake, 2001). For example, in addition to salivation, CSs (such\nas the bell) that signal that food is near also elicit the secretion of gastric acid, pancreatic\nenzymes, and insulin (which gets blood glucose into cells). All of these responses prepare the\nbody for digestion. Additionally, the CS elicits approach behavior and a state of excitement.\nAnd presenting a CS for food can also cause animals whose stomachs are full to eat more\nfood if it is available. In fact, food CSs are so prevalent in modern society, humans are likewise\ninclined to eat or feel hungry in response to cues associated with food, such as the sound of\na bag of potato chips opening, the sight of a well-known logo (e.g., Coca-Cola), or the feel of\nthe couch in front of the television.\nClassical conditioning is also involved in other aspects of eating. Flavors associated with certain Conditioning and Learning 111\nnutrients (such as sugar or fat) can become preferred without arousing any awareness of the\npairing. For example, protein is a US that your body automatically craves more of once you\nstart to consume it (UR): since proteins are highly concentrated in meat, the flavor of meat\nbecomes a CS (or cue, that proteins are on the way), which perpetuates the cycle of craving\nfor yet more meat (this automatic bodily reaction now a CR).\nIn a similar way, flavors associated with stomach pain or illness become avoided and disliked.\nFor example, a person who gets sick after drinking too much tequila may acquire a profound\ndislike of the taste and odor of tequila\u2014a phenomenon called taste aversion conditioning.\nThe fact that flavors are often associated with so many consequences of eating is important\nfor animals (including rats and humans) that are frequently exposed to new foods. And it is\nclinically relevant. For example, drugs used in chemotherapy often make cancer patients sick.\nAs a consequence, patients often acquire aversions to foods eaten just before treatment, or\neven aversions to such things as the waiting room of the chemotherapy clinic itself (see\nBernstein, 1991; Scalera & Bavieri, 2009).\nClassical conditioning occurs with a variety of significant events. If an experimenter sounds a\ntone just before applying a mild shock to a rat\u2019s feet, the tone will elicit fear or anxiety after\none or two pairings. Similar fear conditioning plays a role in creating many anxiety disorders\nin humans, such as phobias and panic disorders, where people associate cues (such as closed\nspaces, or a shopping mall) with panic or other emotional trauma (see Mineka & Zinbarg,\n2006). Here, rather than a physical response (like drooling), the CS triggers an emotion.\nAnother interesting effect of classical conditioning can occur when we ingest drugs. That is,\nwhen a drug is taken, it can be associated with the cues that are present at the same time (e.\ng., rooms, odors, drug paraphernalia). In this regard, if someone associates a particular smell\nwith the sensation induced by the drug, whenever that person smells the same odor afterward,\nit may cue responses (physical and/or emotional) related to taking the drug itself. But drug\ncues have an even more interesting property: They elicit responses that often \u201ccompensate\u201d\nfor the upcoming effect of the drug (see Siegel, 1989). For example, morphine itself suppresses\npain; however, if someone is used to taking morphine, a cue that signals the \u201cdrug is coming\nsoon\u201d can actually make the person more sensitive to pain. Because the person knows a pain\nsuppressant will soon be administered, the body becomes more sensitive, anticipating that\n\u201cthe drug will soon take care of it.\u201d Remarkably, such conditioned compensatory responses\nin turn decrease the impact of the drug on the body\u2014because the body has become more\nsensitive to pain.\nThis conditioned compensatory response has many implications. For instance, a drug user\nwill be most \u201ctolerant\u201d to the drug in the presence of cues that have been associated with it Conditioning and Learning 112\n(because such cues elicit compensatory responses). As a result, overdose is usually not due\nto an increase in dosage, but to taking the drug in a new place without the familiar cues\u2014\nwhich would have otherwise allowed the user to tolerate the drug (see Siegel, Hinson, Krank,\n& McCully, 1982). Conditioned compensatory responses (which include heightened pain\nsensitivity and decreased body temperature, among others) might also cause discomfort, thus\nmotivating the drug user to continue usage of the drug to reduce them. This is one of several\nways classical conditioning might be a factor in drug addiction and dependence.\nA final effect of classical cues is that they motivate ongoing operant behavior (see Balleine,\n2005). For example, if a rat has learned via operant conditioning that pressing a lever will give\nit a drug, in the presence of cues that signal the \u201cdrug is coming soon\u201d (like the sound of the\nlever squeaking), the rat will work harder to press the lever than if those cues weren\u2019t present\n(i.e., there is no squeaking lever sound). Similarly, in the presence of food-associated cues (e.\ng., smells), a rat (or an overeater) will work harder for food. And finally, even in the presence\nof negative cues (like something that signals fear), a rat, a human, or any other organism will\nwork harder to avoid those situations that might lead to trauma. Classical CSs thus have many\neffects that can contribute to significant behavioral phenomena.\n[Image: Bernard W. Balleine]\nThe Learning Process\nAs mentioned earlier, classical conditioning provides a method for studying basic learning\nprocesses. Somewhat counterintuitively, though, studies show that pairing a CS and a US\ntogether is not sufficient for an association to be learned between them. Consider an effect\ncalled blocking (see Kamin, 1969). In this effect, an animal first learns to associate one CS\u2014\ncall it stimulus A\u2014with a US. In the illustration above, the sound of a bell (stimulus A) is paired\nwith the presentation of food. Once this association is learned, in a second phase, a second Conditioning and Learning 113\nstimulus\u2014stimulus B\u2014is presented alongside stimulus A, such that the two stimuli are paired\nwith the US together. In the illustration, a light is added and turned on at the same time the\nbell is rung. However, because the animal has already learned the association between\nstimulus A (the bell) and the food, the animal doesn\u2019t learn an association between stimulus\nB (the light) and the food. That is, the conditioned response only occurs during the presentation\nof stimulus A, because the earlier conditioning of A \u201cblocks\u201d the conditioning of B when B is\nadded to A. The reason? Stimulus A already predicts the US, so the US is not surprising when\nit occurs with Stimulus B.\nLearning depends on such a surprise, or a discrepancy between what occurs on a conditioning\ntrial and what is already predicted by cues that are present on the trial. To learn something\nthrough classical conditioning, there must first be some prediction error, or the chance that\na conditioned stimulus won\u2019t lead to the expected outcome. With the example of the bell and\nthe light, because the bell always leads to the reward of food, there\u2019s no \u201cprediction error\u201d\nthat the addition of the light helps to correct. However, if the researcher suddenly requires\nthat the bell and the light both occur in order to receive the food, the bell alone will produce\na prediction error that the animal has to learn.\nBlocking and other related effects indicate that the learning process tends to take in the most\nvalid predictors of significant events and ignore the less useful ones. This is common in the\nreal world. For example, imagine that your supermarket puts big star-shaped stickers on\nproducts that are on sale. Quickly, you learn that items with the big star-shaped stickers are\ncheaper. However, imagine you go into a similar supermarket that not only uses these stickers,\nbut also uses bright orange price tags to denote a discount. Because of blocking (i.e., you\nalready know that the star-shaped stickers indicate a discount), you don\u2019t have to learn the\ncolor system, too. The star-shaped stickers tell you everything you need to know (i.e. there\u2019s\nno prediction error for the discount), and thus the color system is irrelevant.\nClassical conditioning is strongest if the CS and US are intense or salient. It is also best if the\nCS and US are relatively new and the organism hasn\u2019t been frequently exposed to them before.\nAnd it is especially strong if the organism\u2019s biology has prepared it to associate a particular\nCS and US. For example, rats and humans are naturally inclined to associate an illness with a\nflavor, rather than with a light or tone. Because foods are most commonly experienced by\ntaste, if there is a particular food that makes us ill, associating the flavor (rather than the\nappearance\u2014which may be similar to other foods) with the illness will more greatly ensure\nwe avoid that food in the future, and thus avoid getting sick. This sorting tendency, which is\nset up by evolution, is called preparedness.\nThere are many factors that affect the strength of classical conditioning, and these have been Conditioning and Learning 114\nthe subject of much research and theory (see Rescorla & Wagner, 1972; Pearce & Bouton,\n2001). Behavioral neuroscientists have also used classical conditioning to investigate many\nof the basic brain processes that are involved in learning (see Fanselow & Poulos, 2005;\nThompson & Steinmetz, 2009).\nErasing Classical Learning\nAfter conditioning, the response to the CS can be eliminated if the CS is presented repeatedly\nwithout the US. This effect is called extinction, and the response is said to become\n\u201cextinguished.\u201d For example, if Pavlov kept ringing the bell but never gave the dog any food\nafterward, eventually the dog\u2019s CR (drooling) would no longer happen when it heard the CS\n(the bell), because the bell would no longer be a predictor of food. Extinction is important for\nmany reasons. For one thing, it is the basis for many therapies that clinical psychologists use\nto eliminate maladaptive and unwanted behaviors. Take the example of a person who has a\ndebilitating fear of spiders: one approach might include systematic exposure to spiders.\nWhereas, initially the person has a CR (e.g., extreme fear) every time s/he sees the CS (e.g.,\nthe spider), after repeatedly being shown pictures of spiders in neutral conditions, pretty soon\nthe CS no longer predicts the CR (i.e., the person doesn\u2019t have the fear reaction when seeing\nspiders, having learned that spiders no longer serve as a \u201ccue\u201d for that fear). Here, repeated\nexposure to spiders without an aversive consequence causes extinction.\nPsychologists must accept one important fact about extinction, however: it does not\nnecessarily destroy the original learning (see Bouton, 2004). For example, imagine you strongly\nassociate the smell of chalkboards with the agony of middle school detention. Now imagine\nthat, after years of encountering chalkboards, the smell of them no longer recalls the agony\nof detention (an example of extinction). However, one day, after entering a new building for\nthe first time, you suddenly catch a whiff of a chalkboard and WHAM!, the agony of detention\nreturns. This is called spontaneous recovery: following a lapse in exposure to the CS after\nextinction has occurred, sometimes re-exposure to the CS (e.g., the smell of chalkboards) can\nevoke the CR again (e.g., the agony of detention).\nAnother related phenomenon is the renewal effect: After extinction, if the CS is tested in a\nnew context, such as a different room or location, the CR can also return. In the chalkboard\nexample, the action of entering a new building\u2014where you don\u2019t expect to smell chalkboards\n\u2014suddenly renews the sensations associated with detention. These effects have been\ninterpreted to suggest that extinction inhibits rather than erases the learned behavior, and\nthis inhibition is mainly expressed in the context in which it is learned (see \u201ccontext\u201d in the\nKey Vocabulary section below). Conditioning and Learning 115\nThis does not mean that extinction is a bad treatment for behavior disorders. Instead, clinicians\ncan increase its effectiveness by using basic research on learning to help defeat these relapse\neffects (see Craske et al., 2008). For example, conducting extinction therapies in contexts\nwhere patients might be most vulnerable to relapsing (e.g., at work), might be a good strategy\nfor enhancing the therapy\u2019s success.\nUseful Things to Know about Instrumental Conditioning\nMost of the things that affect the strength of classical conditioning also affect the strength of\ninstrumental learning\u2014whereby we learn to associate our actions with their outcomes. As\nnoted earlier, the \u201cbigger\u201d the reinforcer (or punisher), the stronger the learning. And, if an\ninstrumental behavior is no longer reinforced, it will also be extinguished. Most of the rules\nof associative learning that apply to classical conditioning also apply to instrumental learning,\nbut other facts about instrumental learning are also worth knowing.\nInstrumental Responses Come Under Stimulus Control\nAs you know, the classic operant response in the laboratory is lever-pressing in rats, reinforced\nby food. However, things can be arranged so that lever-pressing only produces pellets when\na particular stimulus is present. For example, lever-pressing can be reinforced only when a\nlight in the Skinner box is turned on; when the light is off, no food is released from lever-\npressing. The rat soon learns to discriminate between the light-on and light-off conditions,\nand presses the lever only in the presence of the light (responses in light-off are extinguished).\nIn everyday life, think about waiting in the turn lane at a traffic light. Although you know that\ngreen means go, only when you have the green arrow do you turn. In this regard, the operant\nbehavior is now said to be under stimulus control. And, as is the case with the traffic light, in\nthe real world, stimulus control is probably the rule.\nThe stimulus controlling the operant response is called a discriminative stimulus. It can be\nassociated directly with the response, or the reinforcer (see below). However, it usually does\nnot elicit the response the way a classical CS does. Instead, it is said to \u201cset the occasion for\u201d\nthe operant response. For example, a canvas put in front of an artist does not elicit painting\nbehavior or compel her to paint. It allows, or sets the occasion for, painting to occur.\nStimulus-control techniques are widely used in the laboratory to study perception and other\npsychological processes in animals. For example, the rat would not be able to respond\nappropriately to light-on and light-off conditions if it could not see the light. Following this\nlogic, experiments using stimulus-control methods have tested how well animals see colors, Conditioning and Learning 116\nhear ultrasounds, and detect magnetic fields. That is, researchers pair these discriminative\nstimuli with those they know the animals already understand (such as pressing the lever). In\nthis way, the researchers can test if the animals can learn to press the lever only when an\nultrasound is played, for example.\nThese methods can also be used to study \u201chigher\u201d cognitive processes. For example, pigeons\ncan learn to peck at different buttons in a Skinner box when pictures of flowers, cars, chairs,\nor people are shown on a miniature TV screen (see Wasserman, 1995). Pecking button 1 (and\nno other) is reinforced in the presence of a flower image, button 2 in the presence of a chair\nimage, and so on. Pigeons can learn the discrimination readily, and, under the right conditions,\nwill even peck the correct buttons associated with pictures of new flowers, cars, chairs, and\npeople they have never seen before. The birds have learned to categorize the sets of stimuli.\nStimulus-control methods can be used to study how such categorization is learned.\nOperant Conditioning Involves Choice\nAnother thing to know about operant\nconditioning is that the response always\nrequires choosing one behavior over\nothers. The student who goes to the bar on\nThursday night chooses to drink instead of\nstaying at home and studying. The rat\nchooses to press the lever instead of\nsleeping or scratching its ear in the back of\nthe box. The alternative behaviors are each\nassociated with their own reinforcers. And\nthe tendency to perform a particular action\ndepends on both the reinforcers earned\nfor it and the reinforcers earned for its\nalternatives.\nTo investigate this idea, choice has been\nstudied in the Skinner box by making two\nlevers available for the rat (or two buttons available for the pigeon), each of which has its own\nreinforcement or payoff rate. A thorough study of choice in situations like this has led to a\nrule called the quantitative law of effect (see Herrnstein, 1970), which can be understood\nwithout going into quantitative detail: The law acknowledges the fact that the effects of\nreinforcing one behavior depend crucially on how much reinforcement is earned for the Conditioning and Learning 117\nbehavior\u2019s alternatives. For example, if a pigeon learns that pecking one light will reward two\nfood pellets, whereas the other light only rewards one, the pigeon will only peck the first light.\nHowever, what happens if the first light is more strenuous to reach than the second one? Will\nthe cost of energy outweigh the bonus of food? Or will the extra food be worth the work? In\ngeneral, a given reinforcer will be less reinforcing if there are many alternative reinforcers in\nthe environment. For this reason, alcohol, sex, or drugs may be less powerful reinforcers if\nthe person\u2019s environment is full of other sources of reinforcement, such as achievement at\nwork or love from family members.\nCognition in Instrumental Learning\nModern research also indicates that reinforcers do more than merely strengthen or \u201cstamp\nin\u201d the behaviors they are a consequence of, as was Thorndike\u2019s original view. Instead, animals\nlearn about the specific consequences of each behavior, and will perform a behavior\ndepending on how much they currently want\u2014or \u201cvalue\u201d\u2014its consequence.\nThis idea is best illustrated by a phenomenon called the reinforcer devaluation effect (see\nColwill & Rescorla, 1986). A rat is first trained to perform two instrumental actions (e.g.,\npressing a lever on the left, and on the right), each paired with a different reinforcer (e.g., a\nsweet sucrose solution, and a food pellet). At the end of this training, the rat tends to press\nboth levers, alternating between the sucrose solution and the food pellet. In a second phase,\none of the reinforcers (e.g., the sucrose) is then separately paired with illness. This conditions\na taste aversion to the sucrose. In a final test, the rat is returned to the Skinner box and allowed\nto press either lever freely. No reinforcers are presented during this test (i.e., no sucrose or\nfood comes from pressing the levers), so behavior during testing can only result from the rat\u2019s Conditioning and Learning 118\nmemory of what it has learned earlier. Importantly here, the rat chooses not to perform the\nresponse that once produced the reinforcer that it now has an aversion to (e.g., it won\u2019t press\nthe sucrose lever). This means that the rat has learned and remembered the reinforcer\nassociated with each response, and can combine that knowledge with the knowledge that the\nreinforcer is now \u201cbad.\u201d Reinforcers do not merely stamp in responses; the animal learns\nmuch more than that. The behavior is said to be \u201cgoal-directed\u201d (see Dickinson & Balleine,\n1994), because it is influenced by the current value of its associated goal (i.e., how much the\nrat wants/doesn\u2019t want the reinforcer).\nThings can get more complicated, however, if the rat performs the instrumental actions\nfrequently and repeatedly. That is, if the rat has spent many months learning the value of\npressing each of the levers, the act of pressing them becomes automatic and routine. And\nhere, this once goal-directed action (i.e., the rat pressing the lever for the goal of getting\nsucrose/food) can become a habit. Thus, if a rat spends many months performing the lever-\npressing behavior (turning such behavior into a habit), even when sucrose is again paired with\nillness, the rat will continue to press that lever (see Holland, 2004). After all the practice, the\ninstrumental response (pressing the lever) is no longer sensitive to reinforcer devaluation.\nThe rat continues to respond automatically, regardless of the fact that the sucrose from this\nlever makes it sick.\nHabits are very common in human experience, and can be useful. You do not need to relearn\neach day how to make your coffee in the morning or how to brush your teeth. Instrumental\nbehaviors can eventually become habitual, letting us get the job done while being free to think\nabout other things.\nPutting Classical and Instrumental Conditioning Together\nClassical and operant conditioning are usually studied separately. But outside of the laboratory\nthey almost always occur at the same time. For example, a person who is reinforced for\ndrinking alcohol or eating excessively learns these behaviors in the presence of certain stimuli\n\u2014a pub, a set of friends, a restaurant, or possibly the couch in front of the TV. These stimuli\nare also available for association with the reinforcer. In this way, classical and operant\nconditioning are always intertwined.\nThe figure below summarizes this idea, and helps review what we have discussed in this\nmodule. Generally speaking, any reinforced or punished operant response (R) is paired with\nan outcome (O) in the presence of some stimulus or set of stimuli (S). Conditioning and Learning 119\nThe figure illustrates the types of associations that can be learned in this very general scenario.\nFor one thing, the organism will learn to associate the response and the outcome (R \u2013 O). This\nis instrumental conditioning. The learning process here is probably similar to classical\nconditioning, with all its emphasis on surprise and prediction error. And, as we discussed\nwhile considering the reinforcer devaluation effect, once R \u2013 O is learned, the organism will\nbe ready to perform the response if the outcome is desired or valued. The value of the\nreinforcer can also be influenced by other reinforcers earned for other behaviors in the\nsituation. These factors are at the heart of instrumental learning.\nSecond, the organism can also learn to associate the stimulus with the reinforcing outcome\n(S \u2013 O). This is the classical conditioning component, and as we have seen, it can have many\nconsequences on behavior. For one thing, the stimulus will come to evoke a system of\nresponses that help the organism prepare for the reinforcer (not shown in the figure): The\ndrinker may undergo changes in body temperature; the eater may salivate and have an\nincrease in insulin secretion. In addition, the stimulus will evoke approach (if the outcome is\npositive) or retreat (if the outcome is negative). Presenting the stimulus will also prompt the\ninstrumental response.\nThe third association in the\ndiagram is the one between the\nstimulus and the response (S \u2013 R).\nAs discussed earlier, after a lot of\npractice, the stimulus may begin\nto elicit the response directly. This\nis habit learning, whereby the\nresponse occurs relatively auto\u00ad\nmatically, without much mental\nprocessing of the relation between\nthe action and the outcome and\nthe outcome\u2019s current value.\nThe final link in the figure is\nbetween the stimulus and the\nresponse-outcome association [S \u2013 (R \u2013 O)]. More than just entering into a simple association\nwith the R or the O, the stimulus can signal that the R \u2013 O relationship is now in effect. This is\nwhat we mean when we say that the stimulus can \u201cset the occasion\u201d for the operant response:\nIt sets the occasion for the response-reinforcer relationship. Through this mechanism, the\npainter might begin to paint when given the right tools and the opportunity enabled by the\ncanvas. The canvas theoretically signals that the behavior of painting will now be reinforced Conditioning and Learning 120\nby positive consequences.\nThe figure provides a framework that you can use to understand almost any learned behavior\nyou observe in yourself, your family, or your friends. If you would like to understand it more\ndeeply, consider taking a course on learning in the future, which will give you a fuller\nappreciation of how classical learning, instrumental learning, habit learning, and occasion\nsetting actually work and interact.\nObservational Learning\nNot all forms of learning are accounted for entirely by classical and operant conditioning.\nImagine a child walking up to a group of children playing a game on the playground. The game\nlooks fun, but it is new and unfamiliar. Rather than joining the game immediately, the child\nopts to sit back and watch the other children play a round or two. Observing the others, the\nchild takes note of the ways in which they behave while playing the game. By watching the\nbehavior of the other kids, the child can figure out the rules of the game and even some\nstrategies for doing well at the game. This is called observational learning.\nObservational learning is a\ncomponent of Albert Bandura\u2019s\nSocial Learning Theory (Bandura,\n1977), which posits that individuals\ncan learn novel responses via\nobservation of key others\u2019\nbehaviors. Observational learning\ndoes not necessarily require\nreinforcement, but instead\nhinges on the presence of\nothers, referred to as social\nmodels. Social models are\ntypically of higher status or\nA child observing social models to learn the rules of a game. [Photo: horizontal.\nauthority compared to the\nintegration]\nobserver, examples of which\ninclude parents, teachers, and police officers. In the example above, the children who already\nknow how to play the game could be thought of as being authorities\u2014and are therefore social\nmodels\u2014even though they are the same age as the observer. By observing how the social\nmodels behave, an individual is able to learn how to act in a certain situation. Other examples\nof observational learning might include a child learning to place her napkin in her lap by Conditioning and Learning 121\nwatching her parents at the dinner table, or a customer learning where to find the ketchup\nand mustard after observing other customers at a hot dog stand.\nBandura theorizes that the observational learning process consists of four parts. The first is\nattention\u2014as, quite simply, one must pay attention to what s/he is observing in order to learn.\nThe second part is retention: to learn one must be able to retain the behavior s/he is observing\nin memory.The third part of observational learning, initiation, acknowledges that the learner\nmust be able to execute (or initiate) the learned behavior. Lastly, the observer must possess\nthe motivation to engage in observational learning. In our vignette, the child must want to\nlearn how to play the game in order to properly engage in observational learning.\nResearchers have conducted countless experiments designed to explore observational\nlearning, the most famous of which is Albert Bandura\u2019s \u201cBobo doll experiment.\u201d\nIn this experiment (Bandura, Ross & Ross 1961), Bandura had\nchildren individually observe an adult social model interact with\na clown doll (\u201cBobo\u201d). For one group of children, the adult\ninteracted aggressively with Bobo: punching it, kicking it,\nthrowing it, and even hitting it in the face with a toy mallet.\nAnother group of children watched the adult interact with other\ntoys, displaying no aggression toward Bobo. In both instances\nthe adult left and the children were allowed to interact with Bobo\non their own. Bandura found that children exposed to the\naggressive social model were significantly more likely to behave\naggressively toward Bobo, hitting and kicking him, compared to\nthose exposed to the non-aggressive model. The researchers\nconcluded that the children in the aggressive group used their\nobservations of the adult social model\u2019s behavior to determine\nthat aggressive behavior toward Bobo was acceptable.\nBobo [Image: wikimedia commons]\nWhile reinforcement was not required to elicit the children\u2019s behavior in Bandura\u2019s first\nexperiment, it is important to acknowledge that consequences do play a role within\nobservational learning. A future adaptation of this study (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963)\ndemonstrated that children in the aggression group showed less aggressive behavior if they\nwitnessed the adult model receive punishment for aggressing against Bobo. Bandura referred\nto this process as vicarious reinforcement, as the children did not experience the\nreinforcement or punishment directly, yet were still influenced by observing it.\nConclusion Conditioning and Learning 122\nWe have covered three primary explanations for how we learn to behave and interact with\nthe world around us. Considering your own experiences, how well do these theories apply to\nyou? Maybe when reflecting on your personal sense of fashion, you realize that you tend to\nselect clothes others have complimented you on (operant conditioning). Or maybe, thinking\nback on a new restaurant you tried recently, you realize you chose it because its commercials\nplay happy music (classical conditioning). Or maybe you are now always on time with your\nassignments, because you saw how others were punished when they were late (observational\nlearning). Regardless of the activity, behavior, or response, there\u2019s a good chance your\n\u201cdecision\u201d to do it can be explained based on one of the theories presented in this module.

Conditioning and Learning 125\nVocabulary\nBlocking\nIn classical conditioning, the finding that no conditioning occurs to a stimulus if it is combined\nwith a previously conditioned stimulus during conditioning trials. Suggests that information,\nsurprise value, or prediction error is important in conditioning.\nCategorize\nTo sort or arrange different items into classes or categories.\nClassical conditioning\nThe procedure in which an initially neutral stimulus (the conditioned stimulus, or CS) is paired\nwith an unconditioned stimulus (or US). The result is that the conditioned stimulus begins to\nelicit a conditioned response (CR). Classical conditioning is nowadays considered important\nas both a behavioral phenomenon and as a method to study simple associative learning.\nSame as Pavlovian conditioning.\nConditioned compensatory response\nIn classical conditioning, a conditioned response that opposes, rather than is the same as, the\nunconditioned response. It functions to reduce the strength of the unconditioned response.\nOften seen in conditioning when drugs are used as unconditioned stimuli.\nConditioned response (CR)\nThe response that is elicited by the conditioned stimulus after classical conditioning has taken\nplace.\nConditioned stimulus (CS)\nAn initially neutral stimulus (like a bell, light, or tone) that elicits a conditioned response after\nit has been associated with an unconditioned stimulus.\nContext\nStimuli that are in the background whenever learning occurs. For instance, the Skinner box\nor room in which learning takes place is the classic example of a context. However, \u201ccontext\u201d\ncan also be provided by internal stimuli, such as the sensory effects of drugs (e.g., being under\nthe influence of alcohol has stimulus properties that provide a context) and mood states (e.\ng., being happy or sad). It can also be provided by a specific period in time\u2014the passage of\ntime is sometimes said to change the \u201ctemporal context.\u201d Conditioning and Learning 126\nDiscriminative stimulus\nIn operant conditioning, a stimulus that signals whether the response will be reinforced. It is\nsaid to \u201cset the occasion\u201d for the operant response.\nExtinction\nDecrease in the strength of a learned behavior that occurs when the conditioned stimulus is\npresented without the unconditioned stimulus (in classical conditioning) or when the behavior\nis no longer reinforced (in instrumental conditioning). The term describes both the procedure\n(the US or reinforcer is no longer presented) as well as the result of the procedure (the learned\nresponse declines). Behaviors that have been reduced in strength through extinction are said\nto be \u201cextinguished.\u201d\nFear conditioning\nA type of classical or Pavlovian conditioning in which the conditioned stimulus (CS) is associated\nwith an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), such as a foot shock. As a consequence of\nlearning, the CS comes to evoke fear. The phenomenon is thought to be involved in the\ndevelopment of anxiety disorders in humans.\nGoal-directed behavior\nInstrumental behavior that is influenced by the animal\u2019s knowledge of the association between\nthe behavior and its consequence and the current value of the consequence. Sensitive to the\nreinforcer devaluation effect.\nHabit\nInstrumental behavior that occurs automatically in the presence of a stimulus and is no longer\ninfluenced by the animal\u2019s knowledge of the value of the reinforcer. Insensitive to the reinforcer\ndevaluation effect.\nInstrumental conditioning\nProcess in which animals learn about the relationship between their behaviors and their\nconsequences. Also known as operant conditioning.\nLaw of effect\nThe idea that instrumental or operant responses are influenced by their effects. Responses\nthat are followed by a pleasant state of affairs will be strengthened and those that are followed\nby discomfort will be weakened. Nowadays, the term refers to the idea that operant or\ninstrumental behaviors are lawfully controlled by their consequences.\nObservational learning Conditioning and Learning 127\nLearning by observing the behavior of others.\nOperant\nA behavior that is controlled by its consequences. The simplest example is the rat\u2019s lever-\npressing, which is controlled by the presentation of the reinforcer.\nOperant conditioning\nSee instrumental conditioning.\nPavlovian conditioning\nSee classical conditioning.\nPrediction error\nWhen the outcome of a conditioning trial is different from that which is predicted by the\nconditioned stimuli that are present on the trial (i.e., when the US is surprising). Prediction\nerror is necessary to create Pavlovian conditioning (and associative learning generally). As\nlearning occurs over repeated conditioning trials, the conditioned stimulus increasingly\npredicts the unconditioned stimulus, and prediction error declines. Conditioning works to\ncorrect or reduce prediction error.\nPreparedness\nThe idea that an organism\u2019s evolutionary history can make it easy to learn a particular\nassociation. Because of preparedness, you are more likely to associate the taste of tequila,\nand not the circumstances surrounding drinking it, with getting sick. Similarly, humans are\nmore likely to associate images of spiders and snakes than flowers and mushrooms with\naversive outcomes like shocks.\nPunisher\nA stimulus that decreases the strength of an operant behavior when it is made a consequence\nof the behavior.\nQuantitative law of effect\nA mathematical rule that states that the effectiveness of a reinforcer at strengthening an\noperant response depends on the amount of reinforcement earned for all alternative\nbehaviors. A reinforcer is less effective if there is a lot of reinforcement in the environment\nfor other behaviors.\nReinforcer\nAny consequence of a behavior that strengthens the behavior or increases the likelihood that Conditioning and Learning 128\nit will be performed it again.\nReinforcer devaluation effect\nThe finding that an animal will stop performing an instrumental response that once led to a\nreinforcer if the reinforcer is separately made aversive or undesirable.\nRenewal effect\nRecovery of an extinguished response that occurs when the context is changed after\nextinction. Especially strong when the change of context involves return to the context in\nwhich conditioning originally occurred. Can occur after extinction in either classical or\ninstrumental conditioning.\nSocial Learning Theory\nThe theory that people can learn new responses and behaviors by observing the behavior of\nothers.\nSocial models\nAuthorities that are the targets for observation and who model behaviors.\nSpontaneous recovery\nRecovery of an extinguished response that occurs with the passage of time after extinction.\nCan occur after extinction in either classical or instrumental conditioning.\nStimulus control\nWhen an operant behavior is controlled by a stimulus that precedes it.\nTaste aversion learning\nThe phenomenon in which a taste is paired with sickness, and this causes the organism to\nreject\u2014and dislike\u2014that taste in the future.\nUnconditioned response (UR)\nIn classical conditioning, an innate response that is elicited by a stimulus before (or in the\nabsence of) conditioning.\nUnconditioned stimulus (US)\nIn classical conditioning, the stimulus that elicits the response before conditioning occurs.\nVicarious reinforcement\nLearning that occurs by observing the reinforcement or punishment of another person.

Chapter 6: States of Consciousness 7\nStates of Consciousness\nRobert Biswas-Diener & Jake Teeny\nNo matter what you\u2019re doing--solving homework, playing a video game, simply picking out a\nshirt--all of your actions and decisions relate to your consciousness. But as frequently as we\nuse it, have you ever stopped to ask yourself: What really is consciousness? In this module,\nwe discuss the different levels of consciousness and how they can affect your behavior in a\nvariety of situations. As well, we explore the role of consciousness in other, \u201caltered\u201d states\nlike hypnosis and sleep.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Define consciousness and distinguish between high and low conscious states\n\u2022 Explain the relationship between consciousness and bias\n\u2022 Understand the difference between popular portrayals of hypnosis and how it is currently\nused therapeutically\nIntroduction\nHave you ever had a fellow motorist stopped beside you at a red light, singing his brains out,\nor picking his nose, or otherwise behaving in ways he might not normally do in public? There\nis something about being alone in a car that encourages people to zone out and forget that\nothers can see them. And although these little lapses of attention are amusing for the rest of\nus, they are also instructive when it comes to the topic of consciousness. States of Consciousness 133\nConsciousness is a term meant to indicate\nawareness. It includes awareness of the self,\nof bodily sensations, of thoughts and of the\nenvironment. In English, we use the opposite\nword \u201cunconscious\u201d to indicate senselessness\nor a barrier to awareness, as in the case of\n\u201cTheresa fell off the ladder and hit her head,\nknocking herself unconscious.\u201d And yet,\npsychological theory and research suggest\nthat consciousness and unconsciousness\nare more complicated than falling off a\nladder. That is, consciousness is more than\nThis guy is singing his heart out in his one-man mobile music\njust being \u201con\u201d or \u201coff.\u201d For instance, Sigmund\nstudio. Have you ever done this? [Image: Joshua Ommen]\nFreud (1856 \u2013 1939)\u2014perhaps the most\ninfluential psychologist of all time\u2014understood that even while we are awake, many things\nlay outside the realm of our conscious awareness (like being in the car and forgetting the rest\nof the world can see into your windows and hear your singing). In response to this notion,\nFreud introduced the concept of the \u201csubconscious\u201d (Freud, 2001) and proposed that some\nof our memories and even our basic motivations are not always accessible to our conscious\nminds.\nUpon reflection of what constitutes this \u201cawareness of consciousness,\u201d though, it is easy to\nsee how slippery a topic it is. For example, are people conscious when they\u2019re daydreaming?\nWhat about when they\u2019re drunk? Clearly, consciousness is more of a continuum than an on-\nor-off state of being. In this module, we will describe several levels of consciousness and then\ndiscuss altered states of consciousness such as hypnosis and sleep.\nLevels of Awareness\nIn 1957, a marketing researcher inserted the words \u201cEat Popcorn\u201d onto one frame of a film\nbeing shown all across the United States. And although that frame was only on screen for\n1/24th of a second\u2014a speed too fast to be perceived by conscious awareness\u2014the researcher\nreported an increase in popcorn sales by nearly 60%. Almost immediately, all forms of\n\u201csubliminal messaging\u201d were regulated in the US and banned in countries such as Australia\nand the United Kingdom. And even though it was later shown that the researcher had made\nup the data (he hadn\u2019t even inserted the words into the movie frame), this fear about influences\non our subconscious persists. At its heart, this issue pits various levels of awareness against\none another. On the one hand, we have the \u201clow awareness\u201d of subtle, even subliminal States of Consciousness 134\ninfluences. On the other hand, there is you\u2014the conscious thinking, feeling you which includes\nall that you are currently aware of, even reading this sentence. However, when we consider\nthese different levels of awareness separately, we can better understand how they operate.\nLow Awareness\nOutside of being in a coma, you are constantly receiving and evaluating sensory information.\nAlthough any moment has too many sights, smells, and sounds for them all to be consciously\nconsidered, our brains are nonetheless processing all that information. For example, have\nyou ever been at a party, overwhelmed by all the people and conversation, when out of\nnowhere you hear your name called? Even though you have no idea what else the person is\nsaying, you are somehow conscious of your name (for more on this, \u201cthe cocktail party effect,\u201d\nsee Noba\u2019s Module on Attention). So, even though you may not be aware of various stimuli in\nyour environment, your brain is paying closer attention than you think.\nSimilar to a reflex (like jumping when startled), some cues in our environment, or significant\nsensory information, will automatically elicit a response from us even though we never\nconsciously perceive it. For example, \u00d6hman and Soares (1994) took participants with a fear\nof snakes and connected them to a machine that measured subtle variations in sweating. The\nresearchers then flashed pictures of different items (e.g., mushrooms, flowers, and most\nimportantly, snakes) on a screen in front of them, but did so at speeds that left the participant\nclueless to what he or she had actually seen. However, when snake pictures were flashed,\nthese participants started sweating more (i.e., a sign of fear), even though they had no idea\nwhat they\u2019d just viewed!\nYet just because our brains perceive these stimuli without our conscious awareness, do they\nreally affect our subsequent thoughts and behaviors? In a landmark study, Bargh, Chen, and\nBurrows (1996) had participants solve a word search puzzle where the answers pertained to\nwords about the elderly (e.g., \u201cold,\u201d \u201cgrandma\u201d) or something random (e.g., \u201cnotebook,\u201d\n\u201ctomato\u201d). Afterward, the researchers secretly measured how fast the participants walked\ndown the hallway exiting the experiment. And although none of the participants were aware\nof a theme to the answers, those who had solved a puzzle with elderly words (vs. those random\nones) walked more slowly down the hallway!\nThis effect called priming (i.e., readily \u201cactivating\u201d certain concepts and associations from one\u2019s\nmemory) has been replicated in a number of other studies. For example, priming the people\nby having them drink from a warm glass (vs. a cold one) resulted in behaving more \u201cwarmly\u201d\ntoward others (Williams & Bargh, 2008). Although all of these influences occur beneath one\u2019s States of Consciousness 135\nconscious awareness, they still have a\nsignificant effect on one\u2019s subsequent\nthoughts and behaviors.\nIn the last two decades researchers have\nmade advances in studying aspects of\npsychology that exist beyond conscious\nawareness. As you can understand, it is\ndifficult to use self-reports and surveys to\nask people about motives or beliefs that\nthey, themselves, might not even be aware\nof! One way of side-stepping this difficulty\ncan be found in the implicit associations\ntest, or IAT (Greenwald, McGhee &\nSchwartz, 1998). This research method uses\ncomputers to assess people\u2019s reaction times\nto various stimuli and is a very difficult test\nto fake because it records automatic reactions that occur in milliseconds. For instance, to shed\nlight on deeply held biases, the IAT might present photographs of Caucasian faces and Asian\nfaces while asking research participants to click buttons indicating either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d as\nquickly as possible. This method can help uncover non-conscious biases as well as those that\nwe are motivated to suppress. Even if the participant clicks \u201cgood\u201d for every face shown, the\nIAT can still pick up minute delays in responding. Delays are associated with more mental\neffort needed to process information. When information is processed quickly\u2014as in the\nexample of white faces being judged as \u201cgood\u201d\u2014it can be contrasted with slower processing\n\u2014as in the example of Asian faces being judged as \u201cgood\u201d\u2014and the difference in processing\nspeed is reflective of bias. In this regard, the IAT has been used for investigating stereotypes\n(Nosek, Banaji & Greenwald, 2002) as well as self-esteem (Greenwald & Farnam, 2000).\nHigh Awareness\nJust because we may be influenced by these \u201cinvisible\u201d factors, it doesn\u2019t mean we are\nhelplessly controlled by them. The other side of the awareness continuum is known as \u201chigh\nawareness.\u201d This is what you think of as effortful attention and decision making. For example,\nwhen you listen to a funny story on a date, consider which class schedule would be preferable,\nor complete a complex math problem, you are engaging a state of consciousness that allows\nyou to be highly aware of and focused on particular details in your environment. States of Consciousness 136\nAn actual screenshot from an IAT (Implicit Association Test) that a person might\ntake to test their own mental representations of various cognitive constructs.\nIn this particular case, this is an item testing an individual\u2019s unconscious reaction\ntowards members of various ethnic groups. [Image: Courtesy of Anthony\nGreenwald from Project Implicit]\nMindfulness is a state of this heightened conscious awareness of the thoughts passing\nthrough one\u2019s head. For example, have you ever snapped at someone in frustration, only to\ntake a moment and reflect on why you responded so aggressively? This more effortful\nconsideration of your thoughts could be described as an expansion of your conscious\nawareness as you take the time to consider the possible influences on your thoughts. Research\nhas shown that when you engage in this more deliberate consideration, you are less persuaded\nby irrelevant yet biasing influences, like the presence of a celebrity in an advertisement (Petty\n& Cacioppo, 1986). Higher awareness is also associated with recognizing when you\u2019re using\na stereotype, rather than fairly evaluating another person (Gilbert & Hixon, 1991).\nConstantly, we\u2019re alternating between low and high thinking states: the less we\u2019re paying\nattention, the more likely we\u2019re influenced by non-conscious stimuli (Chaiken, 1980). And\nalthough these subliminal influences may have an effect on us regardless of how effortfully\nwe\u2019re thinking, we can use our higher conscious awareness to blunt or even reverse the effect\nof them. In what\u2019s known as the Flexible Correction Model (Wegener & Petty, 1997), as long\nas people are aware that their thoughts or behavior is being influenced by an undue, outside States of Consciousness 137\nsource, they will correct their attitude against the bias.\nTo help make this relationship between lower and\nhigher conscious thoughts clearer, imagine the brain is\nlike a train terminal and all of our thoughts are the\ndifferent trains you can ride. Sometimes, when you\nhave low awareness, you just jump on the first train that\nopens its doors for you. However, if you\u2019re more mindful\nof your thoughts, you can pause to consider all the\nvarious trains and select the one that will best get you\nto your destination. But this analogy, and all the other\nresearch we\u2019ve discussed, has only applied to your\nstandard conception of consciousness. So what about\nother states\u2014like sleeping, daydreaming, or hypnosis\n\u2014how are these related to our conscious awareness?\nSome people practice meditation. This has\nOther States of Consciousness\nbeen linked to lower stress and higher well-\nbeing. [Image: Paul Vallejo]\nHypnosis\nIf you\u2019ve ever watched a stage\nhypnotist perform, it may paint a\nmisleading portrait of this state of\nconsciousness. The hypnotized people\non stage, for example, appear to be in\na state similar to sleep. However, as\nthe hypnotist continues with the\nshow, you would recognize some\nprofound differences between sleep\nand hypnosis. Namely, when you\u2019re\nasleep, hearing the word \u201cstrawberry\u201d\ndoesn\u2019t make you flap your arms like\nPeople being hypnotized on stage. [Image: New Media Expo]\na chicken. In stage performances, the\nhypnotized participants appear to be highly suggestible, to the point that they are seemingly\nunder the hypnotist\u2019s control. Such performances are entertaining but have a way of\nsensationalizing the true nature of hypnotic states.\nHypnosis is an actual, documented phenomenon\u2014one that has been studied and debated States of Consciousness 138\nTable 1: States of Consciousness.\nfor over 200 years (Pekala et al., 2010). Franz Mesmer (1734 \u2013 1815) is often credited as among\nthe first people to \u201cdiscover\u201d hypnosis, which he used to treat members of elite society who\nwere experiencing psychological distress. It is from Mesmer\u2019s name that we get the English\nword, \u201cmesmerize\u201d meaning \u201cto entrance or transfix a person\u2019s attention.\u201d Mesmer attributed\nthe effect of hypnosis to \u201canimal magnetism,\u201d a supposed universal force (similar to gravity)\nthat operates through all human bodies. Even at the time, such an account of hypnosis was\nnot scientifically supported, and Mesmer himself was frequently the center of controversy.\nOver the years, researchers have proposed that hypnosis is a mental state characterized by\nreduced peripheral awareness and increased focus on a singular stimulus, which results in\nan enhanced susceptibility to suggestion (Kihlstrom, 2003). For example, the hypnotist will\nusually induce hypnosis by getting the person to pay attention only to the hypnotist\u2019s voice.\nAs the individual focuses more and more on that, s/he begins to forget the context of the\nsetting and responds to the hypnotist\u2019s suggestions as if they were his or her own. Some\npeople are naturally more suggestible, and therefore more \u201chypnotizable\u201d than are others,\nand this is especially true for those who score high in empathy (Wickramasekera II & Szlyk,\n2003). One common \u201ctrick\u201d of stage hypnotists is to discard volunteers who are less suggestible\nthan others. Regardless of one\u2019s predisposition to being hypnotized, this mental state relies\non two psychological processes: a dissociation of the self, and reduction in elaborative (or\n\u201ccritical\u201d) thinking (Aguado, 2015).\nDissociation is the separation of one\u2019s awareness from everything besides what one is\ncentrally focused on. For example, if you\u2019ve ever been daydreaming in class, you were likely\nso caught up in the fantasy that you didn\u2019t hear a word the teacher said. During hypnosis, this\ndissociation becomes even more extreme. That is, a person concentrates so much on the\nwords of the hypnotist that s/he loses perspective of the rest of the world around them. As a\nconsequence of dissociation, a person is less effortful, and less self-conscious in consideration\nof his or her own thoughts and behaviors. Similar to low awareness states, where one often\nacts on the first thought that comes to mind, so, too, in hypnosis does the individual simply\nfollow the first thought that comes to mind, i.e., the hypnotist\u2019s suggestion. Still, just because States of Consciousness 139\none is more susceptible to suggestion under hypnosis, it doesn\u2019t mean s/he will do anything\nthat\u2019s ordered. To be hypnotized, you must first want to be hypnotized (i.e., you can\u2019t be\nhypnotized against your will; Lynn & Kirsh, 2006), and once you are hypnotized, you won\u2019t do\nanything you wouldn\u2019t also do while in a more natural state of consciousness (Lynn, Rhue, &\nWeekes, 1990).\nToday, hypnotherapy is still used in a variety of formats, and it has evolved from Mesmer\u2019s\nearly tinkering with the concept. Modern hypnotherapy often uses a combination of relaxation,\nsuggestion, motivation and expectancies to create a desired mental or behavioral state.\nAlthough there is mixed evidence on whether hypnotherapy can help with addiction reduction\n(e.g., quitting smoking; Abbot et al., 1998) there is some evidence that it can be successful in\ntreating sufferers of acute and chronic pain (Ewin, 1978; Syrjala et al., 1992). For example, one\nstudy examined the treatment of burn patients with either hypnotherapy, pseudo-hypnosis\n(i.e., a placebo condition), or no treatment at all. Afterward, even though people in the placebo\ncondition experienced a 16% decrease in pain, those in the actual hypnosis condition\nexperienced a reduction of nearly 50% (Patterson et al., 1996). Thus, even though hypnosis\nmay be sensationalized for television and movies, its ability to disassociate a person from\ntheir environment (or their pain) in conjunction with increased suggestibility to a clinician\u2019s\nrecommendations (e.g., \u201cyou will feel less anxiety about your chronic pain\u201d) is a documented\npractice with actual medical benefits.\nNow, similar to hypnotic states, trance states also involve a dissociation of the self; however,\npeople in a trance state are said to have less voluntary control over their behaviors and actions.\nTrance states often occur in religious ceremonies, where the person believes he or she is\n\u201cpossessed\u201d by an otherworldly being or force. While in trance, people report anecdotal\naccounts of a \u201chigher consciousness\u201d or communion with a greater power. However, the body\nof research investigating this phenomenon tends to reject the claim that these experiences\nconstitute an \u201caltered state of consciousness.\u201d\nMost researchers today describe both hypnosis and trance states as \u201csubjective\u201d alterations\nof consciousness, not an actually distinct or evolved form (Kirsch & Lynn, 1995). Just like you\nfeel different when you\u2019re in a state of deep relaxation, so, too, are hypnotic and trance states\nsimply shifts from the standard conscious experience. Researchers contend that even though\nboth hypnotic and trance states appear and feel wildly different than the normal human\nexperience, they can be explained by standard socio-cognitive factors like imagination,\nexpectation, and the interpretation of the situation.\nSleep States of Consciousness 140\nYou may have experienced the\nsensation, as you are falling asleep,\nof falling and then found yourself\njerking forward and grabbing out\nas if you were really falling. Sleep is\na unique state of consciousness.\nPeople generally follow a \u201cbiological\nclock\u201d that impacts when they\nnaturally become drowsy, when\nthey fall asleep, and the time they\nnaturally awaken. The hormone\nmelatonin increases at night and Sleep is necessary in order for people to function well [Image:\nis associated with becoming RelaxingMusic]\nsleepy. Your natural daily rhythm,\nor Circadian Rhythm, can be influenced by the amount of daylight to which you are exposed\nas well as your work and activity schedule. Changing your location, such as flying from Canada\nto England, can disrupt your natural sleep rhythms, and we call this jet lag. You can overcome\njet lag by synchronizing yourself to the local schedule by exposing yourself to daylight and\nforcing yourself to stay awake even though you are naturally sleepy.\nInterestingly, sleep itself is more than shutting off for the night (or for a nap). Instead of turning\noff like a light with a flick of a switch, your shift in consciousness is reflected in your brain\u2019s\nelectrical activity. While you are awake and alert your brain activity is marked by beta waves.\nBeta waves are characterized by being high in frequency but low in intensity. In addition, they\nare the most inconsistent brain wave and this reflects the wide variation in sensory input that\na person processes during the day. As you begin to relax these change to alpha waves. These\nwaves reflect brain activity that is less frequent, more consistent and more intense. As you\nslip into actual sleep you transition through 5 stages of sleep, each characterized by its own\nunique pattern of brain activity:\n\u2022 Stage 1: is a light sleep and is marked by theta waves\n\u2022 Stage 2: is deeper sleep (here there are \u201csleep spindles,\u201d or occasional very high intensity\nbrain waves).\n\u2022 Stage 3: is marked by greater muscle relaxation and the appearance of delta waves\n\u2022 Stage 4: is very relaxed and marked by delta waves\n\u2022 Stage 5: sleep marked by rapid eye movement (REM). It is here that people dream most\nvividly. Interestingly, this stage is\u2014where brain activity is concerned\u2014similar to States of Consciousness 141\nwakefulness. That is, the brain waves occur less intensely than in other stages of sleep.\nDreams are, arguably, the most interesting\naspect of sleep. Throughout history dreams\nhave been given special importance\nbecause of their unique, almost mystical\nnature. They have been thought to be\npredictions of the future, hints of hidden\naspects of the self, important lessons about\nhow to live life, or opportunities to engage\nin impossible deeds like flying. There are\nseveral competing theories of why humans\ndream. One is that it is our nonconscious\nattempt to make sense of our daily\nexperiences and learning. Another, popularized\nFigure 1. Changes in brain activity or brainwaves across different by Freud, is that dreams represent taboo or\nstages of consciousness \u2013 from being awake and throughout\ntroublesome wishes or desires. Regardless\nvarious stages of sleep. [Image: OpenStax]\nof the specific reason we know a few facts\nabout dreams: all humans dream, we dream at every stage of sleep, but dreams during REM\nsleep are especially vivid. One under explored area of dream research is the possible social\nfunctions of dreams: we often share our dreams with others and use them for entertainment\nvalue.\nSleep serves many functions, one of which is to give us a period of mental and physical\nrestoration. Children generally need more sleep than adults since they are developing. It is\nso vital, in fact, that a lack of sleep is associated with a wide range of problems. People who\ndo not receive adequate sleep are more irritable, have slower reaction time, have more\ndifficulty sustaining attention, and make poorer decisions. Interestingly, this is an issue\nrelevant to the lives of college students. In one highly cited study researchers found that 1 in\n5 students took more than 30 minutes to fall asleep at night, 1 in 10 occasionally took sleep\nmedications, and more than half reported being \u201cmostly tired\u201d in the mornings (Buboltz, et\nal, 2001).\nPsychoactive Drugs\nOn April 16, 1943, Albert Hoffman\u2014a Swiss chemist working in a pharmaceutical company\u2014\naccidentally ingested a newly synthesized drug. The drug\u2014lysergic acid diethylimide (LSD)\u2014\nturned out to be a powerful hallucinogen. Hoffman went home and later reported the effects States of Consciousness 142\nof the drug, describing them as seeing the world through a \u201cwarped mirror\u201d and experiencing\nvisions of \u201cextraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors.\u201d Hoffman had\ndiscovered what members of many traditional cultures around the world already knew: there\nare substances that, when ingested, can have a powerful effect on perception and on\nconsciousness.\nDrugs operate on human physiology in a variety of ways and researchers and medical doctors\ntend to classify drugs according to their effects. Here we will briefly cover 3 categories of drugs:\nhallucinogens, depressants, and stimulants.\nHallucinogens\nIt is possible that hallucinogens are the substance that have, historically, been used the most\nwidely. Traditional societies have used plant-based hallucinogens such as peyote, ebene, and\npsilocybin mushrooms in a wide range of religious ceremonies. Hallucinogens are substances\nthat alter a person\u2019s perceptions, often by creating visions or hallucinations that are not real.\nThere are a wide range of hallucinogens and many are used as recreational substances in\nindustrialized societies. Common examples include marijuana, LSD, and MDMA, also known\nas \u201cecstasy.\u201d Marijuana is the dried flowers of the hemp plant and is often smoked to produce\neuphoria. The active ingredient in marijuana is called THC and can produce distortions in the\nperception of time, can create a sense of rambling, unrelated thoughts, and is sometimes\nassociated with increased hunger or excessive laughter. The use and possession of marijuana\nis illegal in most places but this appears to be a trend that is changing. Uruguay, Bangladesh,\nseveral of the United States, and a few other countries have recently legalized marijuana. This\nmay be due, in part, to changing public attitudes or to the fact that marijuana is increasingly\nused for medical purposes such as the management of nausea or treating glaucoma.\nDepressants\nDepressants are substances that, as their name suggests, slow down the body\u2019s physiology\nand mental processes. Alcohol is the most widely used depressant. Alcohol\u2019s effects include\nthe reduction of inhibition, meaning that intoxicated people are more likely to act in ways they\nwould otherwise be reluctant to. Alcohol\u2019s psychological effects are the result of it increasing\nthe neurotransmitter GABA. There are also physical effects, such as loss of balance and\ncoordination, and these stem from the way that alcohol interferes with the coordination of\nthe visual and motor systems of the brain. Despite the fact that alcohol is so widely accepted\nin many cultures it is also associated with a variety of dangers. First, alcohol is toxic, meaning\nthat it acts like a poison because it is possible to drink more alcohol than the body can States of Consciousness 143\neffectively remove from the bloodstream. When a person\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAC)\nreaches .3 to .4% there is a serious risk of death. Second, the lack of judgment and physical\ncontrol associated with alcohol is associated with more risk taking behavior or dangerous\nbehavior such as drunk driving. Finally, alcohol is addictive and heavy drinkers often\nexperience significant interference with their ability to work effectively or in their close\nrelationships.\nOther common depressants include opiates (also called \u201cnarcotics\u201d), which are substances\nsynthesized from the poppy flower. Opiates stimulate endorphins production in the brain\nand because of this they are often used as pain killers by medical professionals. Unfortunately,\nbecause opiates such as Oxycontin so reliably produce euphoria they are increasingly used\n\u2014illegally\u2014as recreational substances. Opiates are highly addictive.\nStimulants\nStimulants are substances that \u201cspeed up\u201d\nthe body\u2019s physiological and mental\nprocesses. Two commonly used stimulants\nare caffeine\u2014the drug found in coffee and\ntea\u2014and nicotine, the active drug in\ncigarettes and other tobacco products.\nThese substances are both legal and\nrelatively inexpensive, leading to their\nwidespread use. Many people are\nattracted to stimulants because they feel\nmore alert when under the influence of\nthese drugs. As with any drug there are\nhealth risks associated with consumption.\nFor example, over intoxication of these\ntypes of stimulants can result in anxiety,\nheadaches, and insomnia. Similarly, Caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant in the world. Be\nhonest, how many cups did you have today? [Image:\nsmoking cigarettes\u2014the most common\nPersoneelsnet]\nmeans of ingesting nicotine\u2014is associated\nwith higher risks of cancer. For instance, among heavy smokers 90% of lung cancer is directly\nattributable to smoking (Stewart & Kleihues, 2003).\nThere are other stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine (also known as \u201ccrystal\nmeth\u201d or \u201cice\u201d) that are illegal substances that are commonly used. These substances act by States of Consciousness 144\nblocking \u201cre-uptake\u201d of dopamine in the brain. This means that the brain does not naturally\nclear out the dopamine and that it builds up in the synapse, creating euphoria and alertness.\nAs the effects wear off it stimulates strong cravings for more of the drug. Because of this these\npowerful stimulants are highly addictive.\nConclusion\nWhen you think about your daily life it is easy to get lulled into the belief that there is one\n\u201csetting\u201d for your conscious thought. That is, you likely believe that you hold the same opinions,\nvalues, and memories across the day and throughout the week. But \u201cyou\u201d are like a dimmer\nswitch on a light that can be turned from full darkness increasingly on up to full brightness.\nThis switch is consciousness. At your brightest setting you are fully alert and aware; at dimmer\nsettings you are day dreaming; and sleep or being knocked unconscious represent dimmer\nsettings still. The degree to which you are in high, medium, or low states of conscious\nawareness affect how susceptible you are to persuasion, how clear your judgment is, and how\nmuch detail you can recall. Understanding levels of awareness, then, is at the heart of\nunderstanding how we learn, decide, remember and many other vital psychological processes.

McDermott & Henry L. Roediger\n\u201cMemory\u201d is a single term that reflects a number of different abilities: holding information\nbriefly while working with it (working memory), remembering episodes of one\u2019s life (episodic\nmemory), and our general knowledge of facts of the world (semantic memory), among other\ntypes. Remembering episodes involves three processes: encoding information (learning it, by\nperceiving it and relating it to past knowledge), storing it (maintaining it over time), and then\nretrieving it (accessing the information when needed). Failures can occur at any stage, leading\nto forgetting or to having false memories. The key to improving one\u2019s memory is to improve\nprocesses of encoding and to use techniques that guarantee effective retrieval. Good encoding\ntechniques include relating new information to what one already knows, forming mental\nimages, and creating associations among information that needs to be remembered. The key\nto good retrieval is developing effective cues that will lead the rememberer back to the encoded\ninformation. Classic mnemonic systems, known since the time of the ancient Greeks and still\nused by some today, can greatly improve one\u2019s memory abilities.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Define and note differences between the following forms of memory: working memory,\nepisodic memory, semantic memory, collective memory.\n\u2022 Describe the three stages in the process of learning and remembering.\n\u2022 Describe strategies that can be used to enhance the original learning or encoding of\ninformation.\n\u2022 Describe strategies that can improve the process of retrieval.\n\u2022 Describe why the classic mnemonic device, the method of loci, works so well. Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 154\nIntroduction\nIn 2013, Simon Reinhard sat in front of 60 people in a room at Washington University, where\nhe memorized an increasingly long series of digits. On the first round, a computer generated\n10 random digits\u20146 1 9 4 8 5 6 3 7 1\u2014on a screen for 10 seconds. After the series disappeared,\nSimon typed them into his computer. His recollection was perfect. In the next phase, 20 digits\nappeared on the screen for 20 seconds. Again, Simon got them all correct. No one in the\naudience (mostly professors, graduate students, and undergraduate students) could recall\nthe 20 digits perfectly. Then came 30 digits, studied for 30 seconds; once again, Simon didn\u2019t\nmisplace even a single digit. For a final trial, 50 digits appeared on the screen for 50 seconds,\nand again, Simon got them all right. In fact, Simon would have been happy to keep going. His\nrecord in this task\u2014called \u201cforward digit span\u201d\u2014is 240 digits!\nWhen most of us witness a\nperformance like that of Simon\nReinhard, we think one of two things:\nFirst, maybe he\u2019s cheating somehow.\n(No, he is not.) Second, Simon must\nhave abilities more advanced than the\nrest of humankind. After all, psychologists\nestablished many years ago that the\nnormal memory span for adults is\nabout 7 digits, with some of us able to\nrecall a few more and others a few less\nIn some ways memory is like file drawers where you store mental (Miller, 1956). That is why the first\ninformation. Memory is also a series of processes: how does that phone numbers were limited to 7\ninformation get filed to begin with and how does it get retrieved when\ndigits\u2014psychologists determined that\nneeded? [Photo: Jason Carpenter]\nmany errors occurred (costing the\nphone company money) when the\nnumber was increased to even 8 digits. But in normal testing, no one gets 50 digits correct in\na row, much less 240. So, does Simon Reinhard simply have a photographic memory? He does\nnot. Instead, Simon has taught himself simple strategies for remembering that have greatly\nincreased his capacity for remembering virtually any type of material\u2014digits, words, faces\nand names, poetry, historical dates, and so on. Twelve years earlier, before he started training\nhis memory abilities, he had a digit span of 7, just like most of us. Simon has been training\nhis abilities for about 10 years as of this writing, and has risen to be in the top two of \u201cmemory\nathletes.\u201d In 2012, he came in second place in the World Memory Championships (composed\nof 11 tasks), held in London. He currently ranks second in the world, behind another German Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 155\ncompetitor, Johannes Mallow. In this module, we reveal what psychologists and others have\nlearned about memory, and we also explain the general principles by which you can improve\nyour own memory for factual material.\nVarieties of Memory\nFor most of us, remembering digits\nrelies on short-term memory, or working\nmemory\u2014the ability to hold information\nin our minds for a brief time and work\nwith it (e.g., multiplying 24 x 17 without\nusing paper would rely on working\nmemory). Another type of memory is\nepisodic memory\u2014the ability to remember\nthe episodes of our lives. If you were\ngiven the task of recalling everything you\ndid 2 days ago, that would be a test of\nepisodic memory; you would be\nTo be a good chess player you have to learn to increase working required to mentally travel through the\nmemory so you can plan ahead for several offensive moves while day in your mind and note the main\nsimultaneously anticipating - through use of memory - how the other events. Semantic memory is our\nplayer could counter each of your planned moves. [Photo: D-Stanley] storehouse of more-or-less permanent\nknowledge, such as the meanings of\nwords in a language (e.g., the meaning of \u201cparasol\u201d) and the huge collection of facts about the\nworld (e.g., there are 196 countries in the world, and 206 bones in your body). Collective memory\nrefers to the kind of memory that people in a group share (whether family, community,\nschoolmates, or citizens of a state or a country). For example, residents of small towns often\nstrongly identify with those towns, remembering the local customs and historical events in a\nunique way. That is, the community\u2019s collective memory passes stories and recollections\nbetween neighbors and to future generations, forming a memory system unto itself.\nPsychologists continue to debate the classification of types of memory, as well as which types\nrely on others (Tulving, 2007), but for this module we will focus on episodic memory. Episodic\nmemory is usually what people think of when they hear the word \u201cmemory.\u201d For example,\nwhen people say that an older relative is \u201closing her memory\u201d due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the\ntype of memory-loss they are referring to is the inability to recall events, or episodic memory.\n(Semantic memory is actually preserved in early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease.) Although\nremembering specific events that have happened over the course of one\u2019s entire life (e.g., Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 156\nyour experiences in sixth grade) can be referred to as autobiographical memory, we will focus\nprimarily on the episodic memories of more recent events.\nThree Stages of the Learning/Memory Process\nPsychologists distinguish between three necessary stages in the learning and memory\nprocess: encoding, storage, and retrieval (Melton, 1963). Encoding is defined as the initial\nlearning of information; storage refers to maintaining information over time; retrieval is the\nability to access information when you need it. If you meet someone for the first time at a\nparty, you need to encode her name (Lyn Goff) while you associate her name with her face.\nThen you need to maintain the information over time. If you see her a week later, you need\nto recognize her face and have it serve as a cue to retrieve her name. Any successful act of\nremembering requires that all three stages be intact. However, two types of errors can also\noccur. Forgetting is one type: you see the person you met at the party and you cannot recall\nher name. The other error is misremembering (false recall or false recognition): you see\nsomeone who looks like Lyn Goff and call the person by that name (false recognition of the\nface). Or, you might see the real Lyn Goff, recognize her face, but then call her by the name\nof another woman you met at the party (misrecall of her name).\nWhenever forgetting or misremembering occurs, we can ask, at which stage in the learning/\nmemory process was there a failure?\u2014though it is often difficult to answer this question with\nprecision. One reason for this inaccuracy is that the three stages are not as discrete as our\ndescription implies. Rather, all three stages depend on one another. How we encode\ninformation determines how it will be stored and what cues will be effective when we try to\nretrieve it. And too, the act of retrieval itself also changes the way information is subsequently\nremembered, usually aiding later recall of the retrieved information. The central point for now\nis that the three stages\u2014encoding, storage, and retrieval\u2014affect one another, and are\ninextricably bound together.\nEncoding\nEncoding refers to the initial experience of perceiving and learning information. Psychologists\noften study recall by having participants study a list of pictures or words. Encoding in these\nsituations is fairly straightforward. However, \u201creal life\u201d encoding is much more challenging.\nWhen you walk across campus, for example, you encounter countless sights and sounds\u2014\nfriends passing by, people playing Frisbee, music in the air. The physical and mental\nenvironments are much too rich for you to encode all the happenings around you or the\ninternal thoughts you have in response to them. So, an important first principle of encoding Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 157\nis that it is selective: we attend to some events in our environment and we ignore others. A\nsecond point about encoding is that it is prolific; we are always encoding the events of our\nlives\u2014attending to the world, trying to understand it. Normally this presents no problem, as\nour days are filled with routine occurrences, so we don\u2019t need to pay attention to everything.\nBut if something does happen that seems strange\u2014during your daily walk across campus,\nyou see a giraffe\u2014then we pay close attention and try to understand why we are seeing what\nwe are seeing.\nRight after your typical walk across campus\n(one without the appearance of a giraffe), you\nwould be able to remember the events\nreasonably well if you were asked. You could\nsay whom you bumped into, what song was\nplaying from a radio, and so on. However,\nsuppose someone asked you to recall the same\nwalk a month later. You wouldn\u2019t stand a\nchance. You would likely be able to recount the\nbasics of a typical walk across campus, but not\nthe precise details of that particular walk. Yet,\nif you had seen a giraffe during that walk, the\nevent would have been fixed in your mind for\na long time, probably for the rest of your life.\nYou would tell your friends about it, and, on\nlater occasions when you saw a giraffe, you\nmight be reminded of the day you saw one on\ncampus. Psychologists have long pinpointed\ndistinctiveness\u2014having an event stand out as\nquite different from a background of similar\nA giraffe in the context of a zoo or its natural habitat may\nevents\u2014as a key to remembering events (Hunt,\nregister as nothing more than ordinary, but put it in another\n2003).\nsetting - in the middle of a campus or a busy city - and its\nlevel of distinctiveness increases dramatically. Distinctiveness\nIn addition, when vivid memories are tinged is a key attribute to remembering events. [Image: David\nwith strong emotional content, they often Blackwell]\nseem to leave a permanent mark on us. Public\ntragedies, such as terrorist attacks, often create vivid memories in those who witnessed them.\nBut even those of us not directly involved in such events may have vivid memories of them,\nincluding memories of first hearing about them. For example, many people are able to recall\ntheir exact physical location when they first learned about the assassination or accidental\ndeath of a national figure. The term flashbulb memory was originally coined by Brown and Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 158\nKulik (1977) to describe this sort of vivid memory of finding out an important piece of news.\nThe name refers to how some memories seem to be captured in the mind like a flash\nphotograph; because of the distinctiveness and emotionality of the news, they seem to\nbecome permanently etched in the mind with exceptional clarity compared to other\nmemories.\nTake a moment and think back on your own life. Is there a particular memory that seems\nsharper than others? A memory where you can recall unusual details, like the colors of\nmundane things around you, or the exact positions of surrounding objects? Although people\nhave great confidence in flashbulb memories like these, the truth is, our objective accuracy\nwith them is far from perfect (Talarico & Rubin, 2003). That is, even though people may have\ngreat confidence in what they recall, their memories are not as accurate (e.g., what the actual\ncolors were; where objects were truly placed) as they tend to imagine. Nonetheless, all other\nthings being equal, distinctive and emotional events are well-remembered.\nDetails do not leap perfectly from the world into a person\u2019s mind. We might say that we went\nto a party and remember it, but what we remember is (at best) what we encoded. As noted\nabove, the process of encoding is selective, and in complex situations, relatively few of many\npossible details are noticed and encoded. The process of encoding always involves recoding\n\u2014that is, taking the information from the form it is delivered to us and then converting it in\na way that we can make sense of it. For example, you might try to remember the colors of a\nrainbow by using the acronym ROY G BIV (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). The\nprocess of recoding the colors into a name can help us to remember. However, recoding can\nalso introduce errors\u2014when we accidentally add\ninformation during encoding, then remember that\nnew material as if it had been part of the actual\nexperience (as discussed below).\nPsychologists have studied many recoding\nstrategies that can be used during study to improve\nretention. First, research advises that, as we study,\nwe should think of the meaning of the events (Craik\n& Lockhart, 1972), and we should try to relate new\nevents to information we already know. This helps\nus form associations that we can use to retrieve\ninformation later. Second, imagining events also\nmakes them more memorable; creating vivid\nAlthough it requires more effort, using images and\nassociations can improve the process of recoding. images out of information (even verbal\n[Image: Leo Reynolds] information) can greatly improve later recall (Bower Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 159\n& Reitman, 1972). Creating imagery is part of the technique Simon Reinhard uses to remember\nhuge numbers of digits, but we can all use images to encode information more effectively.\nThe basic concept behind good encoding strategies is to form distinctive memories (ones that\nstand out), and to form links or associations among memories to help later retrieval (Hunt &\nMcDaniel, 1993). Using study strategies such as the ones described here is challenging, but\nthe effort is well worth the benefits of enhanced learning and retention.\nWe emphasized earlier that encoding is selective: people cannot encode all information they\nare exposed to. However, recoding can add information that was not even seen or heard\nduring the initial encoding phase. Several of the recoding processes, like forming associations\nbetween memories, can happen without our awareness. This is one reason people can\nsometimes remember events that did not actually happen\u2014because during the process of\nrecoding, details got added. One common way of inducing false memories in the laboratory\nemploys a word-list technique (Deese, 1959; Roediger & McDermott, 1995). Participants hear\nlists of 15 words, like door, glass, pane, shade, ledge, sill, house, open, curtain, frame, view, breeze,\nsash, screen, and shutter. Later, participants are given a test in which they are shown a list of\nwords and asked to pick out the ones they\u2019d heard earlier. This second list contains some\nwords from the first list (e.g., door, pane, frame) and some words not from the list (e.g., arm,\nphone, bottle). In this example, one of the words on the test is window, which\u2014importantly\u2014\ndoes not appear in the first list, but which is related to other words in that list. When subjects\nwere tested, they were reasonably accurate with the studied words (door, etc.), recognizing\nthem 72% of the time. However, when window was on the test, they falsely recognized it as\nhaving been on the list 84% of the time (Stadler, Roediger, & McDermott, 1999). The same\nthing happened with many other lists the authors used. This phenomenon is referred to as\nthe DRM (for Deese-Roediger-McDermott) effect. One explanation for such results is that,\nwhile students listened to items in the list, the words triggered the students to think about\nwindow, even though window was never presented. In this way, people seem to encode events\nthat are not actually part of their experience.\nBecause humans are creative, we are always going beyond the information we are given: we\nautomatically make associations and infer from them what is happening. But, as with the\nword association mix-up above, sometimes we make false memories from our inferences\u2014\nremembering the inferences themselves as if they were actual experiences. To illustrate this,\nBrewer (1977) gave people sentences to remember that were designed to elicit pragmatic\ninferences. Inferences, in general, refer to instances when something is not explicitly stated,\nbut we are still able to guess the undisclosed intention. For example, if your friend told you\nthat she didn\u2019t want to go out to eat, you may infer that she doesn\u2019t have the money to go\nout, or that she\u2019s too tired. With pragmatic inferences, there is usually one particular inference\nyou\u2019re likely to make. Consider the statement Brewer (1977) gave her participants: \u201cThe karate Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 160\nchampion hit the cinder block.\u201d After hearing or seeing this sentence, participants who were\ngiven a memory test tended to remember the statement as having been, \u201cThe karate champion\nbroke the cinder block.\u201d This remembered statement is not necessarily a logical inference (i.\ne., it is perfectly reasonable that a karate champion could hit a cinder block without breaking\nit). Nevertheless, the pragmatic conclusion from hearing such a sentence is that the block was\nlikely broken. The participants remembered this inference they made while hearing the\nsentence in place of the actual words that were in the sentence (see also McDermott & Chan,\n2006).\nEncoding\u2014the initial registration of information\u2014is essential in the learning and memory\nprocess. Unless an event is encoded in some fashion, it will not be successfully remembered\nlater. However, just because an event is encoded (even if it is encoded well), there\u2019s no\nguarantee that it will be remembered later.\nStorage\nEvery experience we have changes our\nbrains. That may seem like a bold, even\nstrange, claim at first, but it\u2019s true. We encode\neach of our experiences within the structures\nof the nervous system, making new\nimpressions in the process\u2014and each of\nthose impressions involves changes in the\nbrain. Psychologists (and neurobiologists)\nsay that experiences leave memory traces,\nor engrams (the two terms are synonyms).\nMemories have to be stored somewhere in\nthe brain, so in order to do so, the brain\nMemory traces, or engrams, are NOT perfectly preserved\nbiochemically alters itself and its neural\nrecordings of past experiences. The traces are combined with\ntissue. Just like you might write yourself a current knowledge to reconstruct what we think happened in\nnote to remind you of something, the brain the past. [Photo: INDEED]\n\u201cwrites\u201d a memory trace, changing its own\nphysical composition to do so. The basic idea is that events (occurrences in our environment)\ncreate engrams through a process of consolidation: the neural changes that occur after\nlearning to create the memory trace of an experience. Although neurobiologists are concerned\nwith exactly what neural processes change when memories are created, for psychologists,\nthe term memory trace simply refers to the physical change in the nervous system (whatever\nthat may be, exactly) that represents our experience. Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 161\nAlthough the concept of engram or memory trace is extremely useful, we shouldn\u2019t take the\nterm too literally. It is important to understand that memory traces are not perfect little packets\nof information that lie dormant in the brain, waiting to be called forward to give an accurate\nreport of past experience. Memory traces are not like video or audio recordings, capturing\nexperience with great accuracy; as discussed earlier, we often have errors in our memory,\nwhich would not exist if memory traces were perfect packets of information. Thus, it is wrong\nto think that remembering involves simply \u201creading out\u201d a faithful record of past experience.\nRather, when we remember past events, we reconstruct them with the aid of our memory\ntraces\u2014but also with our current belief of what happened. For example, if you were trying to\nrecall for the police who started a fight at a bar, you may not have a memory trace of who\npushed whom first. However, let\u2019s say you remember that one of the guys held the door open\nfor you. When thinking back to the start of the fight, this knowledge (of how one guy was\nfriendly to you) may unconsciously influence your memory of what happened in favor of the\nnice guy. Thus, memory is a construction of what you actually recall and what you believe\nhappened. In a phrase, remembering is reconstructive (we reconstruct our past with the aid\nof memory traces) not reproductive (a perfect reproduction or recreation of the past).\nPsychologists refer to the time between learning and testing as the retention interval.\nMemories can consolidate during that time, aiding retention. However, experiences can also\noccur that undermine the memory. For example, think of what you had for lunch yesterday\n\u2014a pretty easy task. However, if you had to recall what you had for lunch 17 days ago, you\nmay well fail (assuming you don\u2019t eat the same thing every day). The 16 lunches you\u2019ve had\nsince that one have created retroactive interference. Retroactive interference refers to new\nactivities (i.e., the subsequent lunches) during the retention interval (i.e., the time between\nthe lunch 17 days ago and now) that interfere with retrieving the specific, older memory (i.e.,\nthe lunch details from 17 days ago). But just as newer things can interfere with remembering\nolder things, so can the opposite happen. Proactive interference is when past memories\ninterfere with the encoding of new ones. For example, if you have ever studied a second\nlanguage, often times the grammar and vocabulary of your native language will pop into your\nhead, impairing your fluency in the foreign language. Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 162\nRetroactive interference is one of the main causes of forgetting (McGeoch, 1932). In the module\nEyewitness Testimony and Memory Biases (http://noba.to/uy49tm37), Elizabeth Loftus\ndescribes her fascinating work on eyewitness memory, in which she shows how memory for\nan event can be changed via misinformation supplied during the retention interval. For\nexample, if you witnessed a car crash but subsequently heard people describing it from their\nown perspective, this new information may interfere with or disrupt your own personal\nrecollection of the crash. In fact, you may even come to remember the event happening exactly\nas the others described it! This misinformation effect in eyewitness memory represents a\ntype of retroactive interference that can occur during the retention interval (see Loftus [2005]\nfor a review). Of course, if correct information is given during the retention interval, the\nwitness\u2019s memory will usually be improved.\nAlthough interference may arise between the occurrence of an event and the attempt to recall\nit, the effect itself is always expressed when we retrieve memories, the topic to which we turn next.\nRetrieval\nEndel Tulving argued that \u201cthe key process in memory is retrieval\u201d (1991, p. 91). Why should\nretrieval be given more prominence than encoding or storage? For one thing, if information\nwere encoded and stored but could not be retrieved, it would be useless. As discussed\npreviously in this module, we encode and store thousands of events\u2014conversations, sights\nand sounds\u2014every day, creating memory traces. However, we later access only a tiny portion\nof what we\u2019ve taken in. Most of our memories will never be used\u2014in the sense of being brought\nback to mind, consciously. This fact seems so obvious that we rarely reflect on it. All those\nevents that happened to you in the fourth grade that seemed so important then? Now, many\nyears later, you would struggle to remember even a few. You may wonder if the traces of\nthose memories still exist in some latent form. Unfortunately, with currently available\nmethods, it is impossible to know.\nPsychologists distinguish information that is available in memory from that which is accessible\n(Tulving & Pearlstone, 1966). Available information is the information that is stored in memory\n\u2014but precisely how much and what types are stored cannot be known. That is, all we can\nknow is what information we can retrieve\u2014accessible information. The assumption is that\naccessible information represents only a tiny slice of the information available in our brains.\nMost of us have had the experience of trying to remember some fact or event, giving up, and\nthen\u2014all of a sudden!\u2014it comes to us at a later time, even after we\u2019ve stopped trying to\nremember it. Similarly, we all know the experience of failing to recall a fact, but then, if we are\ngiven several choices (as in a multiple-choice test), we are easily able to recognize it. Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 163\nWhat factors determine what information\ncan be retrieved from memory? One\ncritical factor is the type of hints, or\ncues, in the environment. You may\nhear a song on the radio that suddenly\nevokes memories of an earlier time in\nyour life, even if you were not trying to\nremember it when the song came on.\nNevertheless, the song is closely\nassociated with that time, so it brings\nthe experience to mind.\nWe can't know the entirety of what is in our memory, but only that\nportion we can actually retrieve. Something that cannot be retrieved\nThe general principle that underlies\nnow and which is seemingly gone from memory may, with different\nthe effectiveness of retrieval cues is\ncues applied, reemerge. [Photo: sean dreilinger]\nthe encoding specificity principle\n(Tulving & Thomson, 1973): when people encode information, they do so in specific ways. For\nexample, take the song on the radio: perhaps you heard it while you were at a terrific party,\nhaving a great, philosophical conversation with a friend. Thus, the song became part of that\nwhole complex experience. Years later, even though you haven\u2019t thought about that party in\nages, when you hear the song on the radio, the whole experience rushes back to you. In\ngeneral, the encoding specificity principle states that, to the extent a retrieval cue (the song)\nmatches or overlaps the memory trace of an experience (the party, the conversation), it will\nbe effective in evoking the memory. A classic experiment on the encoding specificity principle\nhad participants memorize a set of words in a unique setting. Later, the participants were\ntested on the word sets, either in the same location they learned the words or a different one.\nAs a result of encoding specificity, the students who took the test in the same place they\nlearned the words were actually able to recall more words (Godden & Baddeley, 1975) than\nthe students who took the test in a new setting. In this instance, the physical context itself\nprovided cues for retrieval. This is why it\u2019s good to study for midterms and finals in the same\nroom you\u2019ll be taking them in.\nOne caution with this principle, though, is that, for the cue to work, it can\u2019t match too many\nother experiences (Nairne, 2002; Watkins, 1975). Consider a lab experiment. Suppose you\nstudy 100 items; 99 are words, and one is a picture\u2014of a penguin, item 50 in the list. Afterwards,\nthe cue \u201crecall the picture\u201d would evoke \u201cpenguin\u201d perfectly. No one would miss it. However,\nif the word \u201cpenguin\u201d were placed in the same spot among the other 99 words, its memorability\nwould be exceptionally worse. This outcome shows the power of distinctiveness that we\ndiscussed in the section on encoding: one picture is perfectly recalled from among 99 words\nbecause it stands out. Now consider what would happen if the experiment were repeated, Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 164\nbut there were 25 pictures distributed within the 100-item list. Although the picture of the\npenguin would still be there, the probability that the cue \u201crecall the picture\u201d (at item 50) would\nbe useful for the penguin would drop correspondingly. Watkins (1975) referred to this outcome\nas demonstrating the cue overload principle. That is, to be effective, a retrieval cue cannot\nbe overloaded with too many memories. For the cue \u201crecall the picture\u201d to be effective, it\nshould only match one item in the target set (as in the one-picture, 99-word case).\nTo sum up how memory cues function: for a retrieval cue to be effective, a match must exist\nbetween the cue and the desired target memory; furthermore, to produce the best retrieval,\nthe cue-target relationship should be distinctive. Next, we will see how the encoding specificity\nprinciple can work in practice.\nPsychologists measure memory performance by using production tests (involving recall) or\nrecognition tests (involving the selection of correct from incorrect information, e.g., a multiple-\nchoice test). For example, with our list of 100 words, one group of people might be asked to\nrecall the list in any order (a free recall test), while a different group might be asked to circle\nthe 100 studied words out of a mix with another 100, unstudied words (a recognition test). In\nthis situation, the recognition test would likely produce better performance from participants\nthan the recall test.\nWe usually think of recognition tests as being quite easy, because the cue for retrieval is a\ncopy of the actual event that was presented for study. After all, what could be a better cue\nthan the exact target (memory) the person is trying to access? In most cases, this line of\nreasoning is true; nevertheless, recognition tests do not provide perfect indexes of what is\nstored in memory. That is, you can fail to recognize a target staring you right in the face, yet\nbe able to recall it later with a different set of cues (Watkins & Tulving, 1975). For example,\nsuppose you had the task of recognizing the surnames of famous authors. At first, you might\nthink that being given the actual last name would always be the best cue. However, research\nhas shown this not necessarily to be true (Muter, 1984). When given names such as Tolstoy,\nShaw, Shakespeare, and Lee, subjects might well say that Tolstoy and Shakespeare are famous\nauthors, whereas Shaw and Lee are not. But, when given a cued recall test using first names,\npeople often recall items (produce them) that they had failed to recognize before. For example,\nin this instance, a cue like George Bernard ________ often leads to a recall of \u201cShaw,\u201d even though\npeople initially failed to recognize Shaw as a famous author\u2019s name. Yet, when given the cue\n\u201cWilliam,\u201d people may not come up with Shakespeare, because William is a common name\nthat matches many people (the cue overload principle at work). This strange fact\u2014that recall\ncan sometimes lead to better performance than recognition\u2014can be explained by the\nencoding specificity principle. As a cue, George Bernard _________ matches the way the famous\nwriter is stored in memory better than does his surname, Shaw, does (even though it is the Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 165\ntarget). Further, the match is quite distinctive with George Bernard ___________, but the cue\nWilliam _________________ is much more overloaded (Prince William, William Yeats, William\nFaulkner, will.i.am).\nThe phenomenon we have been describing is called the recognition failure of recallable words,\nwhich highlights the point that a cue will be most effective depending on how the information\nhas been encoded (Tulving & Thomson, 1973). The point is, the cues that work best to evoke\nretrieval are those that recreate the event or name to be remembered, whereas sometimes\neven the target itself, such as Shaw in the above example, is not the best cue. Which cue will\nbe most effective depends on how the information has been encoded.\nWhenever we think about our past, we engage in the act of retrieval. We usually think that\nretrieval is an objective act because we tend to imagine that retrieving a memory is like pulling\na book from a shelf, and after we are done with it, we return the book to the shelf just as it\nwas. However, research shows this assumption to be false; far from being a static repository\nof data, the memory is constantly changing. In fact, every time we retrieve a memory, it is\naltered. For example, the act of retrieval itself (of a fact, concept, or event) makes the retrieved\nmemory much more likely to be retrieved again, a phenomenon called the testing effect or the\nretrieval practice effect (Pyc & Rawson, 2009; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006). However, retrieving\nsome information can actually cause us to forget other information related to it, a\nphenomenon called retrieval-induced forgetting (Anderson, Bjork, & Bjork, 1994). Thus the act\nof retrieval can be a double-edged sword\u2014strengthening the memory just retrieved (usually\nby a large amount) but harming related information (though this effect is often relatively small).\nAs discussed earlier, retrieval of distant memories is reconstructive. We weave the concrete\nbits and pieces of events in with assumptions and preferences to form a coherent story\n(Bartlett, 1932). For example, if during your 10th birthday, your dog got to your cake before\nyou did, you would likely tell that story for years afterward. Say, then, in later years you\nmisremember where the dog actually found the cake, but repeat that error over and over\nduring subsequent retellings of the story. Over time, that inaccuracy would become a basic\nfact of the event in your mind. Just as retrieval practice (repetition) enhances accurate\nmemories, so will it strengthen errors or false memories (McDermott, 2006). Sometimes\nmemories can even be manufactured just from hearing a vivid story. Consider the following\nepisode, recounted by Jean Piaget, the famous developmental psychologist, from his\nchildhood:\nOne of my first memories would date, if it were true, from my second year. I can still see,\nmost clearly, the following scene, in which I believed until I was about 15. I was sitting in\nmy pram . . . when a man tried to kidnap me. I was held in by the strap fastened round Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 166\nme while my nurse bravely tried to stand between me and the thief. She received various\nscratches, and I can still vaguely see those on her face. . . . When I was about 15, my parents\nreceived a letter from my former nurse saying that she had been converted to the Salvation\nArmy. She wanted to confess her past faults, and in particular to return the watch she\nhad been given as a reward on this occasion. She had made up the whole story, faking\nthe scratches. I therefore must have heard, as a child, this story, which my parents believed,\nand projected it into the past in the form of a visual memory. . . . Many real memories are\ndoubtless of the same order. (Norman & Schacter, 1997, pp. 187\u2013188)\nPiaget\u2019s vivid account represents a case of a pure reconstructive memory. He heard the tale\ntold repeatedly, and doubtless told it (and thought about it) himself. The repeated telling\ncemented the events as though they had really happened, just as we are all open to the\npossibility of having \u201cmany real memories ... of the same order.\u201d The fact that one can\nremember precise details (the location, the scratches) does not necessarily indicate that the\nmemory is true, a point that has been confirmed in laboratory studies, too (e.g., Norman &\nSchacter, 1997).\nPutting It All Together: Improving Your Memory\nA central theme of this module has been the\nimportance of the encoding and retrieval\nprocesses, and their interaction. To recap: to\nimprove learning and memory, we need to\nencode information in conjunction with\nexcellent cues that will bring back the\nremembered events when we need them. But\nhow do we do this? Keep in mind the two critical\nprinciples we have discussed: to maximize\nretrieval, we should construct meaningful cues\nthat remind us of the original experience, and\nthose cues should be distinctive and not\nassociated with other memories. These two\nconditions are critical in maximizing cue\nSome people employ tricks to help them improve their\neffectiveness (Nairne, 2002).\nmemories. [Photo: Fl\u043e\u043ed]\nSo, how can these principles be adapted for use in many situations? Let\u2019s go back to how we\nstarted the module, with Simon Reinhard\u2019s ability to memorize huge numbers of digits.\nAlthough it was not obvious, he applied these same general memory principles, but in a more Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 167\ndeliberate way. In fact, all mnemonic devices, or memory aids/tricks, rely on these\nfundamental principles. In a typical case, the person learns a set of cues and then applies\nthese cues to learn and remember information. Consider the set of 20 items below that are\neasy to learn and remember (Bower & Reitman, 1972).\n1. is a gun. 11 is penny-one, hot dog bun.\n2. is a shoe. 12 is penny-two, airplane glue.\n3. is a tree. 13 is penny-three, bumble bee.\n4. is a door. 14 is penny-four, grocery store.\n5. is knives. 15 is penny-five, big beehive.\n6. is sticks. 16 is penny-six, magic tricks.\n7. is oven. 17 is penny-seven, go to heaven.\n8. is plate. 18 is penny-eight, golden gate.\n9. is wine. 19 is penny-nine, ball of twine.\n10. is hen. 20 is penny-ten, ballpoint pen.\nIt would probably take you less than 10 minutes to learn this list and practice recalling it several\ntimes (remember to use retrieval practice!). If you were to do so, you would have a set of peg\nwords on which you could \u201chang\u201d memories. In fact, this mnemonic device is called the peg\nword technique. If you then needed to remember some discrete items\u2014say a grocery list, or\npoints you wanted to make in a speech\u2014this method would let you do so in a very precise\nyet flexible way. Suppose you had to remember bread, peanut butter, bananas, lettuce, and\nso on. The way to use the method is to form a vivid image of what you want to remember\nand imagine it interacting with your peg words (as many as you need). For example, for these\nitems, you might imagine a large gun (the first peg word) shooting a loaf of bread, then a jar\nof peanut butter inside a shoe, then large bunches of bananas hanging from a tree, then a\ndoor slamming on a head of lettuce with leaves flying everywhere. The idea is to provide good,\ndistinctive cues (the weirder the better!) for the information you need to remember while you\nare learning it. If you do this, then retrieving it later is relatively easy. You know your cues\nperfectly (one is gun, etc.), so you simply go through your cue word list and \u201clook\u201d in your\nmind\u2019s eye at the image stored there (bread, in this case).\nThis peg word method may sound strange at first, but it works quite well, even with little\ntraining (Roediger, 1980). One word of warning, though, is that the items to be remembered\nneed to be presented relatively slowly at first, until you have practice associating each with\nits cue word. People get faster with time. Another interesting aspect of this technique is that Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 168\nit\u2019s just as easy to recall the items in backwards order as forwards. This is because the peg\nwords provide direct access to the memorized items, regardless of order.\nHow did Simon Reinhard remember those digits? Essentially he has a much more complex\nsystem based on these same principles. In his case, he uses \u201cmemory palaces\u201d (elaborate\nscenes with discrete places) combined with huge sets of images for digits. For example,\nimagine mentally walking through the home where you grew up and identifying as many\ndistinct areas and objects as possible. Simon has hundreds of such memory palaces that he\nuses. Next, for remembering digits, he has memorized a set of 10,000 images. Every four-digit\nnumber for him immediately brings forth a mental image. So, for example, 6187 might recall\nMichael Jackson. When Simon hears all the numbers coming at him, he places an image for\nevery four digits into locations in his memory palace. He can do this at an incredibly rapid\nrate, faster than 4 digits per 4 seconds when they are flashed visually, as in the demonstration\nat the beginning of the module. As noted, his record is 240 digits, recalled in exact order.\nSimon also holds the world record in an event called \u201cspeed cards,\u201d which involves memorizing\nthe precise order of a shuffled deck of cards. Simon was able to do this in 21.19 seconds!\nAgain, he uses his memory palaces, and he encodes groups of cards as single images.\nMany books exist on how to improve memory using mnemonic devices, but all involve forming\ndistinctive encoding operations and then having an infallible set of memory cues. We should\nadd that to develop and use these memory systems beyond the basic peg system outlined\nabove takes a great amount of time and concentration. The World Memory Championships\nare held every year and the records keep improving. However, for most common purposes,\njust keep in mind that to remember well you need to encode information in a distinctive way\nand to have good cues for retrieval. You can adapt a system that will meet most any purpose. Memory (Encoding, Storage, Retrieval) 169\nOutside Resources\nBook: Brown, P.C., Roediger, H. L. & McDaniel, M. A. (2014).

Mnemonists like Simon Reinhard develop mental \u201cjourneys,\u201d which enable them to use the\nmethod of loci. Develop your own journey, which contains 20 places, in order, that you\nknow well. One example might be: the front walkway to your parents\u2019 apartment; their\ndoorbell; the couch in their living room; etc. Be sure to use a set of places that you know\nwell and that have a natural order to them (e.g., the walkway comes before the doorbell).\nNow you are more than halfway toward being able to memorize a set of 20 nouns, in order,\nrather quickly.

Loftus\nEyewitnesses can provide very compelling legal testimony, but rather than recording\nexperiences flawlessly, their memories are susceptible to a variety of errors and biases. They\n(like the rest of us) can make errors in remembering specific details and can even remember\nwhole events that did not actually happen. In this module, we discuss several of the common\ntypes of errors, and what they can tell us about human memory and its interactions with the\nlegal system.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Describe the kinds of mistakes that eyewitnesses commonly make and some of the ways\nthat this can impede justice.\n\u2022 Explain some of the errors that are common in human memory.\n\u2022 Describe some of the important research that has demonstrated human memory errors\nand their consequences.\nWhat Is Eyewitness Testimony?\nEyewitness testimony is what happens when a person witnesses a crime (or accident, or other\nlegally important event) and later gets up on the stand and recalls for the court all the details\nof the witnessed event. It involves a more complicated process than might initially be Eyewitness Testimony and Memory Biases 177\npresumed. It includes what happens\nduring the actual crime to facilitate or\nhamper witnessing, as well as everything\nthat happens from the time the event is\nover to the later courtroom appearance.\nThe eyewitness may be interviewed by\nthe police and numerous lawyers,\ndescribe the perpetrator to several\ndifferent people, and make an identification\nof the perpetrator, among other things.\nIf two people witness the same event will they both report seeing\nthe same things? [Photo: Sigfrid Lundberg]\nWhy Is Eyewitness Testimony\nan Important Area of Psychological Research?\nWhen an eyewitness stands up in front of the court and describes what happened from her\nown perspective, this testimony can be extremely compelling\u2014it is hard for those hearing\nthis testimony to take it \u201cwith a grain of salt,\u201d or otherwise adjust its power. But to what extent\nis this necessary?\nThere is now a wealth of evidence, from research conducted over several decades, suggesting\nthat eyewitness testimony is probably the most persuasive form of evidence presented in\ncourt, but in many cases, its accuracy is dubious. There is also evidence that mistaken\neyewitness evidence can lead to wrongful conviction\u2014sending people to prison for years or\ndecades, even to death row, for crimes they did not commit. Faulty eyewitness testimony has\nbeen implicated in at least 75% of DNA exoneration cases\u2014more than any other cause\n(Garrett, 2011). In a particularly famous case, a man named Ronald Cotton was identified by\na rape victim, Jennifer Thompson, as her rapist, and was found guilty and sentenced to life in\nprison. After more than 10 years, he was exonerated (and the real rapist identified) based on\nDNA evidence. For details on this case and other (relatively) lucky individuals whose false\nconvictions were subsequently overturned with DNA evidence, see the Innocence Project\nwebsite (http://www.innocenceproject.org/).\nThere is also hope, though, that many of the errors may be avoidable if proper precautions\nare taken during the investigative and judicial processes. Psychological science has taught us\nwhat some of those precautions might involve, and we discuss some of that science now.\nMisinformation Eyewitness Testimony and Memory Biases 178\nIn an early study of eyewitness memory, undergraduate\nsubjects first watched a slideshow depicting a small red car\ndriving and then hitting a pedestrian (Loftus, Miller, & Burns,\n1978). Some subjects were then asked leading questions\nabout what had happened in the slides. For example,\nsubjects were asked, \u201cHow fast was the car traveling when\nit passed the yield sign?\u201d But this question was actually\ndesigned to be misleading, because the original slide\nincluded a stop sign rather than a yield sign.\nLater, subjects were shown pairs of slides. One of the pair\nwas the original slide containing the stop sign; the other\nwas a replacement slide containing a yield sign. Subjects\nwere asked which of the pair they had previously seen.\nSubjects who had been asked about the yield sign were\nlikely to pick the slide showing the yield sign, even though\nthey had originally seen the slide with the stop sign. In other\nMisinformation can be introduced into\nwords, the misinformation in the leading question led to\nthe memory of a witness between the\ninaccurate memory.\ntime of seeing an event and reporting it\nlater. Something as straightforward as\nwhich sort of traffic sign was in place at This phenomenon is called the misinformation effect,\nan intersection can be confused if because the misinformation that subjects were exposed to\nsubjects are exposed to erroneous\nafter the event (here in the form of a misleading question)\ninformation after the initial incident.\napparently contaminates subjects\u2019 memories of what they\nwitnessed. Hundreds of subsequent studies have demonstrated that memory can be\ncontaminated by erroneous information that people are exposed to after they witness an\nevent (see Frenda, Nichols, & Loftus, 2011; Loftus, 2005). The misinformation in these studies\nhas led people to incorrectly remember everything from small but crucial details of a\nperpetrator\u2019s appearance to objects as large as a barn that wasn\u2019t there at all.\nThese studies have demonstrated that young adults (the typical research subjects in\npsychology) are often susceptible to misinformation, but that children and older adults can\nbe even more susceptible (Bartlett & Memon, 2007; Ceci & Bruck, 1995). In addition,\nmisinformation effects can occur easily, and without any intention to deceive (Allan & Gabbert,\n2008). Even slight differences in the wording of a question can lead to misinformation effects.\nSubjects in one study were more likely to say yes when asked \u201cDid you see the broken\nheadlight?\u201d than when asked \u201cDid you see a broken headlight?\u201d (Loftus, 1975).\nOther studies have shown that misinformation can corrupt memory even more easily when Eyewitness Testimony and Memory Biases 179\nit is encountered in social situations (Gabbert, Memon, Allan, & Wright, 2004). This is a problem\nparticularly in cases where more than one person witnesses a crime. In these cases, witnesses\ntend to talk to one another in the immediate aftermath of the crime, including as they wait\nfor police to arrive. But because different witnesses are different people with different\nperspectives, they are likely to see or notice different things, and thus remember different\nthings, even when they witness the same event. So when they communicate about the crime\nlater, they not only reinforce common memories for the event, they also contaminate each\nother\u2019s memories for the event (Gabbert, Memon, & Allan, 2003; Paterson & Kemp, 2006;\nTakarangi, Parker, & Garry, 2006).\nThe misinformation effect has been modeled in the laboratory. Researchers had subjects\nwatch a video in pairs. Both subjects sat in front of the same screen, but because they wore\ndifferently polarized glasses, they saw two different versions of a video, projected onto a\nscreen. So, although they were both watching the same screen, and believed (quite reasonably)\nthat they were watching the same video, they were actually watching two different versions\nof the video (Garry, French, Kinzett, & Mori, 2008).\nIn the video, Eric the electrician is seen wandering through an unoccupied house and helping\nhimself to the contents thereof. A total of eight details were different between the two videos.\nAfter watching the videos, the \u201cco-witnesses\u201d worked together on 12 memory test questions.\nFour of these questions dealt with details that were different in the two versions of the video,\nso subjects had the chance to influence one another. Then subjects worked individually on\n20 additional memory test questions. Eight of these were for details that were different in the\ntwo videos. Subjects\u2019 accuracy was highly dependent on whether they had discussed the\ndetails previously. Their accuracy for items they had not previously discussed with their co-\nwitness was 79%. But for items that they had discussed, their accuracy dropped markedly, to\n34%. That is, subjects allowed their co-witnesses to corrupt their memories for what they had\nseen.\nIdentifying Perpetrators\nIn addition to correctly remembering many details of the crimes they witness, eyewitnesses\noften need to remember the faces and other identifying features of the perpetrators of those\ncrimes. Eyewitnesses are often asked to describe that perpetrator to law enforcement and\nlater to make identifications from books of mug shots or lineups. Here, too, there is a\nsubstantial body of research demonstrating that eyewitnesses can make serious, but often\nunderstandable and even predictable, errors (Caputo & Dunning, 2007; Cutler & Penrod, 1995). Eyewitness Testimony and Memory Biases 180\nIn most jurisdictions in the United States, lineups are typically conducted with pictures, called\nphoto spreads, rather than with actual people standing behind one-way glass (Wells, Memon,\n& Penrod, 2006). The eyewitness is given a set of small pictures of perhaps six or eight\nindividuals who are dressed similarly and photographed in similar circumstances. One of\nthese individuals is the police suspect, and the remainder are \u201cfoils\u201d or \u201cfillers\u201d (people known\nto be innocent of the particular crime under investigation). If the eyewitness identifies the\nsuspect, then the investigation of that suspect is likely to progress. If a witness identifies a foil\nor no one, then the police may choose to move their investigation in another direction.\nThis process is modeled in laboratory\nstudies of eyewitness identifications. In\nthese studies, research subjects witness a\nmock crime (often as a short video) and\nthen are asked to make an identification\nfrom a photo or a live lineup. Sometimes\nthe lineups are target present, meaning\nthat the perpetrator from the mock crime\nis actually in the lineup, and sometimes\nthey are target absent, meaning that the\nlineup is made up entirely of foils. The\nsubjects, or mock witnesses, are given\nMistakes in identifying perpetrators can be influenced by a\nnumber of factors including poor viewing conditions, too little some instructions and asked to pick the\ntime to view the perpetrator, or too much delay from time of perpetrator out of the lineup. The\nwitnessing to identification. [Photo: Tim Snell] particular details of the witnessing\nexperience, the instructions, and the\nlineup members can all influence the extent to which the mock witness is likely to pick the\nperpetrator out of the lineup, or indeed to make any selection at all. Mock witnesses (and\nindeed real witnesses) can make errors in two different ways. They can fail to pick the\nperpetrator out of a target present lineup (by picking a foil or by neglecting to make a selection),\nor they can pick a foil in a target absent lineup (wherein the only correct choice is to not make\na selection).\nSome factors have been shown to make eyewitness identification errors particularly likely.\nThese include poor vision or viewing conditions during the crime, particularly stressful\nwitnessing experiences, too little time to view the perpetrator or perpetrators, too much delay\nbetween witnessing and identifying, and being asked to identify a perpetrator from a race\nother than one\u2019s own (Bornstein, Deffenbacher, Penrod, & McGorty, 2012; Brigham, Bennett,\nMeissner, & Mitchell, 2007; Burton, Wilson, Cowan, & Bruce, 1999; Deffenbacher, Bornstein,\nPenrod, & McGorty, 2004). Eyewitness Testimony and Memory Biases 181\nIt is hard for the legal system to do much about most of these problems. But there are some\nthings that the justice system can do to help lineup identifications \u201cgo right.\u201d For example,\ninvestigators can put together high-quality, fair lineups. A fair lineup is one in which the suspect\nand each of the foils is equally likely to be chosen by someone who has read an eyewitness\ndescription of the perpetrator but who did not actually witness the crime (Brigham, Ready, &\nSpier, 1990). This means that no one in the lineup should \u201cstick out,\u201d and that everyone should\nmatch the description given by the eyewitness. Other important recommendations that have\ncome out of this research include better ways to conduct lineups, \u201cdouble blind\u201d lineups,\nunbiased instructions for witnesses, and conducting lineups in a sequential fashion (see\nTechnical Working Group for Eyewitness Evidence, 1999; Wells et al., 1998; Wells & Olson,\n2003).\nKinds of Memory Biases\nMemory is also susceptible to a wide variety of other biases and errors. People can forget\nevents that happened to them and people they once knew. They can mix up details across\ntime and place. They can even remember whole complex events that never happened at all.\nImportantly, these errors, once made, can be very hard to unmake. A memory is no less\n\u201cmemorable\u201d just because it is wrong.\nSome small memory errors are commonplace, and you have no doubt experienced many of\nthem. You set down your keys without paying attention, and then cannot find them later when\nyou go to look for them. You try to come up with a person\u2019s name but cannot find it, even\nthough you have the sense that it is right at the tip of your tongue (psychologists actually call\nthis the tip-of-the-tongue effect, or TOT) (Brown, 1991).\nOther sorts of memory biases are more complicated and longer lasting. For example, it turns\nout that our expectations and beliefs about how the world works can have huge influences\non our memories. Because many aspects of our everyday lives are full of redundancies, our\nmemory systems take advantage of the recurring patterns by forming and using schemata,\nor memory templates (Alba & Hasher, 1983; Brewer & Treyens, 1981). Thus, we know to expect\nthat a library will have shelves and tables and librarians, and so we don\u2019t have to spend energy\nnoticing these at the time. The result of this lack of attention, however, is that one is likely to\nremember schema-consistent information (such as tables), and to remember them in a rather\ngeneric way, whether or not they were actually present.\nFalse Memory Eyewitness Testimony and Memory Biases 182\nFor most of our experiences schematas are a benefit and help with information overload.\nHowever, they may make it difficult or impossible to recall certain details of a situation\nlater. Do you recall the library as it actually was or the library as approximated by your\nlibrary schemata? [Photo: peyri]\nSome memory errors are so \u201clarge\u201d that they almost belong in a class of their own: false\nmemories. Back in the early 1990s a pattern emerged whereby people would go into therapy\nfor depression and other everyday problems, but over the course of the therapy develop\nmemories for violent and horrible victimhood (Loftus & Ketcham, 1994). These patients\u2019\ntherapists claimed that the patients were recovering genuine memories of real childhood\nabuse, buried deep in their minds for years or even decades. But some experimental\npsychologists believed that the memories were instead likely to be false\u2014created in therapy.\nThese researchers then set out to see whether it would indeed be possible for wholly false\nmemories to be created by procedures similar to those used in these patients\u2019 therapy.\nIn early false memory studies, undergraduate subjects\u2019 family members were recruited to\nprovide events from the students\u2019 lives. The student subjects were told that the researchers\nhad talked to their family members and learned about four different events from their\nchildhoods. The researchers asked if the now undergraduate students remembered each of\nthese four events\u2014introduced via short hints. The subjects were asked to write about each\nof the four events in a booklet and then were interviewed two separate times. The trick was\nthat one of the events came from the researchers rather than the family (and the family had\nactually assured the researchers that this event had not happened to the subject). In the first\nsuch study, this researcher-introduced event was a story about being lost in a shopping mall\nand rescued by an older adult. In this study, after just being asked whether they remembered Eyewitness Testimony and Memory Biases 183\nthese events occurring on three separate occasions, a quarter of subjects came to believe\nthat they had indeed been lost in the mall (Loftus & Pickrell, 1995). In subsequent studies,\nsimilar procedures were used to get subjects to believe that they nearly drowned and had\nbeen rescued by a lifeguard, or that they had spilled punch on the bride\u2019s parents at a family\nwedding, or that they had been attacked by a vicious animal as a child, among other events\n(Heaps & Nash, 1999; Hyman, Husband, & Billings, 1995; Porter, Yuille, & Lehman, 1999).\nMore recent false memory studies have used a variety of different manipulations to produce\nfalse memories in substantial minorities and even occasional majorities of manipulated\nsubjects (Braun, Ellis, & Loftus, 2002; Lindsay, Hagen, Read, Wade, & Garry, 2004; Mazzoni,\nLoftus, Seitz, & Lynn, 1999; Seamon, Philbin, & Harrison, 2006; Wade, Garry, Read, & Lindsay,\n2002). For example, one group of researchers used a mock-advertising study, wherein subjects\nwere asked to review (fake) advertisements for Disney vacations, to convince subjects that\nthey had once met the character Bugs Bunny at Disneyland\u2014an impossible false memory\nbecause Bugs is a Warner Brothers character (Braun et al., 2002). Another group of researchers\nphotoshopped childhood photographs of their subjects into a hot air balloon picture and then\nasked the subjects to try to remember and describe their hot air balloon experience (Wade\net al., 2002). Other researchers gave subjects unmanipulated class photographs from their\nchildhoods along with a fake story about a class prank, and thus enhanced the likelihood that\nsubjects would falsely remember the prank (Lindsay et al., 2004).\nUsing a false feedback manipulation, we have been able to persuade subjects to falsely\nremember having a variety of childhood experiences. In these studies, subjects are told\n(falsely) that a powerful computer system has analyzed questionnaires that they completed\npreviously and has concluded that they had a particular experience years earlier. Subjects\napparently believe what the computer says about them and adjust their memories to match\nthis new information. A variety of different false memories have been implanted in this way.\nIn some studies, subjects are told they once got sick on a particular food (Bernstein, Laney,\nMorris, & Loftus, 2005). These memories can then spill out into other aspects of subjects\u2019 lives,\nsuch that they often become less interested in eating that food in the future (Bernstein &\nLoftus, 2009b). Other false memories implanted with this methodology include having an\nunpleasant experience with the character Pluto at Disneyland and witnessing physical violence\nbetween one\u2019s parents (Berkowitz, Laney, Morris, Garry, & Loftus, 2008; Laney & Loftus, 2008).\nImportantly, once these false memories are implanted\u2014whether through complex methods\nor simple ones\u2014it is extremely difficult to tell them apart from true memories (Bernstein &\nLoftus, 2009a; Laney & Loftus, 2008).\nConclusion Eyewitness Testimony and Memory Biases 184\nTo conclude, eyewitness testimony is very powerful and convincing to jurors, even though it\nis not particularly reliable. Identification errors occur, and these errors can lead to people\nbeing falsely accused and even convicted. Likewise, eyewitness memory can be corrupted by\nleading questions, misinterpretations of events, conversations with co-witnesses, and their\nown expectations for what should have happened. People can even come to remember whole\nevents that never occurred.\nThe problems with memory in the legal system are real. But what can we do to start to fix\nthem? A number of specific recommendations have already been made, and many of these\nare in the process of being implemented (e.g., Steblay & Loftus, 2012; Technical Working Group\nfor Eyewitness Evidence, 1999; Wells et al., 1998). Some of these recommendations are aimed\nat specific legal procedures, including when and how witnesses should be interviewed, and\nhow lineups should be constructed and conducted. Other recommendations call for\nappropriate education (often in the form of expert witness testimony) to be provided to jury\nmembers and others tasked with assessing eyewitness memory. Eyewitness testimony can\nbe of great value to the legal system, but decades of research now argues that this testimony\nis often given far more weight than its accuracy justifies.

The failure to\nnotice unexpected objects or events when attention is focused elsewhere is now known as\ninattentional blindness. The study of such failures of awareness has a long history, but their\npractical importance has received increasing attention over the past decade. This module\ndescribes the history and status of research on inattentional blindness, discusses the reasons\nwhy we find these results to be counterintuitive, and the implications of failures of awareness\nfor how we see and act in our world.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Learn about inattentional blindness and why it occurs.\n\u2022 Identify ways in which failures of awareness are counterintuitive.\n\u2022 Better understand the link between focused attention and failures of awareness.\nDo you regularly spot editing errors in movies? Can you multitask effectively, texting while\ntalking with your friends or watching television? Are you fully aware of your surroundings? If\nyou answered yes to any of those questions, you\u2019re not alone. And, you\u2019re most likely wrong.\nMore than 50 years ago, experimental psychologists began documenting the many ways that\nour perception of the world is limited, not by our eyes and ears, but by our minds. We appear Failures of Awareness: The Case of Inattentional Blindness 190\nable to process only one stream of information at a time, effectively filtering other information\nfrom awareness. To a large extent, we perceive only that which receives the focus of our\ncognitive efforts: our attention.\nImagine the following task, known as\ndichotic listening (e.g., Cherry, 1953;\nMoray, 1959; Treisman, 1960): You put\non a set of headphones that play two\ncompletely different speech streams,\none to your left ear and one to your\nright ear. Your task is to repeat each\nsyllable spoken into your left ear as\nquickly and accurately as possible,\nmimicking each sound as you hear it.\nWhen performing this attention-\ndemanding task, you won\u2019t notice if the\nspeaker in your right ear switches to a\ndifferent language or is replaced by a\ndifferent speaker with a similar voice.\nYou won\u2019t notice if the content of their\nspeech becomes nonsensical. In effect,\nSome researchers contend that there really is no such thing as multi-\nyou are deaf to the substance of the\ntasking. Instead, people are just rapidly switching their attention\nignored speech. But, that is not\nbetween tasks, rather than holding those tasks in their attention at\nbecause of the limits of your auditory\nthe same time. [Image: Melvin Gaal]\nsenses. It is a form of cognitive\ndeafness, due to the nature of focused, selective attention. Even if the speaker on your right\nheadphone says your name, you will notice it only about one-third of the time (Conway, Cowan,\n& Bunting, 2001). And, at least by some accounts, you only notice it that often because you\nstill devote some of your limited attention to the ignored speech stream (Holendar, 1986). In\nthis task, you will tend to notice only large physical changes (e.g., a switch from a male to a\nfemale speaker), but not substantive ones, except in rare cases.\nThis selective listening task highlights the power of attention to filter extraneous information\nfrom awareness while letting in only those elements of our world that we want to hear. Focused\nattention is crucial to our powers of observation, making it possible for us to zero in on what\nwe want to see or hear while filtering out irrelevant distractions. But, it has consequences as\nwell: We can miss what would otherwise be obvious and important signals.\nThe same pattern holds for vision. In a groundbreaking series of studies in the 1970s and Failures of Awareness: The Case of Inattentional Blindness 191\nearly 1980s, Neisser and his colleagues devised a visual analogue of the dichotic listening task\n(Neisser & Becklen, 1975). Their subjects viewed a video of two distinct, but partially\ntransparent and overlapping, events. For example, one event might involve two people playing\na hand-clapping game and the other might show people passing a ball. Because the two events\nwere partially transparent and overlapping, both produced sensory signals on the retina\nregardless of which event received the participant\u2019s attention. When participants were asked\nto monitor one of the events by counting the number of times the actors performed an action\n(e.g., hand clapping or completed passes), they often failed to notice unexpected events in\nthe ignored video stream (e.g., the hand-clapping players stopping their game and shaking\nhands). As for dichotic listening, the participants were unaware of events happening outside\nthe focus of their attention, even when looking right at them. They could tell that other \u201cstuff\u201d\nwas happening on the screen, but many were unaware of the meaning or substance of that\nstuff.\nTo test the power of selective attention to\ninduce failures of awareness, Neisser and\ncolleagues (Neisser, 1979) designed a variant\nof this task in which participants watched a\nvideo of two teams of players, one wearing\nwhite shirts and one wearing black shirts.\nSubjects were asked to press a key whenever\nthe players in white successfully passed a ball,\nbut to ignore the players in black. As for the\nother videos, the teams were filmed separately\nand then superimposed so that they literally\noccupied the same space (they were partially\ntransparent). Partway through the video, a\nperson wearing a raincoat and carrying an\numbrella strolled through the scene. People\nwere so intently focused on spotting passes\nthat they often missed the \u201cumbrella woman.\u201d\n(Pro tip: If you look closely at the video, you\u2019ll\nsee that Ulric Neisser plays on both the black\nand white teams.)\nHave you ever been paying attention to something so\nThese surprising findings were well known in\nclosely you missed another event in the background? Or\nthe field, but for decades, researchers\nhave you ever been so used to seeing something a certain\nway that when it changed, you didn\u2019t even notice it had? dismissed their implications because the\n[Image: Lafayette College] displays had such an odd, ghostly appearance. Failures of Awareness: The Case of Inattentional Blindness 192\nOf course, we would notice if the displays were fully opaque and vivid rather than partly\ntransparent and grainy. Surprisingly, no studies were built on Neisser\u2019s method for nearly 20\nyears. Inspired by these counterintuitive findings and after discussing them with Neisser\nhimself, Christopher Chabris and I revisited them in the late 1990s (Simons & Chabris, 1999).\nWe replicated Neisser\u2019s work, again finding that many people missed the umbrella woman\nwhen all of the actors in the video were partially transparent and occupying the same space.\nBut, we added another wrinkle: a version of the video in which all of the actions of both teams\nof players were choreographed and filmed with a single camera. The players moved in and\naround each other and were fully visible. In the most dramatic version, we had a woman in a\ngorilla suit walk into the scene, stop to face the camera, thump her chest, and then walk off\nthe other side after nine seconds on screen. Fully half the observers missed the gorilla when\ncounting passes by the team in white.\nThis phenomenon is now known as inattentional blindness, the surprising failure to notice\nan unexpected object or event when attention is focused on something else (Mack & Rock,\n1998). The past 15 years has seen a surge of interest in such failures of awareness, and we\nnow have a better handle on the factors that cause people to miss unexpected events as well\nas the range of situations in which inattentional blindness occurs. People are much more\nlikely to notice unexpected objects that share features with the attended items in a display\n(Most et al., 2001). For example, if you count passes by the players wearing black, you are\nmore likely to notice the gorilla than if you count passes by the players wearing white because\nthe color of the gorilla more closely matches that of the black-shirted players (Simons &\nChabris, 1999). However, even unique items can go unnoticed. In one task, people monitored\nblack shapes and ignored white shapes that moved around a computer window (Most et al.,\n2001). Approximately 30\npercent of them failed to\ndetect the bright red\ncross traversing the display,\neven though it was the\nonly colored item and\nwas visible for five\nseconds.\nAnother crucial influence\non noticing is the effort\nyou put into the attention-\nTypically, even when we\u2019re intently focused on a stationary object, a moving object will\ndemanding task. If you\ncatch our attention. Why is this? Some researchers claim, evolutionarily speaking, we are\nhave to keep separate more attuned to movement because it likely indicated food or a threat was near. [Image:\ncounts of bounce passes Phil Roeder] Failures of Awareness: The Case of Inattentional Blindness 193\nand aerial passes, you are less likely to notice the gorilla (Simons & Chabris, 1999), and if you\nare tracking faster moving objects, you are less likely to notice (Simons & Jensen, 2009). You\ncan even miss unexpected visual objects when you devote your limited cognitive resources\nto a memory task (Fougnie & Marois, 2007), so the limits are not purely visual. Instead, they\nappear to reflect limits on the capacity of attention. Without attention to the unexpected\nevent, you are unlikely to become aware of it (Mack & Rock, 1998; Most, Scholl, Clifford, &\nSimons, 2005).\nInattentional blindness is not just a laboratory curiosity\u2014it also occurs in the real world and\nunder more natural conditions. In a recent study (Chabris, Weinberger, Fontaine, & Simons,\n2011), Chabris and colleagues simulated a famous police misconduct case in which a Boston\npolice officer was convicted of lying because he claimed not to have seen a brutal beating\n(Lehr, 2009). At the time, he had been chasing a murder suspect and ran right past the scene\nof a brutal assault. In Chabris\u2019 simulation, subjects jogged behind an experimenter who ran\nright past a simulated fight scene. At night, 65 percent missed the fight scene. Even during\nbroad daylight, 44 percent of observers jogged right passed it without noticing, lending some\nplausibility to the Boston cop\u2019s story that he was telling the truth and never saw the beating.\nPerhaps more importantly, auditory distractions can induce real-world failures to see.\nAlthough people believe they can multitask, few can. And, talking on a phone while driving or\nwalking decreases situation awareness and increases the chances that people will miss\nsomething important (Strayer & Johnston, 2001). In a dramatic illustration of cell phone\u2013\ninduced inattentional blindness, Ira Hymen observed that people talking on a cell phone as\nthey walked across a college campus were less likely than other pedestrians to notice a\nunicycling clown who rode across their path (Hyman, Boss, Wise, McKenzie, & Caggiano, 2011).\nRecently, the study of this sort of awareness failure has returned to its roots in studies of\nlistening, with studies documenting inattentional deafness: When listening to a set of spatially\nlocalized conversations over headphones, people often fail to notice the voice of a person\nwalking through the scene repeatedly stating \u201cI am a gorilla\u201d (Dalton & Fraenkel, 2012). Under\nconditions of focused attention, we see and hear far less of the unattended information than\nwe might expect (Macdonald & Lavie, 2011; Wayand, Levin, & Varakin, 2005).\nWe now have a good understanding of the ways in which focused attention affects the\ndetection of unexpected objects falling outside that focus. The greater the demands on\nattention, the less likely people are to notice objects falling outside their attention (Macdonald\n& Lavie, 2011; Simons & Chabris, 1999; Simons & Jensen, 2009). The more like the ignored\nelements of a scene, the less likely people are to notice. And, the more distracted we are, the\nless likely we are to be aware of our surroundings. Under conditions of distraction, we Failures of Awareness: The Case of Inattentional Blindness 194\neffectively develop tunnel vision.\nDespite this growing understanding\nof the limits of attention and the\nfactors that lead to more or less\nnoticing, we have relatively less\nunderstanding of individual differences\nin noticing (Simons & Jensen, 2009).\nDo some people consistently notice\nthe unexpected while others are\nobliviously unaware of their surrou\u00ad\nndings? Or, are we all subject to\ninattentional blindness due to\nNow you see me, now you don\u2019t! Although the research on attention has\nonly developed over the last few decades, magicians have been taking structural limits on the nature of\nadvantages of our susceptibility to misguided focus for centuries. [Image: attention? The question remains\nLes Black] controversial. A few studies suggest\nthat those people who have a\ngreater working memory capacity are more likely to notice unexpected objects (Hannon &\nRichards, 2010; Richards, Hannon, & Derakshan, 2010). In effect, those who have more\nresources available when focusing attention are more likely to spot other aspects of their\nworld. However, other studies find no such relationship: Those with greater working memory\ncapacity are not any more likely to spot an unexpected object or event (Seegmiller, Watson,\n& Strayer, 2011; Bredemeier & Simons, 2012). There are theoretical reasons to predict each\npattern. With more resources available, people should be more likely to notice (see Macdonald\n& Lavie, 2011). However, people with greater working memory capacity also tend to be better\nable to maintain their focus on their prescribed task, meaning that they should be less likely\nto notice. At least one study suggests that the ability to perform a task does not predict the\nlikelihood of noticing (Simons & Jensen, 2009; for a replication, see Bredemeier & Simons,\n2012). In a study I conducted with Melinda Jensen, we measured how well people could track\nmoving objects around a display, gradually increasing the speed until people reached a level\nof 75% accuracy. Tracking ability varied greatly: Some people could track objects at more than\ntwice the speed others could. Yet, the ability to track objects more easily was unrelated to the\nodds of noticing an unexpected event. Apparently, as long as people try to perform the tracking\ntask, they are relatively unlikely to notice unexpected events.\nWhat makes these findings interesting and important is that they run counter to our intuitions.\nMost people are confident they would notice the chest-thumping gorilla. In fact, nearly 90%\nbelieve they would spot the gorilla (Levin & Angelone, 2008), and in a national survey, 78%\nagreed with the statement, \u201cPeople generally notice when something unexpected enters their Failures of Awareness: The Case of Inattentional Blindness 195\nfield of view, even when they\u2019re paying attention to something else\u201d (Simons & Chabris, 2010).\nSimilarly, people are convinced that they would spot errors in movies or changes to a\nconversation partner (Levin & Angelone, 2008). We think we see and remember far more of\nour surroundings than we actually do. But why do we have such mistaken intuitions?\nOne explanation for this mistaken intuition is that our experiences themselves mislead us\n(Simons & Chabris, 2010). We rarely experience a study situation such as the gorilla experiment\nin which we are forced to confront something obvious that we just missed. That partly explains\nwhy demonstrations such as that one are so powerful: We expect that we would notice the\ngorilla, and we cannot readily explain away our failure to notice it. Most of the time, we are\nhappily unaware of what we have missed, but we are fully aware of those elements of a scene\nthat we have noticed. Consequently, if we assume our experiences are representative of the\nstate of the world, we will conclude that we notice unexpected events. We don\u2019t easily think\nabout what we\u2019re missing.\nGiven the limits on attention coupled with our mistaken impression that important events will\ncapture our attention, how has our species survived? Why weren\u2019t our ancestors eaten by\nunexpected predators? One reason is that our ability to focus attention intently might have\nbeen more evolutionarily useful than the ability to notice unexpected events. After all, for an\nevent to be unexpected, it must occur relatively infrequently. Moreover, most events don\u2019t\nrequire our immediate attention, so if inattentional blindness delays our ability to notice the\nevents, the consequences could well be minimal. In a social context, others might notice that\nevent and call attention to it. Although inattentional blindness might have had minimal\nconsequences over the course of our evolutionary history, it does have consequences now.\nAt pedestrian speeds and with minimal distraction, inattentional blindness might not matter\nfor survival. But in modern society, we face greater distractions and move at greater speeds,\nand even a minor delay in noticing something unexpected can mean the difference between\na fender-bender and a lethal collision. If talking on a phone increases your odds of missing a\nunicycling clown, it likely also increases your odds of missing the child who runs into the street\nor the car that runs a red light. Why, then, do people continue to talk on the phone when\ndriving? The reason might well be the same mistaken intuition that makes inattentional\nblindness surprising: Drivers simply do not notice how distracted they are when they are\ntalking on a phone, so they believe they can drive just as well when talking on a phone even\nthough they can\u2019t (Strayer & Johnston, 2001).\nSo, what can you do about inattentional blindness? The short answer appears to be, \u201cnot\nmuch.\u201d There is no magical elixir that will overcome the limits on attention, allowing you to\nnotice everything (and that would not be a good outcome anyway). But, there is something Failures of Awareness: The Case of Inattentional Blindness 196\nyou can do to mitigate the consequences of such limits. Now that you know about inattentional\nblindness, you can take steps to limit its impact by recognizing how your intuitions will lead\nyou astray.\nFirst, maximize the attention you\ndo have available by avoiding\ndistractions, especially under conditions\nfor which an unexpected event\nmight be catastrophic. The ring of\na new call or the ding of a new text\nare hard to resist, so make it\nimpossible to succumb to the\ntemptation by turning your phone\noff or putting it somewhere out of\nreach when you are driving. If you\nknow that you will be tempted and\nyou know that using your phone\nEven though you may think you can drive, text, listen to music, and make\na smoothie at the same time, really, your focus should be only on the road, will increase inattentional blindness,\nfor everything else can easily distract you from what\u2019s most important: you must be proactive. Second, pay\ndriving safely! [Image: Michael Heigl] attention to what others might not\nnotice. If you are a bicyclist, don\u2019t\nassume that the driver sees you, even if they appear to make eye contact. Looking is not the\nsame as seeing. Only by understanding the limits of attention and by recognizing our mistaken\nbeliefs about what we \u201cknow\u201d to be true can we avoid the modern-day consequences of those\nlimits.

Chapter 8: Motivation 11\nFunctions of Emotions\nHyisung Hwang & David Matsumoto\nEmotions play a crucial role in our lives because they have important functions. This module\ndescribes those functions, dividing the discussion into three areas: the intrapersonal, the\ninterpersonal, and the social and cultural functions of emotions. The section on the\nintrapersonal functions of emotion describes the roles that emotions play within each of us\nindividually; the section on the interpersonal functions of emotion describes the meanings\nof emotions to our relationships with others; and the section on the social and cultural\nfunctions of emotion describes the roles and meanings that emotions have to the\nmaintenance and effective functioning of our societies and cultures at large. All in all we will\nsee that emotions are a crucially important aspect of our psychological composition, having\nmeaning and function to each of us individually, to our relationships with others in groups,\nand to our societies as a whole.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Gain an appreciation of the importance of emotion in human life.\n\u2022 Understand the functions and meanings of emotion in three areas of life: the intrapersonal,\ninterpersonal, and social\u2013cultural.\n\u2022 Give examples of the role and function of emotion in each of the three areas described.\nIntroduction\nIt is impossible to imagine life without emotion. We treasure our feelings\u2014the joy at a ball Functions of Emotions 203\ngame, the pleasure of the\ntouch of a loved one, or the fun\nwith friends on a night out.\nEven negative emotions are\nimportant, such as the sadness\nwhen a loved one dies, the\nanger when violated, the fear\nthat overcomes us in a scary or\nunknown situation, or the guilt\nor shame toward others when\nour sins are made public.\nEmotions color life experiences\nand give those experiences\nmeaning and flavor.\nEmotions help us navigate the complex social landscape of our lives. [Image:\nDanilo Urbina]\nIn fact, emotions play many\nimportant roles in people\u2019s lives and have been the topic of scientific inquiry in psychology\nfor well over a century (Cannon, 1927; Darwin, 1872; James, 1890). This module explores why\nwe have emotions and why they are important. Doing so requires us to understand the\nfunction of emotions, and this module does so below by dividing the discussion into three\nsections. The first concerns the intrapersonal functions of emotion, which refer to the role\nthat emotions play within each of us individually. The second concerns the interpersonal\nfunctions of emotion, which refer to the role emotions play between individuals within a group.\nThe third concerns the social and cultural functions of emotion, which refer to the role that\nemotions play in the maintenance of social order within a society. All in all, we will see that\nemotions inform us of who we are, what our relationships with others are like, and how to\nbehave in social interactions. Emotions give meaning to events; without emotions, those\nevents would be mere facts. Emotions help coordinate interpersonal relationships. And\nemotions play an important role in the cultural functioning of keeping human societies\ntogether.\nIntrapersonal Functions of Emotion\nEmotions Help us Act Quickly with Minimal Conscious Awareness\nEmotions are rapid information-processing systems that help us act with minimal thinking\n(Tooby & Cosmides, 2008). Problems associated with birth, battle, death, and seduction have\noccurred throughout evolutionary history and emotions evolved to aid humans in adapting Functions of Emotions 204\nto those problems rapidly and\nwith minimal conscious cognitive\nintervention. If we did not have\nemotions, we could not make\nrapid decisions concerning whether\nto attack, defend, flee, care for\nothers, reject food, or approach\nsomething useful, all of which\nwere functionally adaptive in\nour evolutionary history and\nhelped us to survive. For\ninstance, drinking spoiled milk\nThe emotion of disgust serves to protect us from toxins and contamination, of\nor eating rotten eggs has\nthe physical and moral variety. Consider: would you wear a sweater that was\nnegative consequences for our\npreviously worn by a murderer? Probably not, even though there is no actual\nwelfare. The emotion of disgust,\n\u201ccontamination\u201d that will transfer from the sweater to you. [Image: Bill Couch]\nhowever, helps us immediately\ntake action by not ingesting them in the first place or by vomiting them out. This response is\nadaptive because it aids, ultimately, in our survival and allows us to act immediately without\nmuch thinking. In some instances, taking the time to sit and rationally think about what to do,\ncalculating cost\u2013benefit ratios in one\u2019s mind, is a luxury that might cost one one\u2019s life. Emotions\nevolved so that we can act without that depth of thinking.\nEmotions Prepare the Body for Immediate Action\nEmotions prepare us for behavior. When triggered, emotions orchestrate systems such as\nperception, attention, inference, learning, memory, goal choice, motivational priorities,\nphysiological reactions, motor behaviors, and behavioral decision making (Cosmides & Tooby,\n2000; Tooby & Cosmides, 2008). Emotions simultaneously activate certain systems and\ndeactivate others in order to prevent the chaos of competing systems operating at the same\ntime, allowing for coordinated responses to environmental stimuli (Levenson, 1999). For\ninstance, when we are afraid, our bodies shut down temporarily unneeded digestive\nprocesses, resulting in saliva reduction (a dry mouth); blood flows disproportionately to the\nlower half of the body; the visual field expands; and air is breathed in, all preparing the body\nto flee. Emotions initiate a system of components that includes subjective experience,\nexpressive behaviors, physiological reactions, action tendencies, and cognition, all for the\npurposes of specific actions; the term \u201cemotion\u201d is, in reality, a metaphor for these reactions.\nOne common misunderstanding many people have when thinking about emotions, however, Functions of Emotions 205\nis the belief that emotions must always directly produce action. This is not true. Emotion\ncertainly prepares the body for action; but whether people actually engage in action is\ndependent on many factors, such as the context within which the emotion has occurred, the\ntarget of the emotion, the perceived consequences of one\u2019s actions, previous experiences,\nand so forth (Baumeister, Vohs, DeWall, & Zhang, 2007; Matsumoto & Wilson, 2008). Thus,\nemotions are just one of many determinants of behavior, albeit an important one.\nEmotions Influence Thoughts\nEmotions are also connected to thoughts and memories. Memories are not just facts that are\nencoded in our brains; they are colored with the emotions felt at those times the facts occurred\n(Wang & Ross, 2007). Thus, emotions serve as the neural glue that connects those disparate\nfacts in our minds. That is why it is easier to remember happy thoughts when happy, and\nangry times when angry. Emotions serve as the affective basis of many attitudes, values, and\nbeliefs that we have about the world and the people around us; without emotions those\nattitudes, values, and beliefs would be just statements without meaning, and emotions give\nthose statements meaning. Emotions influence our thinking processes, sometimes in\nconstructive ways, sometimes not. It is difficult to think critically and clearly when we feel\nintense emotions, but easier when we are not overwhelmed with emotions (Matsumoto,\nHirayama, & LeRoux, 2006).\nEmotions Motivate Future Behaviors\nBecause emotions prepare our bodies for immediate action, influence thoughts, and can be\nfelt, they are important motivators of future behavior. Many of us strive to experience the\nfeelings of satisfaction, joy, pride, or triumph in our accomplishments and achievements. At\nthe same time, we also work very hard to avoid strong negative feelings; for example, once\nwe have felt the emotion of disgust when drinking the spoiled milk, we generally work very\nhard to avoid having those feelings again (e.g., checking the expiration date on the label before\nbuying the milk, smelling the milk before drinking it, watching if the milk curdles in one\u2019s coffee\nbefore drinking it). Emotions, therefore, not only influence immediate actions but also serve\nas an important motivational basis for future behaviors.\nInterpersonal Functions of Emotion\nEmotions are expressed both verbally through words and nonverbally through facial\nexpressions, voices, gestures, body postures, and movements. We are constantly expressing Functions of Emotions 206\nemotions when interacting\nwith others, and others can\nreliably judge those emotional\nexpressions (Elfenbein & Ambady,\n2002; Matsumoto, 2001); thus,\nemotions have signal value to\nothers and influence others\nand our social interactions.\nEmotions and their expressions\ncommunicate information to\nothers about our feelings,\nintentions, relationship with\nthe target of the emotions, Emotions can act as signals to our friends and partners, conveying information\nand the environment. Because about the quality of the relationship. [Image: Mo Riza]\nemotions have this communi\u00ad\ncative signal value, they help solve social problems by evoking responses from others, by\nsignaling the nature of interpersonal relationships, and by providing incentives for desired\nsocial behavior (Keltner, 2003).\nEmotional Expressions Facilitate Specific Behaviors in Perceivers\nBecause facial expressions of emotion are universal social signals, they contain meaning not\nonly about the expressor\u2019s psychological state but also about that person\u2019s intent and\nsubsequent behavior. This information affects what the perceiver is likely to do. People\nobserving fearful faces, for instance, are more likely to produce approach-related behaviors,\nwhereas people who observe angry faces are more likely to produce avoidance-related\nbehaviors (Marsh, Ambady, & Kleck, 2005). Even subliminal presentation of smiles produces\nincreases in how much beverage people pour and consume and how much they are willing\nto pay for it; presentation of angry faces decreases these behaviors (Winkielman, Berridge, &\nWilbarger, 2005). Also, emotional displays evoke specific, complementary emotional\nresponses from observers; for example, anger evokes fear in others (Dimberg & Ohman, 1996;\nEsteves, Dimberg, & Ohman, 1994), whereas distress evokes sympathy and aid (Eisenberg et\nal., 1989).\nEmotional Expressions Signal the Nature of Interpersonal Relationships\nEmotional expressions provide information about the nature of the relationships among\ninteractants. Some of the most important and provocative set of findings in this area come Functions of Emotions 207\nfrom studies involving married couples (Gottman & Levenson, 1992; Gottman, Levenson, &\nWoodin, 2001). In this research, married couples visited a laboratory after having not seen\neach other for 24 hours, and then engaged in intimate conversations about daily events or\nissues of conflict. Discrete expressions of contempt, especially by the men, and disgust,\nespecially by the women, predicted later marital dissatisfaction and even divorce.\nEmotional Expressions Provide Incentives for Desired Social Behavior\nFacial expressions of emotion are important regulators of social interaction. In the\ndevelopmental literature, this concept has been investigated under the concept of social\nreferencing (Klinnert, Campos, & Sorce, 1983); that is, the process whereby infants seek out\ninformation from others to clarify a situation and then use that information to act. To date,\nthe strongest demonstration of social referencing comes from work on the visual cliff. In the\nfirst study to investigate this concept, Campos and colleagues (Sorce, Emde, Campos, &\nKlinnert, 1985) placed mothers on the far end of the \u201ccliff\u201d from the infant. Mothers first smiled\nto the infants and placed a toy on top the safety glass to attract them; infants invariably began\ncrawling to their mothers. When the infants were in the center of the table, however, the\nmother then posed an expression of fear, sadness, anger, interest, or joy. The results were\nclearly different for the different faces; no infant crossed the table when the mother showed\nfear; only 6% did when the mother posed anger, 33% crossed when the mother posed sadness,\nand approximately 75% of the infants crossed when the mother posed joy or interest.\nOther studies provide similar support for facial expressions as regulators of social interaction.\nIn one study (Bradshaw, 1986), experimenters posed facial expressions of neutral, anger, or\ndisgust toward babies as they moved toward an object and measured the amount of inhibition\nthe babies showed in touching the object. The results for 10- and 15-month olds were the\nsame: anger produced the greatest inhibition, followed by disgust, with neutral the least. This\nstudy was later replicated (Hertenstein & Campos, 2004) using joy and disgust expressions,\naltering the method so that the infants were not allowed to touch the toy (compared with a\ndistractor object) until one hour after exposure to the expression. At 14 months of age,\nsignificantly more infants touched the toy when they saw joyful expressions, but fewer touched\nthe toy when the infants saw disgust.\nSocial and Cultural Functions of Emotion\nIf you stop to think about many things we take for granted in our daily lives, we cannot help\nbut come to the conclusion that modern human life is a colorful tapestry of many groups and\nindividual lives woven together in a complex yet functional way. For example, when you\u2019re Functions of Emotions 208\nhungry, you might go to the local\ngrocery store and buy some\nfood. Ever stop to think about\nhow you\u2019re able to do that? You\nmight buy a banana that was\ngrown in a field in southeast Asia\nbeing raised by farmers there,\nwhere they planted the tree,\ncared for it, and picked the fruit.\nThey probably handed that fruit\noff to a distribution chain that\nallowed multiple people somewhere\nto use tools such as cranes,\nAlthough there are cultural differences in the display of emotion, almost all trucks, cargo bins, ships or\ninfants start showing emotion such as smiling or reacting to their caretaker as airplanes (that were also created\nearly as 6 weeks after their birth. [Image: Christopher Lance] by multiple people somewhere)\nto bring that banana to your\nstore. The store had people to care for that banana until you came and got it and to barter\nwith you for it (with your money). You may have gotten to the store riding a vehicle that was\nproduced somewhere else in the world by others, and you were probably wearing clothes\nproduced by some other people somewhere else.\nThus, human social life is complex. Individuals are members of multiple groups, with multiple\nsocial roles, norms, and expectations, and people move rapidly in and out of the multiple\ngroups of which they are members. Moreover, much of human social life is unique because\nit revolves around cities, where many people of disparate backgrounds come together. This\ncreates the enormous potential for social chaos, which can easily occur if individuals are not\ncoordinated well and relationships not organized systematically.\nOne of the important functions of culture is to provide this necessary coordination and\norganization. Doing so allows individuals and groups to negotiate the social complexity of\nhuman social life, thereby maintaining social order and preventing social chaos. Culture does\nthis by providing a meaning and information system to its members, which is shared by a\ngroup and transmitted across generations, that allows the group to meet basic needs of\nsurvival, pursue happiness and well-being, and derive meaning from life (Matsumoto & Juang,\n2013). Culture is what allowed the banana from southeast Asia to appear on your table.\nCultural transmission of the meaning and information system to its members is, therefore, a\ncrucial aspect of culture. One of the ways this transmission occurs is through the development Functions of Emotions 209\nof worldviews (including attitudes, values, beliefs, and norms) related to emotions (Matsumoto\n& Hwang, 2013; Matsumoto et al., 2008). Worldviews related to emotions provide guidelines\nfor desirable emotions that facilitate norms for regulating individual behaviors and\ninterpersonal relationships. Our cultural backgrounds tell us which emotions are ideal to have,\nand which are not (Tsai, Knutson, & Fung, 2006). The cultural transmission of information\nrelated to emotions occurs in many ways, from childrearers to children, as well as from the\ncultural products available in our world, such as books, movies, ads, and the like (Sch\u00f6npflug,\n2009; Tsai, Louie, Chen, & Uchida, 2007).\nCultures also inform us about what to do with our emotions\u2014that is, how to manage or modify\nthem\u2014when we experience them. One of the ways in which this is done is through the\nmanagement of our emotional expressions through cultural display rules (Friesen, 1972).\nThese are rules that are learned early in life that specify the management and modification\nof our emotional expressions according to social circumstances. Thus, we learn that \u201cbig boys\ndon\u2019t cry\u201d or to laugh at the boss\u2019s jokes even though they\u2019re not funny. By affecting how\nindividuals express their emotions, culture also influences how people experience them as\nwell.\nBecause one of the major functions of culture is to maintain social order in order to ensure\ngroup efficiency and thus survival, cultures create worldviews, rules, guidelines, and norms\nconcerning emotions because emotions have important intra- and interpersonal functions,\nas described above, and are important motivators of behavior. Norms concerning emotion\nand its regulation in all cultures serve the purpose of maintaining social order. Cultural\nworldviews and norms help us manage and modify our emotional reactions (and thus\nbehaviors) by helping us to have certain kinds of emotional experiences in the first place and\nby managing our reactions and subsequent behaviors once we have them. By doing so, our\nculturally moderated emotions can help us engage in socially appropriate behaviors, as\ndefined by our cultures, and thus reduce social complexity and increase social order, avoiding\nsocial chaos. All of this allows us to live relatively harmonious and constructive lives in groups.\nIf cultural worldviews and norms about emotions did not exist, people would just run amok\nhaving all kinds of emotional experiences, expressing their emotions and then behaving in\nall sorts of unpredictable and potentially harmful ways. If that were the case, it would be very\ndifficult for groups and societies to function effectively, and even for humans to survive as a\nspecies, if emotions were not regulated in culturally defined ways for the common, social\ngood. Thus, emotions play a critical role in the successful functioning of any society and culture. Functions of Emotions 210\nOutside Resources\nAlberta, G. M., Rieckmann, T. R., & Rush, J. D. (2000).

Functions of Emotions 212\nVocabulary\nCultural display rules\nThese are rules that are learned early in life that specify the management and modification\nof emotional expressions according to social circumstances. Cultural display rules can work\nin a number of different ways. For example, they can require individuals to express emotions\n\u201cas is\u201d (i.e., as they feel them), to exaggerate their expressions to show more than what is\nactually felt, to tone down their expressions to show less than what is actually felt, to conceal\ntheir feelings by expressing something else, or to show nothing at all.\nInterpersonal\nThis refers to the relationship or interaction between two or more individuals in a group. Thus,\nthe interpersonal functions of emotion refer to the effects of one\u2019s emotion on others, or to\nthe relationship between oneself and others.\nIntrapersonal\nThis refers to what occurs within oneself. Thus, the intrapersonal functions of emotion refer\nto the effects of emotion to individuals that occur physically inside their bodies and\npsychologically inside their minds.\nSocial and cultural\nSociety refers to a system of relationships between individuals and groups of individuals;\nculture refers to the meaning and information afforded to that system that is transmitted\nacross generations. Thus, the social and cultural functions of emotion refer to the effects that\nemotions have on the functioning and maintenance of societies and cultures.\nSocial referencing\nThis refers to the process whereby individuals look for information from others to clarify a\nsituation, and then use that information to act. Thus, individuals will often use the emotional\nexpressions of others as a source of information to make decisions about their own behavior. Functions of Emotions 213\nReferences\nBaumeister, R.

This module\nprovides an overview of the main theories and findings on goals and motivation. We address\nthe origins, manifestations, and types of goals, and the various factors that influence\nmotivation in goal pursuit. We further address goal conflict and, specifically, the exercise of\nself-control in protecting long-term goals from momentary temptations.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Define the basic terminology related to goals, motivation, self-regulation, and self-control.\n\u2022 Describe the antecedents and consequences of goal activation.\n\u2022 Describe the factors that influence motivation in the course of goal pursuit.\n\u2022 Explain the process underlying goal activation, self-regulation, and self-control.\n\u2022 Give examples of goal activation effects, self-regulation processes, and self-control\nprocesses.\nIntroduction\nEvery New Year, many people make resolutions\u2014or goals\u2014that go unsatisfied: eat healthier;\npay better attention in class; lose weight. As much as we know our lives would improve if we\nactually achieved these goals, people quite often don\u2019t follow through. But what if that didn\u2019t\nhave to be the case? What if every time we made a goal, we actually accomplished it? Each\nday, our behavior is the result of countless goals\u2014maybe not goals in the way we think of Motives and Goals 217\nthem, like getting that beach body or being the first person to land on Mars. But even with\n\u201cmundane\u201d goals, like getting food from the grocery store, or showing up to work on time, we\nare often enacting the same psychological processes involved with achieving loftier dreams.\nTo understand how we can better attain our goals, let\u2019s begin with defining what a goal is and\nwhat underlies it, psychologically.\nA goal is the cognitive representation of a\ndesired state, or, in other words, our mental\nidea of how we\u2019d like things to turn out\n(Fishbach & Ferguson 2007; Kruglanski,\n1996). This desired end state of a goal can\nbe clearly defined (e.g., stepping on the\nsurface of Mars), or it can be more abstract\nand represent a state that is never fully\ncompleted (e.g., eating healthy). Underlying\nall of these goals, though, is motivation, or\nthe psychological driving force that enables\naction in the pursuit of that goal (Lewin,\n1935). Motivation can stem from two places.\nGoals are fundamental guides for human behavior. Some are\nFirst, it can come from the benefits\nbiological in origin, some are cultural in nature and some are\nassociated with the process of pursuing a\nunique to the individual. [Photo: SweetOnVeg]\ngoal (intrinsic motivation). For example, you\nmight be driven by the desire to have a fulfilling experience while working on your Mars\nmission. Second, motivation can also come from the benefits associated with achieving a goal\n(extrinsic motivation), such as the fame and fortune that come with being the first person on\nMars (Deci & Ryan, 1985). One easy way to consider intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is through\nthe eyes of a student. Does the student work hard on assignments because the act of learning\nis pleasing (intrinsic motivation)? Or does the student work hard to get good grades, which\nwill help land a good job (extrinsic motivation)?\nSocial psychologists recognize that goal pursuit and the motivations that underlie it do not\ndepend solely on an individual\u2019s personality. Rather, they are products of personal\ncharacteristics and situational factors. Indeed, cues in a person\u2019s immediate environment\u2014\nincluding images, words, sounds, and the presence of other people\u2014can activate, or prime,\na goal. This activation can be conscious, such that the person is aware of the environmental\ncues influencing his/her pursuit of a goal. However, this activation can also occur outside a\nperson\u2019s awareness, and lead to nonconscious goal pursuit. In this case, the person is unaware\nof why s/he is pursuing a goal and may not even realize that s/he is pursuing it. Motives and Goals 218\nIn this module, we review key aspects of goals and motivation. First, we discuss the origins\nand manifestation of goals. Then, we review factors that influence individuals\u2019 motivation in\nthe course of pursuing a goal (self-regulation). Finally, we discuss what motivates individuals\nto keep following their goals when faced with other conflicting desires\u2014for example, when a\ntempting opportunity to socialize on Facebook presents itself in the course of studying for an\nexam (self-control).\nThe Origins and Manifestation of Goals\nGoal Adoption\nWhat makes us commit to a goal? Researchers tend to agree that commitment stems from\nthe sense that a goal is both valuable and attainable, and that we adopt goals that are highly\nlikely to bring positive outcomes (i.e., one\u2019s commitment = the value of the goal \u00d7 the expectancy\nit will be achieved) (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1974; Liberman & F\u00f6rster, 2008). This process of\ncommitting to a goal can occur without much conscious deliberation. For example, people\ninfer value and attainability, and will nonconsciously determine their commitment based on\nthose factors, as well as the outcomes of past goals. Indeed, people often learn about\nthemselves the same way they learn about other people\u2014by observing their behaviors (in\nthis case, their own) and drawing inferences about their preferences. For example, after taking\na kickboxing class, you might infer from your efforts that you are indeed committed to staying\nphysically fit (Fishbach, Zhang, & Koo, 2009).\nGoal Priming\nWe don\u2019t always act on our goals in every context. For instance, sometimes we\u2019ll order a salad\nfor lunch, in keeping with our dietary goals, while other times we\u2019ll order only dessert. So,\nwhat makes people adhere to a goal in any given context? Cues in the immediate environment\n(e.g., objects, images, sounds\u2014anything that primes a goal) can have a remarkable influence\non the pursuit of goals to which people are already committed (Bargh, 1990; Custers, Aarts,\nOikawa, & Elliot, 2009; F\u00f6rster, Liberman, & Friedman, 2007). How do these cues work? In\nmemory, goals are organized in associative networks. That is, each goal is connected to other\ngoals, concepts, and behaviors. Particularly, each goal is connected to corresponding means\n\u2014activities and objects that help us attain the goal (Kruglanski et al., 2002). For example, the\ngoal to stay physically fit may be associated with several means, including a nearby gym, one\u2019s\nbicycle, or even a training partner. Cues related to the goal or means (e.g., an ad for running\nshoes, a comment about weight loss) can activate or prime the pursuit of that goal. For Motives and Goals 219\nexample, the presence of one\u2019s training partner, or even seeing the word \u201cworkout\u201d in a puzzle,\ncan activate the goal of staying physically fit and, hence, increase a person\u2019s motivation to\nexercise. Soon after goal priming, the motivation to act on the goal peaks then slowly declines,\nafter some delay, as the person moves away from the primer or after s/he pursues the goal\n(Bargh, Gollwitzer, Lee-Chai, Barndollar, & Trotschel, 2001).\nConsequences of Goal Activation\nThe activation of a goal and the\naccompanying increase in motivation can\ninfluence many aspects of behavior and\njudgment, including how people perceive,\nevaluate, and feel about the world around\nthem. Indeed, motivational states can even\nalter something as fundamental as visual\nperception. For example, Balcetis and\nDunning (2006) showed participants an\nambiguous figure (e.g., \u201cI3\u201d) and asked them\nwhether they saw the letter B or the number\n13. The researchers found that when\nparticipants had the goal of seeing a letter (e.\ng., because seeing a number required the\nparticipants to drink a gross tasting juice),\nWhat does this image represent to you, a number or a letter?\nthey in fact saw a B. It wasn\u2019t that the Training to run the Boston Marathon? Need to pass 13 credit\nparticipants were simply lying, either; their hours to graduate this semester? The details of your goals\nmay influence how you interpret the world around you.\ngoal literally changed how they perceived the\n[Photo: Leo Reynolds]\nworld!\nGoals can also exert a strong influence on how people evaluate the objects (and people)\naround them. When pursuing a goal such as quenching one\u2019s thirst, people evaluate goal-\nrelevant objects (e.g., a glass) more positively than objects that are not relevant to the goal (e.\ng., a pencil). Furthermore, those with the goal of quenching their thirst rate the glass more\npositively than people who are not pursuing the goal (Ferguson & Bargh, 2004). As discussed\nearlier, priming a goal can lead to behaviors like this (consistent with the goal), even though\nthe person isn\u2019t necessarily aware of why (i.e., the source of the motivation). For example,\nafter research participants saw words related to achievement (in the context of solving a word\nsearch), they automatically performed better on a subsequent achievement test\u2014without\nbeing at all aware that the achievement words had influenced them (Bargh & Chartrand, 1999; Motives and Goals 220\nSrull & Wyer, 1979).\nSelf-Regulation in Goal Pursuit\nMany of the behaviors we like to engage in are inconsistent with achieving our goals. For\nexample, you may want to be physically fit, but you may also really like German chocolate\ncake. Self-regulation refers to the process through which individuals alter their perceptions,\nfeelings, and actions in the pursuit of a goal. For example, filling up on fruits at a dessert party\nis one way someone might alter his or her actions to help with goal attainment. In the following\nsection, we review the main theories and findings on self-regulation.\nFrom Deliberation to Implementation\nSelf-regulation involves two basic stages, each with its own distinct mindset. First, a person\nmust decide which of many potential goals to pursue at a given point in time (deliberative\nphase). While in the deliberative phase, a person often has a mindset that fosters an effective\nassessment of goals. That is, one tends to be open-minded and realistic about available goals\nto pursue. However, such scrutiny of one\u2019s choices sometimes hinders action. For example,\nin the deliberative phase about how to spend time, someone might consider improving health,\nacademic performance, or developing a hobby. At the same time, though, this deliberation\ninvolves considering realistic obstacles, such as one\u2019s busy schedule, which may discourage\nthe person from believing the goals can likely be achieved (and thus, doesn\u2019t work toward any\nof them).\nHowever, after deciding which goal to follow, the second stage involves planning specific\nactions related to the goal (implemental phase). In the implemental phase, a person tends\nto have a mindset conducive to the effective implementation of a goal through immediate\naction\u2014i.e., with the planning done, we\u2019re ready to jump right into attaining our goal.\nUnfortunately, though, this mindset often leads to closed-mindedness and unrealistically\npositive expectations about the chosen goal (Gollwitzer, Heckhausen, & Steller, 1990;\nKruglanski et al., 2000; Thaler & Shefrin, 1981). For example, in order to follow a health goal,\na person might register for a gym membership and start exercising. In doing so, s/he assumes\nthis is all that\u2019s needed to achieve the goal (closed-mindedness), and after a few weeks, it\nshould be accomplished (unrealistic expectations).\nRegulation of Ought- and Ideals-Goals Motives and Goals 221\nIn addition to two phases in goal pursuit, research\nalso distinguishes between two distinct self-\nregulatory orientations (or perceptions of effectiveness)\nin pursuing a goal: prevention and promotion. A\nprevention focus emphasizes safety, responsibility,\nand security needs, and views goals as \u201coughts.\u201d That\nis, for those who are prevention-oriented, a goal is\nviewed as something they should be doing, and they\ntend to focus on avoiding potential problems (e.g.,\nexercising to avoid health threats). This self-\nregulatory focus leads to a vigilant strategy aimed\nat avoiding losses (the presence of negatives) and\napproaching non-losses (the absence of negatives).\nOn the other hand, a promotion focus views goals as\n\u201cideals,\u201d and emphasizes hopes, accomplishments,\nand advancement needs. Here, people view their\nDifferent individuals may have different orientations goals as something they want to do that will bring\ntoward the same goal. One person - with a\nthem added pleasure (e.g., exercising because being\nprevention orientation -might pursue a fitness goal\nhealthy allows them to do more activities). This type\nprimarily to prevent negative health problems, while\nof orientation leads to the adoption of an eager\nanother person - with a promotion orientation -\nmight pursue the same goal in order to look and feel strategy concerned with approaching gains (the\nbetter. [Photo: thelearningcurvedotca] presence of positives) and avoiding non-gains (the\nabsence of positives).\nTo compare these two strategies, consider the goal of saving money. Prevention-focused\npeople will save money because they believe it\u2019s what they should be doing (an ought), and\nbecause they\u2019re concerned about not having any money (avoiding a harm). Promotion-focused\npeople, on the other hand, will save money because they want to have extra funds (a desire)\nso they can do new and fun activities (attaining an advancement). Although these two\nstrategies result in very similar behaviors, emphasizing potential losses will motivate\nindividuals with a prevention focus, whereas emphasizing potential gains will motivate\nindividuals with a promotion focus. And these orientations\u2014responding better to either a\nprevention or promotion focus\u2014 differ across individuals (chronic regulatory focus) and\nsituations (momentary regulatory focus; Higgins, 1997).\nA Cybernetic Process of Self-Regulation\nSelf-regulation depends on feelings that arise from comparing actual progress to expected Motives and Goals 222\nprogress. During goal pursuit, individuals calculate the discrepancy between their current\nstate (i.e., all goal-related actions completed so far) and their desired end state (i.e., what they\nview as \u201cachieving the goal\u201d). After determining this difference, the person then acts to close\nthat gap (Miller, Galanter, & Pribram, 1960; Powers, 1973). In this cybernetic process of self-\nregulation (or, internal system directing how a person should control behavior), a higher-than-\nexpected rate of closing the discrepancy creates a signal in the form of positive feelings. For\nexample, if you\u2019re nearly finished with a class project (i.e., a low discrepancy between your\nprogress and what it will take to completely finish), you feel good about yourself. However,\nthese positive feelings tend to make individuals \u201ccoast,\u201d or reduce their efforts on the focal\ngoal, and shift their focus to other goals (e.g., you\u2019re almost done with your project for one\nclass, so you start working on a paper for another). By contrast, a lower-than-expected rate\nof closing the gap elicits negative feelings, which leads to greater effort investment on the\nfocal goal (Carver & Scheier, 1998). If it is the day before a project\u2019s due and you\u2019ve hardly\nstarted it, you will likely feel anxious and stop all other activities to make progress on your\nproject.\nHighlighting One Goal or Balancing Between Goals\nWhen we\u2019ve completed steps toward achieving our goal, looking back on the behaviors or\nactions that helped us make such progress can have implications for future behaviors and\nactions (see The Dynamics of Self-Regulation framework; Fishbach et al., 2009). Remember,\ncommitment results from the perceived value and attainability of a goal, whereas progress\ndescribes the perception of a reduced discrepancy between the current state and desired end\nstate (i.e., the cybernetic process). After achieving a goal, when people interpret their previous\nactions as a sign of commitment to it, they tend to highlight the pursuit of that goal, prioritizing\nit and putting more effort toward it. However, when people interpret their previous actions\nas a sign of progress, they tend to balance between the goal and other goals, putting less\neffort into the focal goal. For example, if buying a product on sale reinforces your commitment\nto the goal of saving money, you will continue to behave financially responsibly. However, if\nyou perceive the same action (buying the sale item) as evidence of progress toward the goal\nof saving money, you might feel like you can \u201ctake a break\u201d from your goal, justifying splurging\non a subsequent purchase. Several factors can influence the meanings people assign to\nprevious goal actions. For example, the more confident a person is about a commitment to\na goal, the more likely s/he is to infer progress rather than commitment from his/her actions\n(Koo & Fishbach, 2008).\nConflicting Goals and Self-Control Motives and Goals 223\nIn the pursuit of our ordinary and\nextraordinary goals (e.g., staying physically\nor financially healthy, landing on Mars), we\ninevitably come across other goals (e.g.,\neating delicious food, exploring Earth) that\nmight get in the way of our lofty ambitions.\nIn such situations, we must exercise self-\ncontrol to stay on course. Self-control is the\ncapacity to control impulses, emotions,\ndesires, and actions in order to resist a\ntemptation (e.g., going on a shopping spree)\nand protect a valued goal (e.g., stay\nfinancially sound). As such, self-control is a\nprocess of self-regulation in contexts\nImmediate gratification has a way of interfering with the pursuit involving a clear trade-off between long-\nof more significant long-term goals. New shoes feel awfully term interests (e.g., health, financial, or\ngood right now but don't do anything to get us closer to our\nMartian) and some form of immediate\nfinancial savings target. [Photo: LipglossJunkie]\ngratification (Fishbach & Converse, 2010;\nRachlin, 2000; Read, Loewenstein, & Rabin, 1999; Thaler & Shefrin, 1981). For example,\nwhereas reading each page of a textbook requires self-regulation, doing so while resisting the\ntempting sounds of friends socializing in the next room requires self-control. And although\nyou may tend to believe self-control is just a personal characteristic that varies across\nindividuals, it is like a muscle, in that it becomes drained by being used but is also strengthened\nin the process.\nSelf-Control as an Innate Ability\nMischel, Shoda, and Rodriguez (1989) identified enduring individual differences in self-control\nand found that the persistent capacity to postpone immediate gratification for the sake of\nfuture interests leads to greater cognitive and social competence over the course of a lifetime.\nIn a famous series of lab experiments (first conducted by Mischel & Baker, 1975), preschoolers\n3\u20135 years old were asked to choose between getting a smaller treat immediately (e.g., a single\nmarshmallow) or waiting as long as 15 minutes to get a better one (e.g., two marshmallows).\nSome children were better-able to exercise self-control than others, resisting the temptation\nto take the available treat and waiting for the better one. Following up with these preschoolers\nten years later, the researchers found that the children who were able to wait longer in the\nexperiment for the second marshmallow (vs. those who more quickly ate the single\nmarshmallow) performed better academically and socially, and had better psychological Motives and Goals 224\ncoping skills as adolescents.\nSelf-Control as a Limited Resource\nBeyond personal characteristics, the ability to\nexercise self-control can fluctuate from one\ncontext to the next. In particular, previous\nexertion of self-control (e.g., choosing not to eat\na donut) drains individuals of the limited\nphysiological and psychological resources\nrequired to continue the pursuit of a goal (e.g.,\nlater in the day, again resisting a sugary treat).\nEgo-depletion refers to this exhaustion of\nresources from resisting a temptation. That is,\njust like bicycling for two hours would exhaust\nsomeone before a basketball game, exerting self-\ncontrol reduces individuals\u2019 capacity to exert\nmore self-control in a consequent task\u2014whether\nthat task is in the same domain (e.g., resisting a\ndonut and then continuing to eat healthy) or a\ndifferent one (e.g., resisting a donut and then\ncontinuing to be financially responsible;\nWillpower is limited. Trying to resist temptation now\nBaumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, & Tice, 1998;\ntakes energy and may leave you feeling like it's harder\nVohs & Heatherton, 2000). For example, in a\nto be disciplined later. You can only eat so many radishes\nstudy by Baumeister et al. (1998), research\n. . . [Photo: ghbrett]\nparticipants who forced themselves to eat\nradishes instead of tempting chocolates were subsequently less persistent (i.e., gave up\nsooner) at attempting an unsolvable puzzle task compared to the participants who had not\nexerted self-control to resist the chocolates.\nA Prerequisite to Self-Control: Identification\nAlthough factors such as resources and personal characteristics contribute to the successful\nexercise of self-control, identifying the self-control conflict inherent to a particular situation\nis an important\u2014and often overlooked\u2014prerequisite. For example, if you have a long-term\ngoal of getting better sleep but don\u2019t perceive that staying up late on a Friday night is\ninconsistent with this goal, you won\u2019t have a self-control conflict. The successful pursuit of a\ngoal in the face of temptation requires that individuals first identify they are having impulses Motives and Goals 225\nthat need to be controlled. However, individuals often fail to identify self-control conflicts\nbecause many everyday temptations seem to have very minimal negative consequences: one\nbowl of ice cream is unlikely to destroy a person\u2019s health, but what about 200 bowls of ice\ncream over the course of a few months?\nPeople are more likely to identify a self-control conflict, and exercise self-control, when they\nthink of a choice as part of a broader pattern of repeated behavior rather than as an isolated\nchoice. For example, rather than seeing one bowl of ice cream as an isolated behavioral\ndecision, the person should try to recognize that this \u201cone bowl of ice cream\u201d is actually part\nof a nightly routine. Indeed, when considering broader decision patterns, consistent\ntemptations become more problematic for long-term interests (Rachlin, 2000; Read,\nLoewenstein, & Kalyanaraman, 1999). Moreover, conflict identification is more likely if people\nsee their current choices as similar to their future choices.\nSelf-Control Processes: Counteracting Temptation\nThe protection of a valued goal involves several cognitive and behavioral strategies ultimately\naimed at \u201ccounteracting\u201d the pull of temptations and pushing oneself toward goal-related\nalternatives (Fishbach & Trope, 2007). One such cognitive process involves decreasing the\nvalue of temptations and increasing the value of goal-consistent objects or actions. For\nexample, health-conscious individuals might tell themselves a sugary treat is less appealing\nthan a piece of fruit in order to direct their choice toward the latter. Other behavioral strategies\ninclude a precommitment to pursue goals and forgo temptation (e.g., leaving one\u2019s credit card\nat home before going to the mall), establishing rewards for goals and penalties for temptations,\nor physically approaching goals and distancing oneself from temptations (e.g., pushing away\na dessert plate). These self-control processes can benefit individuals\u2019 long-term interests,\neither consciously or without conscious awareness. Thus, at times, individuals automatically\nactivate goal-related thoughts in response to temptation, and inhibit temptation-related\nthoughts in the presence of goal cues (Fishbach, Friedman, & Kruglanski, 2003).\nConclusion\nPeople often make New Year\u2019s resolutions with the idea that attaining one\u2019s goals is simple:\n\u201cI just have to choose to eat healthier, right?\u201d However, after going through this module and\nlearning a social-cognitive approach to the main theories and findings on goals and motivation,\nwe see that even the most basic decisions take place within a much larger and more complex\nmental framework. From the principles of goal priming and how goals influence perceptions,\nfeelings, and actions, to the factors of self-regulation and self-control, we have learned the Motives and Goals 226\nphases, orientations, and fluctuations involved in the course of everyday goal pursuit. Looking\nback on prior goal failures, it may seem impossible to achieve some of our desires. But, through\nunderstanding our own mental representation of our goals (i.e., the values and expectancies\nbehind them), we can help cognitively modify our behavior to achieve our dreams. If you do,\nwho knows?\u2014maybe you will be the first person to step on Mars. Motives and Goals 227\nDiscussion Questions\n1. What is the difference between goal and motivation?\n2. What is the difference between self-regulation and self-control?\n3. How do positive and negative feelings inform goal pursuit in a cybernetic self-regulation\nprocess?\n4. Describe the characteristics of the deliberative mindset that allows individuals to decide\nbetween different goals. How might these characteristics hinder the implemental phase\nof self-regulation?\n5. You just read a module on \u201cGoals and Motivation,\u201d and you believe it is a sign of commitment\nto the goal of learning about social psychology. Define commitment in this context. How\nwould interpreting your efforts as a sign of commitment influence your motivation to read\nmore about social psychology? By contrast, how would interpreting your efforts as a sign\nof progress influence your motivation to read more?\n6. Mel and Alex are friends. Mel has a prevention focus self-regulatory orientation, whereas\nAlex has a promotion focus. They are both training for a marathon and are looking for\nmotivational posters to hang in their respective apartments. While shopping, they find a\nposter with the following Confucius quote: \u201cThe will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge\nto reach your full potential ... . These are the keys that will unlock the door to personal\nexcellence.\u201d Who is this poster more likely to help stay motivated for the marathon (Mel\nor Alex)? Why? Find or write a quote that might help the other friend.\n7. Give an example in which an individual fails to exercise self-control. What are some factors\nthat can cause such a self-control failure?

Chapter 9: Stress & Health 13\nThe Healthy Life\nEmily Hooker & Sarah Pressman\nOur emotions, thoughts, and behaviors play an important role in our health. Not only do they\ninfluence our day-to-day health practices, but they can also influence how our body functions.\nThis module provides an overview of health psychology, which is a field devoted to\nunderstanding the connections between psychology and health. Discussed here are examples\nof topics a health psychologist might study, including stress, psychosocial factors related to\nhealth and disease, how to use psychology to improve health, and the role of psychology in\nmedicine.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Describe basic terminology used in the field of health psychology.\n\u2022 Explain theoretical models of health, as well as the role of psychological stress in the\ndevelopment of disease.\n\u2022 Describe psychological factors that contribute to resilience and improved health.\n\u2022 Defend the relevance and importance of psychology to the field of medicine.\nWhat Is Health Psychology?\nToday, we face more chronic disease than ever before because we are living longer lives while\nalso frequently behaving in unhealthy ways. One example of a chronic disease is coronary\nheart disease (CHD): It is the number one cause of death worldwide (World Health\nOrganization, 2013). CHD develops slowly over time and typically appears midlife, but related The Healthy Life 235\nheart problems can persist for years after the original diagnosis or cardiovascular event. In\nmanaging illnesses that persist over time (other examples might include cancer, diabetes, and\nlong-term disability) many psychological factors will determine the progression of the ailment.\nFor example, do patients seek help when appropriate? Do they follow doctor\nrecommendations? Do they develop negative psychological symptoms due to lasting illness\n(e.g., depression)? Also important is that psychological factors can play a significant role in\nwho develops these diseases, the prognosis, and the nature of the symptoms related to the\nillness. Health psychology is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on\nthese very issues, or more specifically, the role of psychology in maintaining health, as well\nas preventing and treating illness.\nConsideration of how psychological\nand social factors influence health is\nespecially important today because\nmany of the leading causes of illness\nin developed countries are often\nattributed to psychological and\nbehavioral factors. In the case of CHD,\ndiscussed above, psychosocial factors,\nsuch as excessive stress, smoking,\nunhealthy eating habits, and some\npersonality traits can also lead to\nincreased risk of disease and worse\nHealth psychologists are helping people to adapt behaviors to avoid\nhealth outcomes. That being said,\ndisease, reduce stress, and improve overall health. [Photo: Adelphi Lab\nmany of these factors can be adjusted\nCenter]\nusing psychological techniques. For\nexample, clinical health psychologists can improve health practices like poor dietary choices\nand smoking, they can teach important stress reduction techniques, and they can help treat\npsychological disorders tied to poor health. Health psychology considers how the choices we\nmake, the behaviors we engage in, and even the emotions that we feel, can play an important\nrole in our overall health (Cohen & Herbert, 1996; Taylor, 2012).\nHealth psychology relies on the Biopsychosocial Model of Health. This model posits that\nbiology, psychology, and social factors are just as important in the development of disease as\nbiological causes (e.g., germs, viruses), which is consistent with the World Health Organization\n(1946) definition of health. This model replaces the older Biomedical Model of Health, which\nprimarily considers the physical, or pathogenic, factors contributing to illness. Thanks to\nadvances in medical technology, there is a growing understanding of the physiology underlying\nthe mind\u2013body connection, and in particular, the role that different feelings can have on our The Healthy Life 236\nbody\u2019s function. Health psychology researchers working in the fields of psychosomatic\nmedicine and psychoneuroimmunology, for example, are interested in understanding how\npsychological factors can \u201cget under the skin\u201d and influence our physiology in order to better\nunderstand how factors like stress can make us sick.\nStress And Health\nYou probably know exactly what it\u2019s like to feel stress, but what you may not know is that it\ncan objectively influence your health. Answers to questions like, \u201cHow stressed do you feel?\u201d\nor \u201cHow overwhelmed do you feel?\u201d can predict your likelihood of developing both minor\nillnesses as well as serious problems like future heart attack (Cohen, Janicki-Deverts, & Miller,\n2007). (Want to measure your own stress level? Check out the links at the end of the module.)\nTo understand how health psychologists study these types of associations, we will describe\none famous example of a stress and health study. Imagine that you are a research subject\nfor a moment. After you check into a hotel room as part of the study, the researchers ask you\nto report your general levels of stress. Not too surprising; however, what happens next is that\nyou receive droplets of cold virus into your nose! The researchers intentionally try to make\nyou sick by exposing you to an infectious illness. After they expose you to the virus, the\nresearchers will then evaluate you for several days by asking you questions about your\nFigure 1: Adapted from Cohen et al. 1991 The Healthy Life 237\nsymptoms, monitoring how much mucus you are producing by weighing your used tissues,\nand taking body fluid samples\u2014all to see if you are objectively ill with a cold. Now, the\ninteresting thing is that not everyone who has drops of cold virus put in their nose develops\nthe illness. Studies like this one find that people who are less stressed and those who are\nmore positive at the beginning of the study are at a decreased risk of developing a cold (Cohen,\nTyrrell, & Smith, 1991; Cohen, Alper, Doyle, Treanor, & Turner, 2006) (see Figure 1 for an\nexample).\nImportantly, it is not just major life stressors (e.g., a family death, a natural disaster) that\nincrease the likelihood of getting sick. Even small daily hassles like getting stuck in traffic or\nfighting with your girlfriend can raise your blood pressure, alter your stress hormones, and\neven suppress your immune system function (DeLongis, Folkman, & Lazarus, 1988; Twisk,\nSnel, Kemper, & van Machelen, 1999).\nIt is clear that stress plays a major role in our mental and physical health, but what exactly is\nit? The term stress was originally derived from the field of mechanics where it is used to\ndescribe materials under pressure. The word was first used in a psychological manner by\nresearcher Hans Selye. He was examining the effect of an ovarian hormone that he thought\ncaused sickness in a sample of rats. Surprisingly, he noticed that almost any injected hormone\nproduced this same sickness. He smartly realized that it was not the hormone under\ninvestigation that was causing these problems, but instead, the aversive experience of being\nhandled and injected by researchers that led to high physiological arousal and, eventually, to\nhealth problems like ulcers. Selye (1946) coined the term stressor to label a stimulus that had\nthis effect on the body and developed a model of the stress response called the General\nAdaptation Syndrome. Since then, psychologists have studied stress in a myriad of ways,\nincluding stress as negative events (e.g., natural disasters or major life changes like dropping\nout of school), as chronically difficult situations (e.g., taking care of a loved one with\nAlzheimer\u2019s), as short-term hassles, as a biological fight-or-flight response, and even as clinical\nillness like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It continues to be one of the most important\nand well-studied psychological correlates of illness, because excessive stress causes\npotentially damaging wear and tear on the body and can influence almost any imaginable\ndisease process.\nProtecting Our Health\nAn important question that health psychologists ask is: What keeps us protected from disease\nand alive longer? When considering this issue of resilience (Rutter, 1985), five factors are\noften studied in terms of their ability to protect (or sometimes harm) health. They are: The Healthy Life 238\n1. Coping\n2. Control and Self-Efficacy\n3. Social Relationships\n4. Dispositions and Emotions\n5. Stress Management\nCoping Strategies\nHow individuals cope with the stressors they face can have a significant impact on health.\nCoping is often classified into two categories: problem-focused coping or emotion-focused\ncoping (Carver, Scheier, & Weintraub, 1989). Problem-focused coping is thought of as actively\naddressing the event that is causing stress in an effort to solve the issue at hand. For example,\nsay you have an important exam coming up next week. A problem-focused strategy might\nbe to spend additional time over the weekend studying to make sure you understand all of\nthe material. Emotion-focused coping, on the other hand, regulates the emotions that come\nwith stress. In the above examination example, this might mean watching a funny movie to\ntake your mind off the anxiety you are feeling. In the short term, emotion-focused coping\nmight reduce feelings of stress, but problem-focused coping seems to have the greatest impact\non mental wellness (Billings & Moos, 1981; Herman-Stabl, Stemmler, & Petersen, 1995). That\nbeing said, when events are uncontrollable (e.g., the death of a loved one), emotion-focused\ncoping directed at managing your feelings, at first, might be the better strategy. Therefore, it\nis always important to consider the match of the stressor to the coping strategy when\nevaluating its plausible benefits.\nControl and Self-Efficacy\nAnother factor tied to better health outcomes and an improved ability to cope with stress is\nhaving the belief that you have control over a situation. For example, in one study where\nparticipants were forced to listen to unpleasant (stressful) noise, those who were led to believe\nthat they had control over the noise performed much better on proofreading tasks afterwards\n(Glass & Singer, 1972). In other words, even though participants did not have actual control\nover the noise, the control belief aided them in completing the task. In similar studies,\nperceived control benefited immune system functioning (Sieber et al., 1992). Outside of the\nlaboratory, studies have shown that older residents in assisted living facilities, which are\nnotorious for low control, lived longer and showed better health outcomes when given control\nover something as simple as watering a plant or choosing when student volunteers came to The Healthy Life 239\nvisit (Rodin & Langer, 1977; Schulz & Hanusa,\n1978). In addition, feeling in control of a\nthreatening situation can actually change stress\nhormone levels (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004).\nBelieving that you have control over your own\nbehaviors can also have a positive influence on\nimportant outcomes like smoking cessation,\ncontraception use, and weight management\n(Wallston & Wallston, 1978). When individuals\ndo not believe they have control, they do not try\nto change. Self-efficacy is closely related to\ncontrol, in that people with high levels of this\ntrait believe they can complete tasks and reach\ntheir goals. Just as feeling in control can reduce\nstress and improve health, higher self-efficacy\ncan reduce stress and negative health\nbehaviors, and is associated with better health\n(O\u2019Leary, 1985).\nFeeling a sense of control in one's life is important. Social Relationships\nSomething as simple as having control over the care of a\nhouseplant has been shown to improve health and\nlongevity. [Photo: Vicburton] Research has shown that the impact of social\nisolation on our risk for disease and death is\nsimilar in magnitude to the risk associated with smoking regularly (Holt-Lunstad, Smith, &\nLayton, 2010; House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). In fact, the importance of social relationships\nfor our health is so significant that some scientists believe our body has developed a\nphysiological system that encourages us to seek out our relationships, especially in times of\nstress (Taylor et al., 2000). Social integration is the concept used to describe the number of\nsocial roles that you have (Cohen & Wills, 1985), as well as the lack of isolation. For example,\nyou might be a daughter, a basketball team member, a Humane Society volunteer, a coworker,\nand a student. Maintaining these different roles can improve your health via encouragement\nfrom those around you to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Those in your social network might\nalso provide you with social support (e.g., when you are under stress). This support might\ninclude emotional help (e.g., a hug when you need it), tangible help (e.g., lending you money),\nor advice. By helping to improve health behaviors and reduce stress, social relationships can\nhave a powerful, protective impact on health, and in some cases, might even help people with\nserious illnesses stay alive longer (Spiegel, Kraemer, Bloom, & Gottheil, 1989). The Healthy Life 240\nDispositions and Emotions: What\u2019s Risky and What\u2019s Protective?\nNegative dispositions and personality traits have been strongly tied to an array of health risks.\nOne of the earliest negative trait-to-health connections was discovered in the 1950s by two\ncardiologists. They made the interesting discovery that there were common behavioral and\npsychological patterns among their heart patients that were not present in other patient\nsamples. This pattern included being competitive, impatient, hostile, and time urgent. They\nlabeled it Type A Behavior. Importantly, it was found to be associated with double the risk of\nheart disease as compared with Type B Behavior (Friedman & Rosenman, 1959). Since the\n1950s, researchers have discovered that it is the hostility and competitiveness components\nof Type A that are especially harmful to heart health (Iribarren et al., 2000; Matthews, Glass,\nRosenman, & Bortner, 1977; Miller, Smith, Turner, Guijarro, & Hallet, 1996). Hostile individuals\nare quick to get upset, and this angry arousal can damage the arteries of the heart. In addition,\ngiven their negative personality style, hostile people often lack a heath-protective supportive\nsocial network.\nPositive traits and states, on the other hand, are often health protective. For example,\ncharacteristics like positive emotions (e.g., feeling happy or excited) have been tied to a wide\nrange of benefits such as increased longevity, a reduced likelihood of developing some\nillnesses, and better outcomes once you are diagnosed with certain diseases (e.g., heart\ndisease, HIV) (Pressman & Cohen, 2005). Across the world, even in the most poor and\nunderdeveloped nations, positive emotions are consistently tied to better health (Pressman,\nGallagher, & Lopez, 2013). Positive emotions can also serve as the \u201cantidote\u201d to stress,\nprotecting us against some of its damaging effects (Fredrickson, 2001; Pressman & Cohen,\n2005; see Figure 2). Similarly, looking on the bright side can also improve health. Optimism\nhas been shown to improve coping, reduce stress, and predict better disease outcomes like\nrecovering from a heart attack more rapidly (Kubzansky, Sparrow, Vokonas, & Kawachi, 2001;\nNes & Segerstrom, 2006; Scheier & Carver, 1985; Segerstrom, Taylor, Kemeny, & Fahey, 1998).\nStress Management\nAbout 20 percent of Americans report having stress, with 18\u201333 year-olds reporting the highest\nlevels (American Psychological Association, 2012). Given that the sources of our stress are\noften difficult to change (e.g., personal finances, current job), a number of interventions have\nbeen designed to help reduce the aversive responses to duress. For example, relaxation\nactivities and forms of meditation are techniques that allow individuals to reduce their stress\nvia breathing exercises, muscle relaxation, and mental imagery. Physiological arousal from\nstress can also be reduced via biofeedback, a technique where the individual is shown bodily The Healthy Life 241\ninformation that is not normally\navailable to them (e.g., heart rate), and\nthen taught strategies to alter this signal.\nThis type of intervention has even shown\npromise in reducing heart and hypertension\nrisk, as well as other serious conditions\n(e.g., Moravec, 2008; Patel, Marmot, &\nTerry, 1981). But reducing stress does not\nhave to be complicated! For example,\nexercise is a great stress reduction\nactivity (Salmon, 2001) that has a myriad\nof health benefits.\nThe Importance Of Good\nHealth Practices\nFigure 2. This figure illustrates one possible way that positive affect\nAs a student, you probably strive to\nprotects individuals against disease. Positive affect can reduce\nmaintain good grades, to have an active\nstress perceptions (a), thereby improving health behaviors (b) and\nsocial life, and to stay healthy (e.g., by\nlowering physiological stress responses (c) (e.g., decreased\ngetting enough sleep), but there is a cardiovascular reactivity, lower stress hormones, non-suppressed\npopular joke about what it\u2019s like to be in immune activity). As a result, there is likely to be less incidence of\ncollege: you can only pick two of these disease (d, e). (Adapted from Pressman & Cohen, 2005)\nthings (see Figure 3 for an example). The\nbusy life of a college student doesn\u2019t always allow you to maintain all three areas of your life,\nespecially during test-taking periods. In one study, researchers found that students taking\nexams were more stressed and, thus, smoked more, drank more caffeine, had less physical\nactivity, and had worse sleep habits (Oaten & Chang, 2005), all of which could have detrimental\neffects on their health. Positive health practices are especially important in times of stress\nwhen your immune system is compromised due to high stress and the elevated frequency of\nexposure to the illnesses of your fellow students in lecture halls, cafeterias, and dorms.\nPsychologists study both health behaviors and health habits. The former are behaviors that\ncan improve or harm your health. Some examples include regular exercise, flossing, and\nwearing sunscreen, versus negative behaviors like drunk driving, pulling all-nighters, or\nsmoking. These behaviors become habits when they are firmly established and performed\nautomatically. For example, do you have to think about putting your seatbelt on or do you\ndo it automatically? Habits are often developed early in life thanks to parental encouragement\nor the influence of our peer group. The Healthy Life 242\nFigure 3: A popular joke about how difficult it is to stay balanced and healthy during college.\nWhile these behaviors sound minor, studies have shown that those who engaged in more of\nthese protective habits (e.g., getting 7\u20138 hours of sleep regularly, not smoking or drinking\nexcessively, exercising) had fewer illnesses, felt better, and were less likely to die over a 9\u201312-\nyear follow-up period (Belloc & Breslow 1972; Breslow & Enstrom 1980). For college students,\nhealth behaviors can even influence academic performance. For example, poor sleep quality\nand quantity are related to weaker learning capacity and academic performance (Curcio,\nFerrara, & De Gennaro, 2006). Due to the effects that health behaviors can have, much effort\nis put forward by psychologists to understand how to change unhealthy behaviors, and to\nunderstand why individuals fail to act in healthy ways. Health promotion involves enabling\nindividuals to improve health by focusing on behaviors that pose a risk for future illness, as\nwell as spreading knowledge on existing risk factors. These might be genetic risks you are\nborn with, or something you developed over time like obesity, which puts you at risk for Type\n2 diabetes and heart disease, among other illnesses.\nPsychology And Medicine\nThere are many psychological factors that influence medical treatment outcomes. For\nexample, older individuals, (Meara, White, & Cutler, 2004), women (Briscoe, 1987), and those\nfrom higher socioeconomic backgrounds (Adamson, Ben-Shlomo, Chaturvedi, & Donovan,\n2008) are all more likely to seek medical care. On the other hand, some individuals who need The Healthy Life 243\ncare might avoid it due to\nfinancial obstacles or preconceived\nnotions about medical practitioners\nor the illness. Thanks to the\ngrowing amount of medical\ninformation online, many people\nnow use the Internet for health\ninformation and 38% percent\nreport that this influences their\ndecision to see a doctor (Fox &\nJones, 2009). Unfortunately,\nthis is not always a good thing\nWhile the internet has increased the amount of medical information available\nbecause individuals tend to do\nto the public and created greater access there are real concerns about how\na poor job assessing the\npeople are making decisions about their health based on that information.\ncredibility of health information.\n[Photo: jfcherry]\nFor example, college-student\nparticipants reading online articles about HIV and syphilis rated a physician\u2019s article and a\ncollege student\u2019s article as equally credible if the participants said they were familiar with the\nhealth topic (Eastin, 2001). Credibility of health information often means how accurate or\ntrustworthy the information is, and it can be influenced by irrelevant factors, such as the\nwebsite\u2019s design, logos, or the organization\u2019s contact information (Freeman & Spyridakis,\n2004). Similarly, many people post health questions on online, unmoderated forums where\nanyone can respond, which allows for the possibility of inaccurate information being provided\nfor serious medical conditions by unqualified individuals.\nAfter individuals decide to seek care, there is also variability in the information they give their\nmedical provider. Poor communication (e.g., due to embarrassment or feeling rushed) can\ninfluence the accuracy of the diagnosis and the effectiveness of the prescribed treatment.\nSimilarly, there is variation following a visit to the doctor. While most individuals are tasked\nwith a health recommendation (e.g., buying and using a medication appropriately, losing\nweight, going to another expert), not everyone adheres to medical recommendations (Dunbar-\nJacob & Mortimer-Stephens, 2010). For example, many individuals take medications\ninappropriately (e.g., stopping early, not filling prescriptions) or fail to change their behaviors\n(e.g., quitting smoking). Unfortunately, getting patients to follow medical orders is not as easy\nas one would think. For example, in one study, over one third of diabetic patients failed to\nget proper medical care that would prevent or slow down diabetes-related blindness\n(Schoenfeld, Greene, Wu, & Leske, 2001)! Fortunately, as mobile technology improves,\nphysicians now have the ability to monitor adherence and work to improve it (e.g., with pill\nbottles that monitor if they are opened at the right time). Even text messages are useful for The Healthy Life 244\nimproving treatment adherence and outcomes in depression, smoking cessation, and weight\nloss (Cole-Lewis, & Kershaw, 2010).\nBeing A Health Psychologist\nTraining as a clinical health psychologist provides a variety of possible career options. Clinical\nhealth psychologists often work on teams of physicians, social workers, allied health\nprofessionals, and religious leaders. These teams may be formed in locations like\nrehabilitation centers, hospitals, primary care offices, emergency care centers, or in chronic\nillness clinics. Work in each of these settings will pose unique challenges in patient care, but\nthe primary responsibility will be the same. Clinical health psychologists will evaluate physical,\npersonal, and environmental factors contributing to illness and preventing improved health.\nIn doing so, they will then help create a treatment strategy that takes into account all\ndimensions of a person\u2019s life and health, which maximizes its potential for success. Those\nwho specialize in health psychology can also conduct research to discover new health\npredictors and risk factors, or develop interventions to prevent and treat illness. Researchers\nstudying health psychology work in numerous locations, such as universities, public health\ndepartments, hospitals, and private organizations. In the related field of behavioral medicine,\ncareers focus on the application of this type of research. Occupations in this area might\ninclude jobs in occupational therapy, rehabilitation, or preventative medicine. Training as a\nhealth psychologist provides a wide skill set applicable in a number of different professional\nsettings and career paths.\nThe Future Of Health Psychology\nMuch of the past medical research literature provides an incomplete picture of human health.\n\u201cHealth care\u201d is often \u201cillness care.\u201d That is, it focuses on the management of symptoms and\nillnesses as they arise. As a result, in many developed countries, we are faced with several\nhealth epidemics that are difficult and costly to treat. These include obesity, diabetes, and\ncardiovascular disease, to name a few. The National Institutes of Health have called for\nresearchers to use the knowledge we have about risk factors to design effective interventions\nto reduce the prevalence of preventable illness. Additionally, there are a growing number of\nindividuals across developed countries with multiple chronic illnesses and/or lasting\ndisabilities, especially with older age. Addressing their needs and maintaining their quality\nof life will require skilled individuals who understand how to properly treat these populations.\nHealth psychologists will be on the forefront of work in these areas.\nWith this focus on prevention, it is important that health psychologists move beyond studying The Healthy Life 245\nrisk (e.g., depression, stress, hostility, low socioeconomic status) in isolation, and move toward\nstudying factors that confer resilience and protection from disease. There is, fortunately, a\ngrowing interest in studying the positive factors that protect our health (e.g., Diener & Chan,\n2011; Pressman & Cohen, 2005; Richman, Kubzansky, Maselko, Kawachi, Choo, & Bauer, 2005)\nwith evidence strongly indicating that people with higher positivity live longer, suffer fewer\nillnesses, and generally feel better. Seligman (2008) has even proposed a field of \u201cPositive\nHealth\u201d to specifically study those who exhibit \u201cabove average\u201d health\u2014something we do not\nthink about enough. By shifting some of the research focus to identifying and understanding\nthese health-promoting factors, we may capitalize on this information to improve public\nhealth.\nInnovative interventions to improve health are already in use and continue to be studied.\nWith recent advances in technology, we are starting to see great strides made to improve\nhealth with the aid of computational tools. For example, there are hundreds of simple\napplications (apps) that use email and text messages to send reminders to take medication,\nas well as mobile apps that allow us to monitor our exercise levels and food intake (in the\ngrowing mobile-health, or m-health, field). These m-health applications can be used to raise\nhealth awareness, support treatment and compliance, and remotely collect data on a variety\nof outcomes. Also exciting are devices that allow us to monitor physiology in real time; for\nexample, to better understand the stressful situations that raise blood pressure or heart rate.\nWith advances like these, health psychologists will be able to serve the population better,\nlearn more about health and health behavior, and develop excellent health-improving\nstrategies that could be specifically targeted to certain populations or individuals. These leaps\nin equipment development, partnered with growing health psychology knowledge and\nexciting advances in neuroscience and genetic research, will lead health researchers and\npractitioners into an exciting new time where, hopefully, we will understand more and more\nabout how to keep people healthy.

The\ndevelopment of assessments to measure this concept is at the core of the development of\npsychological science itself. This module introduces key historical figures, major theories of\nintelligence, and common assessment strategies related to intelligence. This module will also\ndiscuss controversies related to the study of group differences in intelligence.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 List at least two common strategies for measuring intelligence.\n\u2022 Name at least one \u201ctype\u201d of intelligence.\n\u2022 Define intelligence in simple terms.\n\u2022 Explain the controversy relating to differences in intelligence between groups.\nIntroduction\nEvery year hundreds of grade school students converge on Washington, D.C., for the annual\nScripps National Spelling Bee. The \u201cbee\u201d is an elite event in which children as young as 8 square\noff to spell words like \u201ccymotrichous\u201d and \u201cappoggiatura.\u201d Most people who watch the bee\nthink of these kids as being \u201csmart\u201d and you likely agree with this description.\nWhat makes a person intelligent? Is it heredity (two of the 2014 contestants in the bee have\nsiblings who have previously won)(National Spelling Bee, 2014a)? Is it interest (the most Intelligence 256\nfrequently listed favorite subject among\nspelling bee competitors is math)(NSB,\n2014b)? In this unit we will cover these and\nother fascinating aspects of intelligence.\nBy the end of the unit you should be able\nto define intelligence and discuss some\ncommon strategies for measuring intelligence.\nIn addition, we will tackle the politically\nthorny issue of whether there are\ndifferences in intelligence between\nA participant in the Scripps National Spelling Bee. [Photo:\ngroups such as men and women.\nScrippsBee]\nDefining and Measuring Intelligence\nWhen you think of \u201csmart people\u201d you likely have an intuitive sense of the qualities that make\nthem intelligent. Maybe you think they have a good memory, or that they can think quickly,\nor that they simply know a whole lot of information. Indeed, people who exhibit such qualities\nappear very intelligent. That said, it seems that intelligence must be more than simply knowing\nfacts and being able to remember them. One point in favor of this argument is the idea of\nanimal intelligence. It will come as no surprise to you that a dog, which can learn commands\nand tricks seems smarter than a snake that cannot. In fact, researchers and lay people\ngenerally agree with one another that primates\u2014monkeys and apes (including humans)\u2014are\namong the most intelligent animals. Apes such as chimpanzees are capable of complex\nproblem solving and sophisticated communication (Kohler, 1924).\nScientists point to the social nature of primates as one evolutionary source of their intelligence.\nPrimates live together in troops or family groups and are, therefore, highly social creatures.\nAs such, primates tend to have brains that are better developed for communication and long\nterm thinking than most other animals. For instance, the complex social environment has led\nprimates to develop deception, altruism, numerical concepts, and \u201ctheory of mind\u201d (a sense\nof the self as a unique individual separate from others in the group; Gallup, 1982; Hauser,\nMacNeilage & Ware, 1996).[Also see Noba unit Theory of Mind http://noba.to/a8wpytg3]\nThe question of what constitutes human intelligence is one of the oldest inquiries in\npsychology. When we talk about intelligence we typically mean intellectual ability. This broadly\nencompasses the ability to learn, remember and use new information, to solve problems and\nto adapt to novel situations. An early scholar of intelligence, Charles Spearman, proposed the\nidea that intelligence was one thing, a \u201cgeneral factor\u201d sometimes known as simply \u201cg.\u201d He Intelligence 257\nbased this conclusion on the observation that people who perform well in one intellectual\narea such as verbal ability also tend to perform well in other areas such as logic and reasoning\n(Spearman, 1904).\nA contemporary of Spearman\u2019s named Francis Galton\u2014himself a cousin of Charles Darwin--\nwas among those who pioneered psychological measurement (Hunt, 2009). For three pence\nGalton would measure various physical characteristics such as grip strength but also some\npsychological attributes such as the ability to judge distance or discriminate between colors.\nThis is an example of one of the earliest systematic measures of individual ability. Galton was\nparticularly interested in intelligence, which he thought was heritable in much the same way\nthat height and eye color are. He conceived of several rudimentary methods for assessing\nwhether his hypothesis was true. For example, he carefully tracked the family tree of the top-\nscoring Cambridge students over the previous 40 years. Although he found specific families\ndisproportionately produced top scholars, intellectual achievement could still be the product\nof economic status, family culture or other non-genetic factors. Galton was also, possibly, the\nfirst to popularize the idea that the heritability of psychological traits could be studied by\nlooking at identical and fraternal twins. Although his methods were crude by modern\nstandards, Galton established intelligence as a variable that could be measured (Hunt, 2009).\nThe person best known for formally pioneering the\nmeasurement of intellectual ability is Alfred Binet. Like\nGalton, Binet was fascinated by individual differences in\nintelligence. For instance, he blindfolded chess players and\nsaw that some of them had the ability to continue playing\nusing only their memory to keep the many positions of the\npieces in mind (Binet, 1894). Binet was particularly\ninterested in the development of intelligence, a fascination\nthat led him to observe children carefully in the classroom\nsetting.\nAlong with his colleague Theodore Simon, Binet created a\ntest of children\u2019s intellectual capacity. They created\nindividual test items that should be answerable by children Intelligence research pioneer Alfred Binet\nof given ages. For instance, a child who is three should be [Photo: wikimedia commons]\nable to point to her mouth and eyes, a child who is nine\nshould be able to name the months of the year in order, and a twelve year old ought to be\nable to name sixty words in three minutes. Their assessment became the first \u201cIQ test.\u201d\n\u201cIQ\u201d or \u201cintelligence quotient\u201d is a name given to the score of the Binet-Simon test. The score Intelligence 258\nTable 1: Examples of the types of items you might see on an intelligence test.\nis derived by dividing a child\u2019s mental age (the score from the test) by their chronological age\nto create an overall quotient. These days, the phrase \u201cIQ\u201d does not apply specifically to the\nBinet-Simon test and is used to generally denote intelligence or a score on any intelligence\ntest. In the early 1900s the Binet-Simon test was adapted by a Stanford professor named Intelligence 259\nLewis Terman to create what is, perhaps, the most famous intelligence test in the world, the\nStanford-Binet (Terman, 1916). The major advantage of this new test was that it was\nstandardized. Based on a large sample of children Terman was able to plot the scores in a\nnormal distribution, shaped like a \u201cbell curve\u201d (see Fig. 1). To understand a normal distribution\nthink about the height of people. Most people are average in height with relatively fewer being\ntall or short, and fewer still being extremely tall or extremely short. Terman (1916) laid out\nintelligence scores in exactly the same way, allowing for easy and reliable categorizations and\ncomparisons between individuals.\nFigure 1: Bell Curve - Normal Distribution IQ\nLooking at another modern intelligence test\u2014the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)\u2014\ncan provide clues to a definition of intelligence itself. Motivated by several criticisms of the\nStanford-Binet test, psychologist David Wechsler sought to create a superior measure of\nintelligence. He was critical of the way that the Stanford-Binet relied so heavily on verbal ability\nand was also suspicious of using a single score to capture all of intelligence. To address these\nissues Wechsler created a test that tapped a wide range of intellectual abilities. This\nunderstanding of intelligence\u2014that it is made up of a pool of specific abilities\u2014is a notable\ndeparture from Spearman\u2019s concept of general intelligence. The WAIS assesses people's ability\nto remember, compute, understand language, reason well, and process information quickly\n(Wechsler, 1955). Intelligence 260\nOne interesting by-product of measuring intelligence for so many years is that we can chart\nchanges over time. It might seem strange to you that intelligence can change over the decades\nbut that appears to have happened over the last 80 years we have been measuring this topic.\nHere\u2019s how we know: IQ tests have an average score of 100. When new waves of people are\nasked to take older tests they tend to outperform the original sample from years ago on which\nthe test was normed. This gain is known as the \u201cFlynn Effect,\u201d named after James Flynn, the\nresearcher who first identified it (Flynn, 1987). Several hypotheses have been put forth to\nexplain the Flynn Effect including better nutrition (healthier brains!), greater familiarity with\ntesting in general, and more exposure to visual stimuli. Today, there is no perfect agreement\namong psychological researchers with regards to the causes of increases in average scores\non intelligence tests. Perhaps if you choose a career in psychology you will be the one to\ndiscover the answer!\nTypes of Intelligence\nDavid Wechsler\u2019s approach to testing intellectual ability was based on the fundamental idea\nthat there are, in essence, many aspects to intelligence. Other scholars have echoed this idea\nby going so far as to suggest that there are actually even different types of intelligence. You\nlikely have heard distinctions made between \u201cstreet smarts\u201d and \u201cbook learning.\u201d The former\nrefers to practical wisdom accumulated through experience while the latter indicates formal\neducation. A person high in street smarts might have a superior ability to catch a person in a\nlie, to persuade others, or to think quickly under pressure. A person high in book learning, by\ncontrast, might have a large vocabulary and be able to remember a large number of references\nto classic novels. Although psychologists don\u2019t use street smarts or book smarts as\nprofessional terms they do believe that intelligence comes in different types.\nThere are many ways to parse apart the concept of intelligence. Many scholars believe that\nCarroll \u2018s (1993) review of more than 400 data sets provides the best currently existing single\nsource for organizing various concepts related to intelligence. Carroll divided intelligence into\nthree levels, or strata, descending from the most abstract down to the most specific (see Fig.\n2). To understand this way of categorizing simply think of a \u201ccar.\u201d Car is a general word that\ndenotes all types of motorized vehicles. At the more specific level under \u201ccar\u201d might be various\ntypes of cars such as sedans, sports cars, SUVs, pick-up trucks, station wagons, and so forth.\nMore specific still would be certain models of each such as a Honda Civic or Ferrari Enzo. In\nthe same manner, Carroll called the highest level (stratum III) the general intelligence factor\n\u201cg.\u201d Under this were more specific stratum II categories such as fluid intelligence and visual\nperception and processing speed. Each of these, in turn, can be sub-divided into very specific\ncomponents such as spatial scanning, reaction time, and word fluency. Intelligence 261\nThinking of intelligence as Carroll (1993) does, as a collection of specific mental abilities, has\nhelped researchers conceptualize this topic in new ways. For example, Horn and Cattell (1966)\ndistinguish between \u201cfluid\u201d and \u201ccrystalized\u201d intelligence, both of which show up on stratum\nII of Carroll\u2019s model. Fluid intelligence is the ability to \u201cthink on your feet;\u201d that is, to solve\nproblems. Crystalized intelligence, on the other hand, is the ability to use language, skills and\nexperience to address problems. The former is associated more with youth while the latter\nincreases with age. You may have noticed the way in which younger people can adapt to new\nsituations and use trial and error to quickly figure out solutions. By contrast, older people\ntend to rely on their relatively superior store of knowledge to solve problems.\nFigure 2: Caroll's Model of Intelligence\nHarvard professor Howard Gardner is another figure in psychology who is well-known for\nchampioning the notion that there are different types of intelligence. Gardner\u2019s theory is\nappropriately, called \u201cmultiple intelligences.\u201d Gardner\u2019s theory is based on the idea that people\nprocess information through different \u201cchannels\u201d and these are relatively independent of one\nanother. He has identified 8 common intelligences including 1) logic-math, 2) visual-spatial,\n3) music-rhythm, 4) verbal-linguistic, 5) bodily-kinesthetic, 6) interpersonal, 7) intrapersonal,\nand 8) naturalistic (Gardner, 1985). Many people are attracted to Gardner\u2019s theory because it\nsuggests that people each learn in unique ways. There are now many Gardner- influenced Intelligence 262\nschools in the world.\nAnother type of intelligence is Emotional intelligence. Unlike traditional models of intelligence\nthat emphasize cognition (thinking) the idea of emotional intelligence emphasizes the\nexperience and expression of emotion. Some researchers argue that emotional intelligence\nis a set of skills in which an individual can accurately understand the emotions of others, can\nidentify and label their own emotions, and can use emotions. (Mayer & Salovey, 1997). Other\nresearchers believe that emotional intelligence is a mixture of abilities, such as stress\nmanagement, and personality, such as a person\u2019s predisposition for certain moods (Bar-On,\n2006). Regardless of the specific definition of emotional intelligence, studies have shown a\nlink between this concept and job performance (Lopes, Grewal, Kadis, Gall, & Salovey, 2006).\nIn fact, emotional intelligence is similar to more traditional notions of cognitive intelligence\nwith regards to workplace benefits. Schmidt and Hunter (1998), for example, reviewed\nresearch on intelligence in the workplace context and show that intelligence is the single best\npredictor of doing well in job training programs, of learning on the job. They also report that\ngeneral intelligence is moderately correlated with all types of jobs but especially with\nmanagerial and complex, technical jobs.\nThere is one last point that is important to bear in mind about intelligence. It turns out that\nthe way an individual thinks about his or her own intelligence is also important because it\npredicts performance. Researcher Carol Dweck has made a career out of looking at the\ndifferences between high IQ children who perform well and those who do not, so-called \u201cunder\nachievers.\u201d Among her most interesting findings is that it is not gender or social class that sets\napart the high and low performers. Instead, it is their mindset. The children who believe that\ntheir abilities in general\u2014and their intelligence specifically\u2014is a fixed trait tend to\nunderperform. By contrast, kids who believe that intelligence is changeable and evolving tend\nto handle failure better and perform better (Dweck, 1986). Dweck refers to this as a person\u2019s\n\u201cmindset\u201d and having a growth mindset appears to be healthier.\nCorrelates of Intelligence\nThe research on mindset is interesting but there can also be a temptation to interpret it as\nsuggesting that every human has an unlimited potential for intelligence and that becoming\nsmarter is only a matter of positive thinking. There is some evidence that genetics is an\nimportant factor in the intelligence equation. For instance, a number of studies on genetics\nin adults have yielded the result that intelligence is largely, but not totally, inherited\n(Bouchard,2004).Having a healthy attitude about the nature of smarts and working hard can\nboth definitely help intellectual performance but it also helps to have the genetic leaning Intelligence 263\ntoward intelligence.\nCarol Dweck\u2019s research on the mindset of children also brings one of the most interesting and\ncontroversial issues surrounding intelligence research to the fore: group differences. From\nthe very beginning of the study of intelligence researchers have wondered about differences\nbetween groups of people such as men and women. With regards to potential differences\nbetween the sexes some people have noticed that women are under-represented in certain\nfields. In 1976, for example, women comprised just 1% of all faculty members in engineering\n(Ceci, Williams & Barnett, 2009).\nEven today women make up between\n3% and 15% of all faculty in math-\nintensive fields at the 50 top\nuniversities. This phenomenon could\nbe explained in many ways: it might\nbe the result of inequalities in the\neducational system, it might be due to\ndifferences in socialization wherein\nyoung girls are encouraged to develop\nother interests, it might be the result\nof that women are\u2014on average\u2014\nresponsible for a larger portion of\nWomen account for a disproportionately small percentage of those\nchildcare obligations and therefore\nemployed in math-intensive career fields such as engineering. [Photo:\nmake different types of professional\nArgonne National Laboratory]\ndecisions, or it might be due to innate\ndifferences between these groups, to name just a few possibilities. The possibility of innate\ndifferences is the most controversial because many people see it as either the product of or\nthe foundation for sexism. In today\u2019s political landscape it is easy to see that asking certain\nquestions such as \u201care men smarter than women?\u201d would be inflammatory. In a\ncomprehensive review of research on intellectual abilities and sex Ceci and colleagues (2009)\nargue against the hypothesis that biological and genetic differences account for much of the\nsex differences in intellectual ability. Instead, they believe that a complex web of influences\nranging from societal expectations to test taking strategies to individual interests account for\nmany of the sex differences found in math and similar intellectual abilities.\nA more interesting question, and perhaps a more sensitive one, might be to inquire in which\nways men and women might differ in intellectual ability, if at all. That is, researchers should\nnot seek to prove that one group or another is better but might examine the ways that they\nmight differ and offer explanations for any differences that are found. Researchers have Intelligence 264\ninvestigated sex differences in intellectual ability. In a review of the research literature Halpern\n(1997) found that women appear, on average, superior to men on measures of fine motor\nskill, acquired knowledge, reading comprehension, decoding non-verbal expression, and\ngenerally have higher grades in school. Men, by contrast, appear, on average, superior to\nwomen on measures of fluid reasoning related to math and science, perceptual tasks that\ninvolve moving objects, and tasks that require transformations in working memory such as\nmental rotations of physical spaces. Halpern also notes that men are disproportionately\nrepresented on the low end of cognitive functioning including in mental retardation, dyslexia,\nand attention deficit disorders (Halpern, 1997).\nOther researchers have examined various explanatory hypotheses for why sex differences in\nintellectual ability occur. Some studies have provided mixed evidence for genetic factors while\nothers point to evidence for social factors (Neisser, et al, 1996; Nisbett, et al., 2012). One\ninteresting phenomenon that has received research scrutiny is the idea of stereotype threat.\nStereotype threat is the idea that mental access to a particular stereotype can have real-world\nimpact on a member of the stereotyped group. In one study (Spencer, Steele, & Quinn, 1999),\nfor example, women who were informed that women tend to fare poorly on math exams just\nbefore taking a math test actually performed worse relative to a control group who did not\nhear the stereotype. One possible antidote to stereotype threat, at least in the case of women,\nis to make a self-affirmation (such as listing positive personal qualities) before the threat\noccurs. In one study, for instance, Martens and her colleagues (2006) had women write about\npersonal qualities that they valued before taking a math test. The affirmation largely erased\nthe effect of stereotype by improving math scores for women relative to a control group but\nsimilar affirmations had little effect for men (Martens, Johns, Greenberg, & Schimel, 2006).\nThese types of controversies compel many lay people to wonder if there might be a problem\nwith intelligence measures. It is natural to wonder if they are somehow biased against certain\ngroups. Psychologists typically answer such questions by pointing out that bias in the testing\nsense of the word is different than how people use the word in everyday speech. Common\nuse of bias denotes a prejudice based on group membership. Scientific bias, on the other\nhand, is related to the psychometric properties of the test such as validity and reliability.\nValidity is the idea that an assessment measures what it claims to measure and that it can\npredict future behaviors or performance. To this end, intelligence tests are not biased because\nthey are fairly accurate measures and predictors. There are, however, real biases, prejudices,\nand inequalities in the social world that might benefit some advantaged group while hindering\nsome disadvantaged others.\nConclusion Intelligence 265\nAlthough you might not be able to spell \u201cesquamulose\u201d or \u201cstaphylococci\u201d \u2013 indeed, you might\nnot even know what they mean\u2014you don\u2019t need to count yourself out in the intelligence\ndepartment. Now that we have examined intelligence in depth we can return to our intuitive\nview of those students who compete in the National Spelling Bee. Are they smart? Certainly,\nthey seem to have high verbal intelligence. There is also the possibility that they benefit from\neither a genetic boost in intelligence, a supportive social environment, or both. Watching them\nspell difficult words there is also much we do not know about them. We cannot tell, for instance,\nhow emotionally intelligent they are or how they might use bodily-kinesthetic intelligence.\nThis highlights the fact that intelligence is a complicated issue. Fortunately, psychologists\ncontinue to research this fascinating topic and their studies continue to yield new insights. Intelligence 266\nVocabulary\nG\nShort for \u201cgeneral factor\u201d and is often used to be synonymous with intelligence itself.\nIntelligence\nAn individual\u2019s cognitive capability. This includes the ability to acquire, process, recall and\napply information.\nIQ\nShort for \u201cintelligence quotient.\u201d This is a score, typically obtained from a widely used measure\nof intelligence that is meant to rank a person\u2019s intellectual ability against that of others.\nNorm\nAssessments are given to a representative sample of a population to determine the range of\nscores for that population. These \u201cnorms\u201d are then used to place an individual who takes that\nassessment on a range of scores in which he or she is compared to the population at large.\nStandardize\nAssessments that are given in the exact same manner to all people . With regards to intelligence\ntests standardized scores are individual scores that are computed to be referenced against\nnormative scores for a population (see \u201cnorm\u201d).\nStereotype threat\nThe phenomenon in which people are concerned that they will conform to a stereotype or\nthat their performance does conform to that stereotype, especially in instances in which the\nstereotype is brought to their conscious awareness.

Bazerman\nHumans are not perfect decision makers. Not only are we not perfect, but we depart from\nperfection or rationality in systematic and predictable ways. The understanding of these\nsystematic and predictable departures is core to the field of judgment and decision making.\nBy understanding these limitations, we can also identify strategies for making better and more\neffective decisions.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Understand the systematic biases that affect our judgment and decision making.\n\u2022 Develop strategies for making better decisions.\n\u2022 Experience some of the biases through sample decisions.\nIntroduction\nEvery day you have the opportunity to make countless decisions: should you eat dessert,\ncheat on a test, or attend a sports event with your friends. If you reflect on your own history\nof choices you will realize that they vary in quality; some are rational and some are not. This\nmodule provides an overview of decision making and includes discussion of many of the\ncommon biases involved in this process.\nIn his Nobel Prize\u2013winning work, psychologist Herbert Simon (1957; March & Simon, 1958)\nargued that our decisions are bounded in their rationality. According to the bounded Judgment and Decision Making 270\nrationality framework, human beings try to make rational decisions (such as weighing the\ncosts and benefits of a choice) but our cognitive limitations prevent us from being fully rational.\nTime and cost constraints limit the quantity and quality of the information that is available to\nus. Moreover, we only retain a relatively small amount of information in our usable memory.\nAnd limitations on intelligence and perceptions constrain the ability of even very bright\ndecision makers to accurately make the best choice based on the information that is available.\nAbout 15 years after the publication of Simon\u2019s\nseminal work, Tversky and Kahneman (1973,\n1974; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) produced\ntheir own Nobel Prize\u2013winning research, which\nprovided critical information about specific\nsystematic and predictable biases, or mistakes,\nthat influence judgment (Kahneman received\nthe prize after Tversky\u2019s death). The work of People are subject to systematic and predictable biases\nSimon, Tversky, and Kahneman paved the way that influence judgment. In many instances this results\nto our modern understanding of judgment and in poor decision-making. [Photo: koocbor]\ndecision making. And their two Nobel prizes\nsignaled the broad acceptance of the field of behavioral decision research as a mature area\nof intellectual study.\nWhat Would a Rational Decision Look Like?\nImagine that during your senior year in college, you apply to a number of doctoral programs,\nlaw schools, or business schools (or another set of programs in whatever field most interests\nyou). The good news is that you receive many acceptance letters. So, how should you decide\nwhere to go? Bazerman and Moore (2013) outline the following six steps that you should take\nto make a rational decision: (1) define the problem (i.e., selecting the right graduate program),\n(2) identify the criteria necessary to judge the multiple options (location, prestige, faculty, etc.),\n(3) weight the criteria (rank them in terms of importance to you), (4) generate alternatives (the\nschools that admitted you), (5) rate each alternative on each criterion (rate each school on\neach criteria that you identified, and (6) compute the optimal decision. Acting rationally would\nrequire that you follow these six steps in a fully rational manner.\nI strongly advise people to think through important decisions such as this in a manner similar\nto this process. Unfortunately, we often don\u2019t. Many of us rely on our intuitions far more than\nwe should. And when we do try to think systematically, the way we enter data into such formal\ndecision-making processes is often biased. Judgment and Decision Making 271\nFortunately, psychologists have learned a\ngreat deal about the biases that affect our\nthinking. This knowledge about the systematic\nand predictable mistakes that even the best\nand the brightest make can help you identify\nflaws in your thought processes and reach\nbetter decisions.\nBiases in Our Decision Process\nSimon\u2019s concept of bounded rationality\ntaught us that judgment deviates from\nrationality, but it did not tell us how judgment\nis biased. Tversky and Kahneman\u2019s (1974)\nPeople often have to use incomplete information to make\nresearch helped to diagnose the specific\ndecisions about risk [Photo: beanhead4529]\nsystematic, directional biases that affect\nhuman judgment. These biases are created\nby the tendency to short-circuit a rational decision process by relying on a number of\nsimplifying strategies, or rules of thumb, known as heuristics. Heuristics allow us to cope with\nthe complex environment surrounding our decisions. Unfortunately, they also lead to\nsystematic and predictable biases.\nTo highlight some of these biases please answer the following three quiz items:\nProblem 1 (adapted from Alpert & Raiffa, 1969):\nListed below are 10 uncertain quantities. Do not look up any information on these items. For\neach, write down your best estimate of the quantity. Next, put a lower and upper bound\naround your estimate, such that you are 98 percent confident that your range surrounds the\nactual quantity. Respond to each of these items even if you admit to knowing very little about\nthese quantities.\n1. The first year the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded\n2. The date the French celebrate \"Bastille Day\"\n3. The distance from the Earth to the Moon\n4. The height of the Leaning Tower of Pisa Judgment and Decision Making 272\n5.

Number of colleges and universities in the Boston metropolitan area\nProblem 2 (adapted from Joyce & Biddle, 1981):\nWe know that executive fraud occurs and that it has been associated with many recent financial\nscandals. And, we know that many cases of management fraud go undetected even when\nannual audits are performed. Do you think that the incidence of significant executive-level\nmanagement fraud is more than 10 in 1,000 firms (that is, 1 percent) audited by Big Four\naccounting firms?\n1. Yes, more than 10 in 1,000 Big Four clients have significant executive-level management\nfraud.\n2. No, fewer than 10 in 1,000 Big Four clients have significant executive-level management\nfraud.\nWhat is your estimate of the number of Big Four clients per 1,000 that have significant\nexecutive-level management fraud? (Fill in the blank below with the appropriate number.)\n________ in 1,000 Big Four clients have significant executive-level management fraud.\nProblem 3 (adapted from Tversky & Kahneman, 1981):\nImagine that the United States is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual avian disease that\nis expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been\nproposed. Assume that the exact scientific estimates of the consequences of the programs\nare as follows.\n1. Program A: If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved.\n2. Program B: If Program B is adopted, there is a one-third probability that 600 people will be\nsaved and a two-thirds probability that no people will be saved. Judgment and Decision Making 273\nWhich of the two programs would you favor?\nOverconfidence\nOn the first problem, if you set your ranges so that you were justifiably 98 percent confident,\nyou should expect that approximately 9.8, or nine to 10, of your ranges would include the\nactual value. So, let\u2019s look at the correct answers:\n1. 1901\n2. 14th of July\n3. 384,403 km (238,857 mi)\n4. 56.67 m (183 ft)\n5. 22,384 (as of 2014)\n6. 536 people (as of 2013)\n7. $6.007 billion\n8. 70.3 years (as of 2012)\n9. 4,321\nOverconfidence is a natural part of most people's decision-making\n10. 52\nprocess and this can get us into trouble. Is it possible to overcome our\nfaulty thinking? Perhaps. See the \"Fixing Our Decisions\" section below.\nCount the number of your 98% ranges\n[Photo: Kimli]\nthat actually surrounded the true\nquantities. If you surrounded nine to 10, you were appropriately confident in your judgments.\nBut most readers surround only between three (30%) and seven (70%) of the correct answers,\ndespite claiming 98% confidence that each range would surround the true value. As this\nproblem shows, humans tend to be overconfident in their judgments.\nAnchoring\nRegarding the second problem, people vary a great deal in their final assessment of the level\nof executive-level management fraud, but most think that 10 out of 1,000 is too low. When I\nrun this exercise in class, half of the students respond to the question that I asked you to\nanswer. The other half receive a similar problem, but instead are asked whether the correct\nanswer is higher or lower than 200 rather than 10. Most people think that 200 is high. But,\nagain, most people claim that this \u201canchor\u201d does not affect their final estimate. Yet, on average,\npeople who are presented with the question that focuses on the number 10 (out of 1,000) Judgment and Decision Making 274\ngive answers that are about one-half the size of the estimates of those facing questions that\nuse an anchor of 200. When we are making decisions, any initial anchor that we face is likely\nto influence our judgments, even if the anchor is arbitrary. That is, we insufficiently adjust our\njudgments away from the anchor.\nFraming\nTurning to Problem 3, most people choose Program A, which saves 200 lives for sure, over\nProgram B. But, again, if I was in front of a classroom, only half of my students would receive\nthis problem. The other half would have received the same set-up, but with the following two\noptions:\n1. Program C: If Program C is adopted, 400 people will die.\n2. Program D: If Program D is adopted, there is a one-third probability that no one will die\nand a two-thirds probability that 600 people will die.\nWhich of the two programs would you favor?\nCareful review of the two versions of this problem clarifies that they are objectively the same.\nSaving 200 people (Program A) means losing 400 people (Program C), and Programs B and D\nare also objectively identical. Yet, in one of the most famous problems in judgment and\ndecision making, most individuals choose Program A in the first set and Program D in the\nsecond set (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). People respond very differently to saving versus\nlosing lives\u2014even when the difference is based just on the \u201cframing\u201d of the choices.\nThe problem that I asked you to respond to was framed in terms of saving lives, and the\nimplied reference point was the worst outcome of 600 deaths. Most of us, when we make\ndecisions that concern gains, are risk averse; as a consequence, we lock in the possibility of\nsaving 200 lives for sure. In the alternative version, the problem is framed in terms of losses.\nNow the implicit reference point is the best outcome of no deaths due to the Asian disease.\nAnd in this case, most people are risk seeking when making decisions regarding losses.\nThese are just three of the many biases that affect even the smartest among us. Other research\nshows that we are biased in favor of information that is easy for our minds to retrieve, are\ninsensitive to the importance of base rates and sample sizes when we are making inferences,\nassume that random events will always look random, search for information that confirms\nour expectations even when disconfirming information would be more informative, claim a\npriori knowledge that didn\u2019t exist due to the hindsight bias, and are subject to a host of other Judgment and Decision Making 275\neffects that continue to be developed in the literature (Bazerman & Moore, 2013).\nContemporary Developments\nBounded rationality served as the integrating concept\nof the field of behavioral decision research for 40\nyears. Then, in 2000, Thaler (2000) suggested that\ndecision making is bounded in two ways not precisely\ncaptured by the concept of bounded rationality. First,\nhe argued that our willpower is bounded and that, as\na consequence, we give greater weight to present\nconcerns than to future concerns. Our immediate\nmotivations are often inconsistent with our long-term\ninterests in a variety of ways, such as the common\nfailure to save adequately for retirement or the\ndifficulty many people have staying on a diet. Second,\nThaler suggested that our self-interest is bounded\nsuch that we care about the outcomes of others.\nSometimes we positively value the outcomes of\nothers\u2014giving them more of a commodity than is\nnecessary out of a desire to be fair, for example. And,\nin unfortunate contexts, we sometimes are willing to\nThe concept of bounded willpower may explain\nwhy many of us are better shoppers than savers. forgo our own benefits out of a desire to harm others.\n[Photo: Tinou Bao]\nMy colleagues and I have recently added two other\nimportant bounds to the list. Chugh, Banaji, and Bazerman (2005) and Banaji and Bhaskar\n(2000) introduced the concept of bounded ethicality, which refers to the notion that our ethics\nare limited in ways we are not even aware of ourselves. Second, Chugh and Bazerman (2007)\ndeveloped the concept of bounded awareness to refer to the broad array of focusing failures\nthat affect our judgment, specifically the many ways in which we fail to notice obvious and\nimportant information that is available to us.\nA final development is the application of judgment and decision-making research to the areas\nof behavioral economics, behavioral finance, and behavioral marketing, among others. In\neach case, these fields have been transformed by applying and extending research from the\njudgment and decision-making literature.\nFixing Our Decisions Judgment and Decision Making 276\nAmple evidence documents that even smart people are routinely impaired by biases. Early\nresearch demonstrated, unfortunately, that awareness of these problems does little to reduce\nbias (Fischhoff, 1982). The good news is that more recent research documents interventions\nthat do help us overcome our faulty thinking (Bazerman & Moore, 2013).\nOne critical path to fixing our biases is provided in Stanovich and West\u2019s (2000) distinction\nbetween System 1 and System 2 decision making. System 1 processing is our intuitive system,\nwhich is typically fast, automatic, effortless, implicit, and emotional. System 2 refers to decision\nmaking that is slower, conscious, effortful, explicit, and logical. The six logical steps of decision\nmaking outlined earlier describe a System 2 process.\nClearly, a complete System 2 process is not required for every decision we make. In most\nsituations, our System 1 thinking is quite sufficient; it would be impractical, for example, to\nlogically reason through every choice we make while shopping for groceries. But, preferably,\nSystem 2 logic should influence our most important decisions. Nonetheless, we use our\nSystem 1 processes for most decisions in life, relying on it even when making important\ndecisions.\nThe key to reducing the effects of bias and improving our decisions is to transition from trusting\nour intuitive System 1 thinking toward engaging more in deliberative System 2 thought.\nUnfortunately, the busier and more rushed people are, the more they have on their minds,\nand the more likely they are to rely on System 1 thinking (Chugh, 2004). The frantic pace of\nprofessional life suggests that executives often rely on System 1 thinking (Chugh, 2004).\nFortunately, it is possible to identify conditions where we rely on intuition at our peril and\nsubstitute more deliberative thought. One fascinating example of this substitution comes\nfrom journalist Michael Lewis\u2019 (2003) account of how Billy Beane, the general manager of the\nOakland Athletics, improved the outcomes of the failing baseball team after recognizing that\nthe intuition of baseball executives was limited and systematically biased and that their\nintuitions had been incorporated into important decisions in ways that created enormous\nmistakes. Lewis (2003) documents that baseball professionals tend to overgeneralize from\ntheir personal experiences, be overly influenced by players\u2019 very recent performances, and\noverweigh what they see with their own eyes, despite the fact that players\u2019 multiyear records\nprovide far better data. By substituting valid predictors of future performance (System 2\nthinking), the Athletics were able to outperform expectations given their very limited payroll.\nAnother important direction for improving decisions comes from Thaler and Sunstein\u2019s (2008)\nbook Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness. Rather than setting out\nto debias human judgment, Thaler and Sunstein outline a strategy for how \u201cdecision architects\u201d Judgment and Decision Making 277\ncan change environments in ways that account for\nhuman bias and trigger better decisions as a result. For\nexample, Beshears, Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2008)\nhave shown that simple changes to defaults can\ndramatically improve people\u2019s decisions. They tackle the\nfailure of many people to save for retirement and show\nthat a simple change can significantly influence\nenrollment in 401(k) programs. In most companies, when\nyou start your job, you need to proactively sign up to join\nthe company\u2019s retirement savings plan. Many people\ntake years before getting around to doing so. When,\ninstead, companies automatically enroll their employees\nin 401(k) programs and give them the opportunity to \u201copt\nout,\u201d the net enrollment rate rises significantly. By\nchanging defaults, we can counteract the human\nNudges can be used to help people make tendency to live with the status quo.\nbetter decisions about saving for retirement.\n[Photo: aag photos]\nSimilarly, Johnson and Goldstein\u2019s (2003) cross-European\norgan donation study reveals that countries that have opt-in organ donation policies, where\nthe default is not to harvest people\u2019s organs without their prior consent, sacrifice thousands\nof lives in comparison to opt-out policies, where the default is to harvest organs. The United\nStates and too many other countries require that citizens opt in to organ donation through a\nproactive effort; as a consequence, consent rates range between 4.25%\u201344% across these\ncountries. In contrast, changing the decision architecture to an opt-out policy improves\nconsent rates to 85.9% to 99.98%. Designing the donation system with knowledge of the power\nof defaults can dramatically change donation rates without changing the options available to\ncitizens. In contrast, a more intuitive strategy, such as the one in place in the United States,\ninspires defaults that result in many unnecessary deaths.\nConcluding Thoughts\nOur days are filled with decisions ranging from the small (what should I wear today?) to the\nimportant (should we get married?). Many have real world consequences on our health,\nfinances and relationships. Simon, Kahneman, and Tversky created a field that highlights the\nsurprising and predictable deficiencies of the human mind when making decisions. As we\nunderstand more about our own biases and thinking shortcomings we can begin to take them\ninto account or to avoid them. Only now have we reached the frontier of using this knowledge\nto help people make better decisions. Judgment and Decision Making 278\nOutside Resources\nBook: Bazerman, M. H., & Moore, D. (2013).

Judging\nfrom their clothing, they are young businessmen, taking a break from work. They then have\nthis exchange.\nAdam: \u201cYou know, Gary bought a ring.\u201d\nBen: \"Oh yeah? For Mary, isn't it?\" (Adam nods.) Language and Language Use 284\nIf you are watching this scene and hearing their conversation, what can you guess from this?\nFirst of all, you\u2019d guess that Gary bought a ring for Mary, whoever Gary and Mary might be.\nPerhaps you would infer that Gary is getting married to Mary. What else can you guess?\nPerhaps that Adam and Ben are fairly close colleagues, and both of them know Gary and Mary\nreasonably well. In other words, you can guess the social relationships surrounding the people\nwho are engaging in the conversation and the people whom they are talking about.\nLanguage is used in our everyday lives. If\npsychology is a science of behavior, scientific\ninvestigation of language use must be one of\nthe most central topics\u2014this is because\nlanguage use is ubiquitous. Every human\ngroup has a language; human infants (except\nthose who have unfortunate disabilities) learn\nat least one language without being taught\nexplicitly. Even when children who don\u2019t have\nmuch language to begin with are brought\nLanguage is an essential tool that enables us to live the kind\ntogether, they can begin to develop and use\nof lives we do. Much of contemporary human civilization\ntheir own language. There is at least one\nwouldn\u2019t have been possible without it. [Photo: Marc\nknown instance where children who had had\nWathieu]\nlittle language were brought together and\ndeveloped their own language spontaneously with minimum input from adults. In Nicaragua\nin the 1980s, deaf children who were separately raised in various locations were brought\ntogether to schools for the first time. Teachers tried to teach them Spanish with little success.\nHowever, they began to notice that the children were using their hands and gestures,\napparently to communicate with each other. Linguists were brought in to find out what was\nhappening\u2014it turned out the children had developed their own sign language by themselves.\nThat was the birth of a new language, Nicaraguan Sign Language (Kegl, Senghas, & Coppola,\n1999). Language is ubiquitous, and we humans are born to use it.\nHow Do We Use Language?\nIf language is so ubiquitous, how do we actually use it? To be sure, some of us use it to write\ndiaries and poetry, but the primary form of language use is interpersonal. That\u2019s how we learn\nlanguage, and that\u2019s how we use it. Just like Adam and Ben, we exchange words and utterances\nto communicate with each other. Let\u2019s consider the simplest case of two people, Adam and\nBen, talking with each other. According to Clark (1996), in order for them to carry out a\nconversation, they must keep track of common ground. Common ground is a set of knowledge Language and Language Use 285\nthat the speaker and listener share and they think, assume, or otherwise take for granted that\nthey share. So, when Adam says, \u201cGary bought a ring,\u201d he takes for granted that Ben knows\nthe meaning of the words he is using, whom Gary is, and what buying a ring means. When\nBen says, \u201cFor Mary, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he takes for granted that Adam knows the meaning of these\nwords, who Mary is, and what buying a ring for someone means. All these are part of their\ncommon ground.\nNote that, when Adam presents the\ninformation about Gary\u2019s purchase of a ring,\nBen responds by presenting his inference\nabout who the recipient of the ring might be,\nnamely, Mary. In conversational terms, Ben\u2019s\nutterance acts as evidence for his\ncomprehension of Adam\u2019s utterance\u2014\u201cYes, I\nunderstood that Gary bought a ring\u201d\u2014and\nAdam\u2019s nod acts as evidence that he now has\nunderstood what Ben has said too\u2014\u201cYes, I\nunderstood that you understood that Gary\nThe \"common ground\" in a conversation helps people\ncoordinate their language use. And as conversations progress has bought a ring for Mary.\u201d This new\ncommon ground shifts and changes as the participants add information is now added to the initial\nnew information and cooperate to help one another\ncommon ground. Thus, the pair of\nunderstand. [Photo: boellstiftung]\nutterances by Adam and Ben (called an\nadjacency pair) together with Adam\u2019s\naffirmative nod jointly completes one proposition, \u201cGary bought a ring for Mary,\u201d and adds\nthis information to their common ground. This way, common ground changes as we talk,\ngathering new information that we agree on and have evidence that we share. It evolves as\npeople take turns to assume the roles of speaker and listener, and actively engage in the\nexchange of meaning.\nCommon ground helps people coordinate their language use. For instance, when a speaker\nsays something to a listener, he or she takes into account their common ground, that is, what\nthe speaker thinks the listener knows. Adam said what he did because he knew Ben would\nknow who Gary was. He\u2019d have said, \u201cA friend of mine is getting married,\u201d to another colleague\nwho wouldn\u2019t know Gary. This is called audience design (Fussell & Krauss, 1992); speakers\ndesign their utterances for their audiences by taking into account the audiences\u2019 knowledge.\nIf their audiences are seen to be knowledgeable about an object (such as Ben about Gary),\nthey tend to use a brief label of the object (i.e., Gary); for a less knowledgeable audience, they\nuse more descriptive words (e.g., \u201ca friend of mine\u201d) to help the audience understand their\nutterances (Box 1). Language and Language Use 286\nSo, language use is a cooperative\nactivity, but how do we coordinate\nour language use in a conversational\nsetting? To be sure, we have a\nconversation in small groups. The\nnumber of people engaging in a\nconversation at a time is rarely more\nthan four. By some counts (e.g.,\nDunbar, Duncan, & Nettle, 1995;\nJames, 1953), more than 90 percent\nof conversations happen in a group\nof four individuals or less. Certainly,\ncoordinating conversation among\nfour is not as difficult as coordinating\nconversation among 10. But, even\namong only four people, if you think\nabout it, everyday conversation is an\nalmost miraculous achievement. We\ntypically have a conversation by\nrapidly exchanging words and\nutterances in real time in a noisy environment. Think about your conversation at home in the\nmorning, at a bus stop, in a shopping mall. How can we keep track of our common ground\nunder such circumstances?\nPickering and Garrod (2004) argue that we achieve our conversational coordination by virtue\nof our ability to interactively align each other\u2019s actions at different levels of language use:\nlexicon (i.e., words and expressions), syntax (i.e., grammatical rules for arranging words and\nexpressions together), as well as speech rate and accent. For instance, when one person uses\na certain expression to refer to an object in a conversation, others tend to use the same\nexpression (e.g., Clark & Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986). Furthermore, if someone says \u201cthe cowboy\noffered a banana to the robber,\u201d rather than \u201cthe cowboy offered the robber a banana,\u201d others\nare more likely to use the same syntactic structure (e.g., \u201cthe girl gave a book to the boy\u201d rather\nthan \u201cthe girl gave the boy a book\u201d) even if different words are involved (Branigan, Pickering,\n& Cleland, 2000). Finally, people in conversation tend to exhibit similar accents and rates of\nspeech, and they are often associated with people\u2019s social identity (Giles, Coupland, &\nCoupland, 1991). So, if you have lived in different places where people have somewhat\ndifferent accents (e.g., United States and United Kingdom), you might have noticed that you\nspeak with Americans with an American accent, but speak with Britons with a British accent. Language and Language Use 287\nPickering and Garrod (2004) suggest that these interpersonal alignments at different levels\nof language use can activate similar situation models in the minds of those who are engaged\nin a conversation. Situation models are representations about the topic of a conversation. So,\nif you are talking about Gary and Mary with your friends, you might have a situation model\nof Gary giving Mary a ring in your mind. Pickering and Garrod\u2019s theory is that as you describe\nthis situation using language, others in the conversation begin to use similar words and\ngrammar, and many other aspects of language use converge. As you all do so, similar situation\nmodels begin to be built in everyone\u2019s mind through the mechanism known as priming.\nPriming occurs when your thinking about one concept (e.g., \u201cring\u201d) reminds you about other\nrelated concepts (e.g., \u201cmarriage\u201d, \u201cwedding ceremony\u201d). So, if everyone in the conversation\nknows about Gary, Mary, and the usual course of events associated with a ring\u2014engagement,\nwedding, marriage, etc.\u2014 everyone is likely to construct a shared situation model about Gary\nand Mary. Thus, making use of our highly developed interpersonal ability to imitate (i.e.,\nexecuting the same action as another person) and cognitive ability to infer (i.e., one idea\nleading to other ideas), we humans coordinate our common ground, share situation models,\nand communicate with each other.\nWhat Do We Talk About?\nWhat are humans doing when we are talking?\nSurely, we can communicate about mundane\nthings such as what to have for dinner, but\nalso more complex and abstract things such\nas the meaning of life and death, liberty,\nequality, and fraternity, and many other\nphilosophical thoughts. Well, when naturally\noccurring conversations were actually\nobserved (Dunbar, Marriott, & Duncan,\n1997), a staggering 60%\u201370% of everyday\nconversation, for both men and women,\nturned out to be gossip\u2014people talk about\nthemselves and others whom they know. Just\nlike Adam and Ben, more often than not,\nStudies show that people love to gossip. By gossiping, humans\npeople use language to communicate about\ncan communicate and share their representations about their\ntheir social world.\nsocial world\u2014who their friends and enemies are, what the\nright thing to do is under what circumstances, and so on.\nGossip may sound trivial and seem to belittle\n[Photo: Bindaas Madhav]\nour noble ability for language\u2014surely one of Language and Language Use 288\nthe most remarkable human abilities of all that distinguish us from other animals. Au contraire,\nsome have argued that gossip\u2014activities to think and communicate about our social world\n\u2014is one of the most critical uses to which language has been put. Dunbar (1996) conjectured\nthat gossiping is the human equivalent of grooming, monkeys and primates attending and\ntending to each other by cleaning each other\u2019s fur. He argues that it is an act of socializing,\nsignaling the importance of one\u2019s partner. Furthermore, by gossiping, humans can\ncommunicate and share their representations about their social world\u2014who their friends\nand enemies are, what the right thing to do is under what circumstances, and so on. In so\ndoing, they can regulate their social world\u2014making more friends and enlarging one\u2019s own\ngroup (often called the ingroup, the group to which one belongs) against other groups\n(outgroups) that are more likely to be one\u2019s enemies. Dunbar has argued that it is these social\neffects that have given humans an evolutionary advantage and larger brains, which, in turn,\nhelp humans to think more complex and abstract thoughts and, more important, maintain\nlarger ingroups. Dunbar (1993) estimated an equation that predicts average group size of\nnonhuman primate genera from their average neocortex size (the part of the brain that\nsupports higher order cognition). In line with his social brain hypothesis, Dunbar showed\nthat those primate genera that have larger brains tend to live in larger groups. Furthermore,\nusing the same equation, he was able to estimate the group size that human brains can\nsupport, which turned out to be about 150\u2014approximately the size of modern hunter-\ngatherer communities. Dunbar\u2019s argument is that language, brain, and human group living\nhave co-evolved\u2014language and human sociality are inseparable.\nDunbar\u2019s hypothesis is controversial. Nonetheless, whether or not he is right, our everyday\nlanguage use often ends up maintaining the existing structure of intergroup relationships.\nLanguage use can have implications for how we construe our social world. For one thing,\nthere are subtle cues that people use to convey the extent to which someone\u2019s action is just\na special case in a particular context or a pattern that occurs across many contexts and more\nlike a character trait of the person. According to Semin and Fiedler (1988), someone\u2019s action\ncan be described by an action verb that describes a concrete action (e.g., he runs), a state\nverb that describes the actor\u2019s psychological state (e.g., he likes running), an adjective that\ndescribes the actor\u2019s personality (e.g., he is athletic), or a noun that describes the actor\u2019s role\n(e.g., he is an athlete). Depending on whether a verb or an adjective (or noun) is used, speakers\ncan convey the permanency and stability of an actor\u2019s tendency to act in a certain way\u2014verbs\nconvey particularity, whereas adjectives convey permanency. Intriguingly, people tend to\ndescribe positive actions of their ingroup members using adjectives (e.g., he is generous)\nrather than verbs (e.g., he gave a blind man some change), and negative actions of outgroup\nmembers using adjectives (e.g., he is cruel) rather than verbs (e.g., he kicked a dog). Maass,\nSalvi, Arcuri, and Semin (1989) called this a linguistic intergroup bias, which can produce and\nreproduce the representation of intergroup relationships by painting a picture favoring the Language and Language Use 289\ningroup. That is, ingroup members are typically good, and if they do anything bad, that\u2019s more\nan exception in special circumstances; in contrast, outgroup members are typically bad, and\nif they do anything good, that\u2019s more an exception.\nIn addition, when people exchange\ntheir gossip, it can spread through\nbroader social networks. If gossip is\ntransmitted from one person to\nanother, the second person can\ntransmit it to a third person, who then\nin turn transmits it to a fourth, and so\non through a chain of communication.\nThis often happens for emotive stories\n(Box 2). If gossip is repeatedly\ntransmitted and spread, it can reach a\nlarge number of people. When stories\ntravel through communication chains,\nthey tend to become conventionalized\n(Bartlett, 1932). A Native American tale\nof the \u201cWar of the Ghosts\u201d recounts a\nwarrior\u2019s encounter with ghosts\ntraveling in canoes and his involvement\nwith their ghostly battle. He is shot by\nan arrow but doesn\u2019t die, returning\nhome to tell the tale. After his narration, however, he becomes still, a black thing comes out\nof his mouth, and he eventually dies. When it was told to a student in England in the 1920s\nand retold from memory to another person, who, in turn, retold it to another and so on in a\ncommunication chain, the mythic tale became a story of a young warrior going to a battlefield,\nin which canoes became boats, and the black thing that came out of his mouth became simply\nhis spirit (Bartlett, 1932). In other words, information transmitted multiple times was\ntransformed to something that was easily understood by many, that is, information was\nassimilated into the common ground shared by most people in the linguistic community. More\nrecently, Kashima (2000) conducted a similar experiment using a story that contained\nsequence of events that described a young couple\u2019s interaction that included both\nstereotypical and counter-stereotypical actions (e.g., a man watching sports on TV on Sunday\nvs. a man vacuuming the house). After the retelling of this story, much of the counter-\nstereotypical information was dropped, and stereotypical information was more likely to be\nretained. Because stereotypes are part of the common ground shared by the community, this\nfinding too suggests that conversational retellings are likely to reproduce conventional Language and Language Use 290\ncontent.\nPsychological Consequences of Language Use\nWhat are the psychological consequences of language use? When people use language to\ndescribe an experience, their thoughts and feelings are profoundly shaped by the linguistic\nrepresentation that they have produced rather than the original experience per se (Holtgraves\n& Kashima, 2008). For example, Halberstadt (2003) showed a picture of a person displaying\nan ambiguous emotion and examined how people evaluated the displayed emotion. When\npeople verbally explained why the target person was expressing a particular emotion, they\ntended to remember the person as feeling that emotion more intensely than when they simply\nlabeled the emotion.\nThus, constructing a linguistic representation of\nanother person\u2019s emotion apparently biased the\nspeaker\u2019s memory of that person\u2019s emotion.\nFurthermore, linguistically labeling one\u2019s own\nemotional experience appears to alter the speaker\u2019s\nneural processes. When people linguistically\nlabeled negative images, the amygdala\u2014a brain\nstructure that is critically involved in the processing\nof negative emotions such as fear\u2014was activated\nless than when they were not given a chance to label\nthem (Lieberman et al., 2007). Potentially because\nof these effects of verbalizing emotional\nexperiences, linguistic reconstructions of negative\nlife events can have some therapeutic effects on\nthose who suffer from the traumatic experiences\n(Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999). Lyubomirsky, Sousa,\nand Dickerhoof (2006) found that writing and\ntalking about negative past life events improved\npeople\u2019s psychological well-being, but just thinking By verbalizing our own emotional experiences - such\nabout them worsened it. There are many other as in a conversation with a close friend - we can\nexamples of effects of language use on memory and improve our psychological well-being.\ndecision making (Holtgraves & Kashima, 2008).\nFurthermore, if a certain type of language use (linguistic practice) (Holtgraves & Kashima,\n2008) is repeated by a large number of people in a community, it can potentially have a Language and Language Use 291\nsignificant effect on their thoughts and\naction. This notion is often called Sapir-\nWhorf hypothesis (Sapir, 1921; Whorf,\n1956; Box 3). For instance, if you are\ngiven a description of a man, Steven, as\nhaving greater than average experience\nof the world (e.g., well-traveled, varied\njob experience), a strong family\norientation, and well-developed social\nskills, how do you describe Steven? Do\nyou think you can remember Steven\u2019s\npersonality five days later? It will\nprobably be difficult. But if you know\nChinese and are reading about Steven\nin Chinese, as Hoffman, Lau, and\nJohnson (1986) showed, the chances\nare that you can remember him well.\nThis is because English does not have a\nword to describe this kind of\npersonality, whereas Chinese does (sh\u00ec\ng\u00f9). This way, language you use can\ninfluence your cognition. In its strong\nform, it has been argued that language\ndetermines thought, but this is probably\nwrong. Language does not completely\ndetermine our thoughts\u2014our thoughts\nare far too flexible for that\u2014but\nhabitual uses of language can influence\nour habit of thought and action. For\ninstance, some linguistic practice\nseems to be associated even with\ncultural values and social institution.\nPronoun drop is the case in point.\nPronouns such as \u201cI\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d are used\nto represent the speaker and listener of\na speech in English. In an English\nsentence, these pronouns cannot be\ndropped if they are used as the subject of a sentence. So, for instance, \u201cI went to the movie\nlast night\u201d is fine, but \u201cWent to the movie last night\u201d is not in standard English. However, in Language and Language Use 292\nother languages such as Japanese, pronouns can be, and in fact often are, dropped from\nsentences. It turned out that people living in those countries where pronoun drop languages\nare spoken tend to have more collectivistic values (e.g., employees having greater loyalty\ntoward their employers) than those who use non\u2013pronoun drop languages such as English\n(Kashima & Kashima, 1998). It was argued that the explicit reference to \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cI\u201d may\nremind speakers the distinction between the self and other, and the differentiation between\nindividuals. Such a linguistic practice may act as a constant reminder of the cultural value,\nwhich, in turn, may encourage people to perform the linguistic practice.\nConclusion\nLanguage and language use constitute a central ingredient of human psychology. Language\nis an essential tool that enables us to live the kind of life we do. Can you imagine a world in\nwhich machines are built, farms are cultivated, and goods and services are transported to our\nhousehold without language? Is it possible for us to make laws and regulations, negotiate\ncontracts, and enforce agreements and settle disputes without talking? Much of contemporary\nhuman civilization wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the human ability to develop and use\nlanguage. Like the Tower of Babel, language can divide humanity, and yet, the core of humanity\nincludes the innate ability for language use. Whether we can use it wisely is a task before us\nin this globalized world. Language and Language Use 293\nDiscussion Questions\n1. In what sense is language use innate and learned?\n2.

Chris Fraley\nThe purpose of this module is to provide a brief review of attachment theory\u2014a theory\ndesigned to explain the significance of the close, emotional bonds that children develop with\ntheir caregivers and the implications of those bonds for understanding personality\ndevelopment. The module discusses the origins of the theory, research on individual\ndifferences in attachment security in infancy and childhood, and the role of attachment in\nadult relationships.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Explain the way the attachment system works and its evolutionary significance.\n\u2022 Identify three commonly studied attachment patterns and what is known about the\ndevelopment of those patterns.\n\u2022 Describe what is known about the consequences of secure versus insecure attachment in\nadult relationships.\nIntroduction\nSome of the most rewarding experiences in people\u2019s lives involve the development and\nmaintenance of close relationships. For example, some of the greatest sources of joy involve\nfalling in love, starting a family, being reunited with distant loved ones, and sharing experiences\nwith close others. And, not surprisingly, some of the most painful experiences in people\u2019s lives\ninvolve the disruption of important social bonds, such as separation from a spouse, losing a Attachment Through the Life Course 300\nparent, or being abandoned by a loved one.\nWhy do close relationships play such a\nprofound role in human experience?\nAttachment theory is one approach to\nunderstanding the nature of close relationships.\nIn this module, we review the origins of the\ntheory, the core theoretical principles, and\nsome ways in which attachment influences\nhuman behavior, thoughts, and feelings\nacross the life course.\nAttachment Theory: A Brief\nHistory and Core Concepts\nAttachment theory was originally developed\nin the 1940s by John Bowlby, a British\nRelationships are the fabric of society, and are integral to the psychoanalyst who was attempting to\nmaintenance of our species. [Image: Percy Sledge Agbunag understand the intense distress experienced\nCarballo] by infants who had been separated from their\nparents. Bowlby (1969) observed that infants\nwould go to extraordinary lengths to prevent separation from their parents or to reestablish\nproximity to a missing parent. For example, he noted that children who had been separated\nfrom their parents would often cry, call for their parents, refuse to eat or play, and stand at\nthe door in desperate anticipation of their parents\u2019 return. At the time of Bowlby\u2019s initial\nwritings, psychoanalytic writers held that these expressions were manifestations of immature\ndefense mechanisms that were operating to repress emotional pain. However, Bowlby\nobserved that such expressions are common to a wide variety of mammalian species and\nspeculated that these responses to separation may serve an evolutionary function (see Box 1).\nDrawing on evolutionary theory, Bowlby (1969) argued that these behaviors are adaptive\nresponses to separation from a primary attachment figure\u2014a caregiver who provides\nsupport, protection, and care. Because human infants, like other mammalian infants, cannot\nfeed or protect themselves, they are dependent upon the care and protection of \u201colder and\nwiser\u201d adults for survival. Bowlby argued that, over the course of evolutionary history, infants\nwho were able to maintain proximity to an attachment figure would be more likely to survive\nto a reproductive age. Attachment Through the Life Course 301\nAccording to Bowlby, a motivational system, what he called the attachment behavioral\nsystem, was gradually \u201cdesigned\u201d by natural selection to regulate proximity to an attachment\nfigure. The attachment system functions much like a thermostat that continuously monitors\nthe ambient temperature of a room, comparing that temperature against a desired state and\nadjusting behavior (e.g., activating the furnace) accordingly. In the case of the attachment\nsystem, Bowlby argued that the system continuously monitors the accessibility of the primary\nattachment figure. If the child perceives the attachment figure to be nearby, accessible, and\nattentive, then the child feels loved, secure, and confident and, behaviorally, is likely to explore\nhis or her environment, play with others, and be sociable. If, however, the child perceives the\nattachment figure to be inaccessible, the child experiences anxiety and, behaviorally, is likely\nto exhibit attachment behaviors ranging from simple visual searching on the low extreme to\nactive searching, following, and vocal signaling on the other. These attachment behaviors Attachment Through the Life Course 302\ncontinue either until the child is able\nto reestablish a desirable level of\nphysical or psychological proximity\nto the attachment figure or until the\nchild exhausts himself or herself or\ngives up, as may happen in the\ncontext of a prolonged separation or\nloss.\nIndividual Differences in\nInfant Attachment\nThink of your earliest memory, does it involve just you, or does it include\nyour loved ones, your family and caretakers? [Image: Harsha K R]\nAlthough Bowlby believed that\nthese basic dynamics captured the way the attachment system works in most children, he\nrecognized that there are individual differences in the way children appraise the accessibility\nof the attachment figure and how they regulate their attachment behavior in response to\nthreats. However, it was not until his colleague, Mary Ainsworth, began to systematically study\ninfant\u2013parent separations that a formal understanding of these individual differences\nemerged. Ainsworth and her students developed a technique called the strange situation\u2014\na laboratory task for studying infant\u2013parent attachment (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall,\n1978). In the strange situation, 12-month-old infants and their parents are brought to the\nlaboratory and, over a period of approximately 20 minutes, are systematically separated from\nand reunited with one another. In the strange situation, most children (about 60%) behave in\nthe way implied by Bowlby\u2019s normative theory. Specifically, they become upset when the\nparent leaves the room, but, when he or she returns, they actively seek the parent and are\neasily comforted by him or her. Children who exhibit this pattern of behavior are often called\nsecure. Other children (about 20% or less) are ill at ease initially and, upon separation, become\nextremely distressed. Importantly, when reunited with their parents, these children have a\ndifficult time being soothed and often exhibit conflicting behaviors that suggest they want to\nbe comforted, but that they also want to \u201cpunish\u201d the parent for leaving. These children are\noften called anxious-resistant. The third pattern of attachment that Ainsworth and her\ncolleagues documented is often labeled avoidant. Avoidant children (about 20%) do not\nconsistently behave as if they are stressed by the separation but, upon reunion, actively avoid\nseeking contact with their parent, sometimes turning their attention to play objects on the\nlaboratory floor.\nAinsworth\u2019s work was important for at least three reasons. First, she provided one of the first\nempirical demonstrations of how attachment behavior is organized in unfamiliar contexts. Attachment Through the Life Course 303\nSecond, she provided the first empirical taxonomy of individual differences in infant\nattachment patterns. According to her research, at least three types of children exist: those\nwho are secure in their relationship with their parents, those who are anxious-resistant, and\nthose who are anxious-avoidant. Finally, she demonstrated that these individual differences\nwere correlated with infant\u2013parent interactions in the home during the first year of life.\nChildren who appear secure in the strange situation, for example, tend to have parents who\nare responsive to their needs. Children who appear insecure in the strange situation (i.e.,\nanxious-resistant or avoidant) often have parents who are insensitive to their needs, or\ninconsistent or rejecting in the care they provide.\nAntecedents of Attachment Patterns\nIn the years that have followed\nAinsworth\u2019s ground-breaking re\u00ad\nsearch, researchers have investigated\na variety of factors that may help\ndetermine whether children\ndevelop secure or insecure\nrelationships with their primary\nattachment figures. As mentioned\nabove, one of the key determinants\nof attachment patterns is the\nhistory of sensitive and responsive\ninteractions between the caregiver\nand the child. In short, when the\nIs attachment style multi-generational? How does one person\u2019s childhood\nchild is uncertain or stressed, the attachment style translate to the way they interact with their own children?\nability of the caregiver to provide [Image: Kamau Akabueze]\nsupport to the child is critical for\nhis or her psychological development. It is assumed that such supportive interactions help\nthe child learn to regulate his or her emotions, give the child the confidence to explore the\nenvironment, and provide the child with a safe haven during stressful circumstances.\nEvidence for the role of sensitive caregiving in shaping attachment patterns comes from\nlongitudinal and experimental studies. For example, Grossmann, Grossmann, Spangler,\nSuess, and Unzner (1985) studied parent\u2013child interactions in the homes of 54 families, up to\nthree times during the first year of the child\u2019s life. At 12 months of age, infants and their\nmothers participated in the strange situation. Grossmann and her colleagues found that\nchildren who were classified as secure in the strange situation at 12 months of age were more Attachment Through the Life Course 304\nlikely than children classified as insecure to have mothers who provided responsive care to\ntheir children in the home environment.\nVan den Boom (1994) developed an intervention that was designed to enhance maternal\nsensitive responsiveness. When the infants were 9 months of age, the mothers in the\nintervention group were rated as more responsive and attentive in their interaction with their\ninfants compared to mothers in the control group. In addition, their infants were rated as\nmore sociable, self-soothing, and more likely to explore the environment. At 12 months of\nage, children in the intervention group were more likely to be classified as secure than insecure\nin the strange situation.\nAttachment Patterns and Child Outcomes\nAttachment researchers have studied the association between children\u2019s attachment patterns\nand their adaptation over time. Researchers have learned, for example, that children who are\nclassified as secure in the strange situation are more likely to have high functioning\nrelationships with peers, to be evaluated favorably by teachers, and to persist with more\ndiligence in challenging tasks. In contrast, insecure-avoidant children are more likely to be\nconstrued as \u201cbullies\u201d or to have a difficult time building and maintaining friendships\n(Weinfield, Sroufe, Egeland, & Carlson, 2008).\nAttachment in Adulthood\nAlthough Bowlby was primarily focused on understanding the nature of the infant\u2013caregiver\nrelationship, he believed that attachment characterized human experience across the life\ncourse. It was not until the mid-1980s, however, that researchers began to take seriously the\npossibility that attachment processes may be relevant to adulthood. Hazan and Shaver (1987)\nwere two of the first researchers to explore Bowlby\u2019s ideas in the context of romantic\nrelationships. According to Hazan and Shaver, the emotional bond that develops between\nadult romantic partners is partly a function of the same motivational system\u2014the attachment\nbehavioral system\u2014that gives rise to the emotional bond between infants and their\ncaregivers. Hazan and Shaver noted that in both kinds of relationship, people (a) feel safe and\nsecure when the other person is present; (b) turn to the other person during times of sickness,\ndistress, or fear; (c) use the other person as a \u201csecure base\u201d from which to explore the world;\nand (d) speak to one another in a unique language, often called \u201cmotherese\u201d or \u201cbaby talk.\u201d\n(See Box 2)\nOn the basis of these parallels, Hazan and Shaver (1987) argued that adult romantic Attachment Through the Life Course 305\nrelationships, such as infant\u2013caregiver relationships, are attachments. According to Hazan\nand Shaver, individuals gradually transfer attachment-related functions from parents to peers\nas they develop. Thus, although young children tend to use their parents as their primary\nattachment figures, as they reach adolescence and young adulthood, they come to rely more\nupon close friends and/or romantic partners for basic attachment-related functions. Thus,\nalthough a young child may turn to his or her mother for comfort, support, and guidance\nwhen distressed, scared, or ill, young adults may be more likely to turn to their romantic\npartners for these purposes under similar situations.\nHazan and Shaver (1987) asked a diverse sample of adults to read the three paragraphs below\nand indicate which paragraph best characterized the way they think, feel, and behave in close\nrelationships:\n1. I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to trust them\ncompletely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I am nervous when anyone gets\ntoo close, and often, others want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being. Attachment Through the Life Course 306\n2. I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable depending on them and\nhaving them depend on me. I don\u2019t worry about being abandoned or about someone\ngetting too close to me.\n3. I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner\ndoesn\u2019t really love me or won\u2019t want to stay with me. I want to get very close to my partner,\nand this sometimes scares people away.\nConceptually, these descriptions were designed to represent what Hazan and Shaver\nconsidered to be adult analogues of the kinds of attachment patterns Ainsworth described\nin the strange situation (avoidant, secure, and anxious, respectively). Hazan and Shaver (1987)\nfound that the distribution of the three patterns was similar to that observed in infancy. In\nother words, about 60% of adults classified themselves as secure (paragraph B), about 20%\ndescribed themselves as avoidant (paragraph A), and about 20% described themselves as\nanxious-resistant (paragraph C). Moreover, they found that people who described themselves\nas secure, for example, were more likely to report having had warm and trusting relationships\nwith their parents when they were growing up. In addition, they were more likely to have\npositive views of romantic relationships. Based on these findings, Hazan and Shaver (1987)\nconcluded that the same kinds of individual differences that exist in infant attachment also\nexist in adulthood.\nResearch on Attachment in Adulthood\nAttachment theory has inspired a large amount of literature in social, personality, and clinical\npsychology. In the sections below, I provide a brief overview of some of the major research\nquestions and what researchers have learned about attachment in adulthood.\nWho Ends Up with Whom?\nWhen people are asked what kinds of psychological or behavioral qualities they are seeking\nin a romantic partner, a large majority of people indicate that they are seeking someone who\nis kind, caring, trustworthy, and understanding\u2014the kinds of attributes that characterize a\n\u201csecure\u201d caregiver (Chappell & Davis, 1998). But we know that people do not always end up\nwith others who meet their ideals. Are secure people more likely to end up with secure partners\n\u2014and, vice versa, are insecure people more likely to end up with insecure partners? The\nmajority of the research that has been conducted to date suggests that the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d\nFrazier, Byer, Fischer, Wright, and DeBord (1996), for example, studied the attachment\npatterns of more than 83 heterosexual couples and found that, if the man was relatively Attachment Through the Life Course 307\nsecure, the woman was also likely to be secure.\nOne important question is whether these findings\nexist because (a) secure people are more likely to\nbe attracted to other secure people, (b) secure\npeople are likely to create security in their partners\nover time, or (c) some combination of these\npossibilities. Existing empirical research strongly\nsupports the first alternative. For example, when\npeople have the opportunity to interact with\nindividuals who vary in security in a speed-dating\ncontext, they express a greater interest in those\nwho are higher in security than those who are\nmore insecure (McClure, Lydon, Baccus, & Baldwin,\n2010). However, there is also some evidence that\npeople\u2019s attachment styles mutually shape one\nanother in close relationships. For example, in a\nlongitudinal study, Hudson, Fraley, Vicary, and\nPeople who had relatively secure attachments as Brumbaugh (2012) found that, if one person in a\nchildren go on to have more secure romantic relationship experienced a change in security, his\nattachments. [Image: Nicolas Fuentes] or her partner was likely to experience a change in\nthe same direction.\nRelationship Functioning\nResearch has consistently demonstrated that individuals who are relatively secure are more\nlikely than insecure individuals to have high functioning relationships\u2014relationships that are\nmore satisfying, more enduring, and less characterized by conflict. For example, Feeney and\nNoller (1992) found that insecure individuals were more likely than secure individuals to\nexperience a breakup of their relationship. In addition, secure individuals are more likely to\nreport satisfying relationships (e.g., Collins & Read, 1990) and are more likely to provide\nsupport to their partners when their partners were feeling distressed (Simpson, Rholes, &\nNelligan, 1992).\nDo Early Experiences Shape Adult Attachment?\nThe majority of research on this issue is retrospective\u2014that is, it relies on adults\u2019 reports of\nwhat they recall about their childhood experiences. This kind of work suggests that secure Attachment Through the Life Course 308\nadults are more likely to\ndescribe their early childhood\nexperiences with their\nparents as being supportive,\nloving, and kind (Hazan &\nShaver, 1987). A number\nof longitudinal studies are\nemerging that demonstrate\nprospective associations\nbetween early attachment\nexperiences and adult\nattachment styles and/or\nSharing food, celebrations and traditions are some of the ways we establish secure interpersonal functioning\nattachments with our loved ones from an early age. [Image: skeeze] in adulthood. For example,\nFraley, Roisman, Booth-\nLaForce, Owen, and Holland (2013) found in a sample of more than 700 individuals studied\nfrom infancy to adulthood that maternal sensitivity across development prospectively\npredicted security at age 18. Simpson, Collins, Tran, and Haydon (2007) found that attachment\nsecurity, assessed in infancy in the strange situation, predicted peer competence in grades 1\nto 3, which, in turn, predicted the quality of friendship relationships at age 16, which, in turn,\npredicted the expression of positive and negative emotions in their adult romantic\nrelationships at ages 20 to 23.\nIt is easy to come away from such findings with the mistaken assumption that early experiences\n\u201cdetermine\u201d later outcomes. To be clear: Attachment theorists assume that the relationship\nbetween early experiences and subsequent outcomes is probabilistic, not deterministic.\nHaving supportive and responsive experiences with caregivers early in life is assumed to set\nthe stage for positive social development. But that does not mean that attachment patterns\nare set in stone. In short, even if an individual has far from optimal experiences in early life,\nattachment theory suggests that it is possible for that individual to develop well-functioning\nadult relationships through a number of corrective experiences\u2014including relationships with\nsiblings, other family members, teachers, and close friends. Security is best viewed as a\nculmination of a person\u2019s attachment history rather than a reflection of his or her early\nexperiences alone. Those early experiences are considered important not because they\ndetermine a person\u2019s fate, but because they provide the foundation for subsequent\nexperiences.

You\nknow you that although you cannot see your car keys they\u2019ve got to be around here someplace.\nWhat\u2019s more, you know that if you want to communicate complex ideas like ordering a triple-\nshot soy vanilla latte with chocolate sprinkles it\u2019s better to use words with meanings attached\nto them rather than simply gesturing and grunting. People accumulate all this useful Cognitive Development in Childhood 315\nknowledge through the process of cognitive development, which involves a multitude of\nfactors, both inherent and learned.\nCognitive development refers to the development\nof thinking across the lifespan. Defining thinking\ncan be problematic, because no clear boundaries\nseparate thinking from other mental activities.\nThinking obviously involves the higher mental\nprocesses: problem solving, reasoning, creating,\nconceptualizing, categorizing, remembering, planning,\nand so on. However, thinking also involves other\nmental processes that seem more basic and at\nwhich even toddlers are skilled\u2014such as\nperceiving objects and events in the environment,\nacting skillfully on objects to obtain goals, and\nunderstanding and producing language. Yet other\nareas of human development that involve thinking\nare not usually associated with cognitive\ndevelopment, because thinking isn\u2019t a prominent\nfeature of them\u2014such as personality and\ntemperament. Cognitive development in childhood is about change.\nFrom birth to adolescence a young person's mind\nchanges dramatically in many important ways.\nAs the name suggests, cognitive development is\n[Photo: Kayusa]\nabout change. Children\u2019s thinking changes in\ndramatic and surprising ways. Consider DeVries\u2019s (1969) study of whether young children\nunderstand the difference between appearance and reality. To find out, she brought an\nunusually even-tempered cat named Maynard to a psychology laboratory and allowed the 3-\nto 6-year-old participants in the study to pet and play with him. DeVries then put a mask of a\nfierce dog on Maynard\u2019s head, and asked the children what Maynard was. Despite all of the\nchildren having identified Maynard previously as a cat, now most 3-year-olds said that he was\na dog and claimed that he had a dog\u2019s bones and a dog\u2019s stomach. In contrast, the 6-year-olds\nweren\u2019t fooled; they had no doubt that Maynard remained a cat. Understanding how children\u2019s\nthinking changes so dramatically in just a few years is one of the fascinating challenges in\nstudying cognitive development.\nThere are several main types of theories of child development. Stage theories, such as Piaget\u2019s\nstage theory, focus on whether children progress through qualitatively different stages of\ndevelopment. Sociocultural theories, such as that of Lev Vygotsky, emphasize how other\npeople and the attitudes, values, and beliefs of the surrounding culture, influence children\u2019s Cognitive Development in Childhood 316\ndevelopment. Information processing theories, such as that of David Klahr, examine the\nmental processes that produce thinking at any one time and the transition processes that\nlead to growth in that thinking.\nAt the heart of all of these theories, and indeed of all research on cognitive development, are\ntwo main questions: (1) How do nature and nurture interact to produce cognitive\ndevelopment? (2) Does cognitive development progress through qualitatively distinct stages?\nIn the remainder of this module, we examine the answers that are emerging regarding these\nquestions, as well as ways in which cognitive developmental research is being used to improve\neducation.\nNature and Nurture\nThe most basic question about child development is how nature and nurture together shape\ndevelopment. Nature refers to our biological endowment, the genes we receive from our\nparents. Nurture refers to the environments, social as well as physical, that influence our\ndevelopment, everything from the womb in which we develop before birth to the homes in\nwhich we grow up, the schools we attend, and the many people with whom we interact.\nThe nature-nurture issue is often presented as an either-or question: Is our intelligence (for\nexample) due to our genes or to the environments in which we live? In fact, however, every\naspect of development is produced by the interaction of genes and environment. At the most\nbasic level, without genes, there would be no child, and without an environment to provide\nnurture, there also would be no child.\nThe way in which nature and nurture work together can be seen in findings on visual\ndevelopment. Many people view vision as something that people either are born with or that\nis purely a matter of biological maturation, but it also depends on the right kind of experience\nat the right time. For example, development of depth perception, the ability to actively\nperceive the distance from oneself of objects in the environment, depends on seeing patterned\nlight and having normal brain activity in response to the patterned light, in infancy (Held,\n1993). If no patterned light is received, for example when a baby has severe cataracts or\nblindness that is not surgically corrected until later in development, depth perception remains\nabnormal even after the surgery.\nAdding to the complexity of the nature-nurture interaction, children\u2019s genes lead to their\neliciting different treatment from other people, which influences their cognitive development.\nFor example, infants\u2019 physical attractiveness and temperament are influenced considerably Cognitive Development in Childhood 317\nby their genetic inheritance, but it is also the\ncase that parents provide more sensitive\nand affectionate care to easygoing and\nattractive infants than to difficult and less\nattractive ones, which can contribute to the\ninfants\u2019 later cognitive development (Langlois\net al., 1995; van den Boom & Hoeksma,\n1994).\nAlso contributing to the complex interplay\nA child that is perceived to be attractive and calm may receive\nof nature and nurture is the role of children a different sort of care and attention from adults and as a result\nin shaping their own cognitive development. enjoy a developmental advantage. [Photo: tarotastic]\nFrom the first days out of the womb, children\nactively choose to attend more to some things and less to others. For example, even 1-month-\nolds choose to look at their mother\u2019s face more than at the faces of other women of the same\nage and general level of attractiveness (Bartrip, Morton, & de Schonen, 2001). Children\u2019s\ncontributions to their own cognitive development grow larger as they grow older (Scarr &\nMcCartney, 1983). When children are young, their parents largely determine their experiences:\nwhether they will attend day care, the children with whom they will have play dates, the books\nto which they have access, and so on. In contrast, older children and adolescents choose their\nenvironments to a larger degree. Their parents\u2019 preferences largely determine how 5-year-\nolds spend time, but 15-year-olds\u2019 own preferences largely determine when, if ever, they set\nfoot in a library. Children\u2019s choices often have large consequences. To cite one example, the\nmore that children choose to read, the more that their reading improves in future years (Baker,\nDreher, & Guthrie, 2000). Thus, the issue is not whether cognitive development is a product\nof nature or nurture; rather, the issue is how nature and nurture work together to produce\ncognitive development.\nDoes Cognitive Development Progress Through Distinct Stages?\nSome aspects of the development of living organisms, such as the growth of the width of a\npine tree, involve quantitative changes, with the tree getting a little wider each year. Other\nchanges, such as the life cycle of a ladybug, involve qualitative changes, with the creature\nbecoming a totally different type of entity after a transition than before (Figure 1). The existence\nof both gradual, quantitative changes and relatively sudden, qualitative changes in the world\nhas led researchers who study cognitive development to ask whether changes in children\u2019s\nthinking are gradual and continuous or sudden and discontinuous. Cognitive Development in Childhood 318\nFigure 1: Continuous and discontinuous development. Some researchers see development as a\ncontinuous gradual process, much like a maple tree growing steadily in height and cross-sectional area.\nOther researchers see development as a progression of discontinuous stages, involving rapid\ndiscontinuous changes, such as those in the life cycle of a ladybug, separated by longer periods of slow,\ngradual change.\nThe great Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget proposed that children\u2019s thinking progresses through\na series of four discrete stages. By \u201cstages,\u201d he meant periods during which children reasoned\nsimilarly about many superficially different problems, with the stages occurring in a fixed\norder and the thinking within different stages differing in fundamental ways. The four stages\nthat Piaget hypothesized were the sensorimotor stage (birth to 2 years), the preoperational\nreasoning stage (2 to 6 or 7 years), the concrete operational reasoning stage (6 or 7 to 11\nor 12 years), and the formal operational reasoning stage (11 or 12 years and throughout the\nrest of life).\nDuring the sensorimotor stage, children\u2019s thinking is largely realized through their perceptions\nof the world and their physical interactions with it. Their mental representations are very\nlimited. Consider Piaget\u2019s object permanence task, which is one of his most famous problems.\nIf an infant younger than 9 months of age is playing with a favorite toy, and another person\nremoves the toy from view, for example by putting it under an opaque cover and not letting\nthe infant immediately reach for it, the infant is very likely to make no effort to retrieve it and\nto show no emotional distress (Piaget, 1954). This is not due to their being uninterested in\nthe toy or unable to reach for it; if the same toy is put under a clear cover, infants below 9\nmonths readily retrieve it (Munakata, McClelland, Johnson, & Siegler, 1997). Instead, Piaget\nclaimed that infants less than 9 months do not understand that objects continue to exist even\nwhen out of sight.\nDuring the preoperational stage, according to Piaget, children can solve not only this simple Cognitive Development in Childhood 319\nproblem (which they actually can solve after 9 months) but show a wide variety of other\nsymbolic-representation capabilities, such as those involved in drawing and using language.\nHowever, such 2- to 7-year-olds tend to focus on a single dimension, even when solving\nproblems would require them to consider multiple dimensions. This is evident in Piaget\u2019s\n(1952) conservation problems. For example, if a glass of water is poured into a taller, thinner\nglass, children below age 7 generally say that there now is more water than before. Similarly,\nif a clay ball is reshaped into a long, thin sausage, they claim that there is now more clay, and\nif a row of coins is spread out, they claim that there are now more coins. In all cases, the\nchildren are focusing on one dimension, while ignoring the changes in other dimensions (for\nexample, the greater width of the glass and the clay ball).\nPiaget's Sensorimotor and Pre-operational Reasoning stages\nChildren overcome this tendency to focus on a single dimension during the concrete\noperations stage, and think logically in most situations. However, according to Piaget, they\nstill cannot think in systematic scientific ways, even when such thinking would be useful. Thus,\nif asked to find out which variables influence the period that a pendulum takes to complete\nits arc, and given weights that they can attach to strings in order to do experiments with the\npendulum to find out, most children younger than age 12, perform biased experiments from\nwhich no conclusion can be drawn, and then conclude that whatever they originally believed Cognitive Development in Childhood 320\nis correct. For example, if a boy believed that weight was the only variable that mattered, he\nmight put the heaviest weight on the shortest string and push it the hardest, and then conclude\nthat just as he thought, weight is the only variable that matters (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958).\nFinally, in the formal operations period, children attain the reasoning power of mature adults,\nwhich allows them to solve the pendulum problem and a wide range of other problems.\nHowever, this formal operations stage tends not to occur without exposure to formal\neducation in scientific reasoning, and appears to be largely or completely absent from some\nsocieties that do not provide this type of education.\nAlthough Piaget\u2019s theory has been very influential, it has not gone unchallenged. Many more\nrecent researchers have obtained findings indicating that cognitive development is\nconsiderably more continuous than Piaget claimed. For example, Diamond (1985) found that\non the object permanence task described above, infants show earlier knowledge if the waiting\nperiod is shorter. At age 6 months, they retrieve the hidden object if the wait is no longer than\n2 seconds; at 7 months, they retrieve it if the wait is no longer than 4 seconds; and so on. Even\nearlier, at 3 or 4 months, infants show surprise in the form of longer looking times if objects\nsuddenly appear to vanish with no obvious cause (Baillargeon, 1987). Similarly, children\u2019s\nspecific experiences can greatly influence when developmental changes occur. Children of\npottery makers in Mexican villages, for example, know that reshaping clay does not change\nPiaget's Concrete and Formal Operations stages Cognitive Development in Childhood 321\nthe amount of clay at much younger ages than children who do not have similar experiences\n(Price-Williams, Gordon, & Ramirez, 1969).\nSo, is cognitive development fundamentally continuous or fundamentally discontinuous? A\nreasonable answer seems to be, \u201cIt depends on how you look at it and how often you look.\u201d\nFor example, under relatively facilitative circumstances, infants show early forms of object\npermanence by 3 or 4 months, and they gradually extend the range of times for which they\ncan remember hidden objects as they grow older. However, on Piaget\u2019s original object\npermanence task, infants do quite quickly change toward the end of their first year from not\nreaching for hidden toys to reaching for them, even after they\u2019ve experienced a substantial\ndelay before being allowed to reach. Thus, the debate between those who emphasize\ndiscontinuous, stage-like changes in cognitive development and those who emphasize gradual\ncontinuous changes remains a lively one.\nApplications to Education\nUnderstanding how children think and learn has proven useful for improving education. One\nexample comes from the area of reading. Cognitive developmental research has shown that\nphonemic awareness\u2014that is, awareness of the component sounds within words\u2014is a\ncrucial skill in learning to read. To measure awareness of the component sounds within words,\nresearchers ask children to decide whether two words rhyme, to decide whether the words\nstart with the same sound, to identify the component sounds within words, and to indicate\nwhat would be left if a given sound were removed from a word. Kindergartners\u2019 performance\non these tasks is the strongest\npredictor of reading achievement\nin third and fourth grade, even\nstronger than IQ or social class\nbackground (Nation, 2008). Moreover,\nteaching these skills to randomly\nchosen 4- and 5-year-olds results in\ntheir being better readers years\nlater (National Reading Panel,\n2000).\nAnother educational application of\ncognitive developmental research\nActivities like playing games that involve working with numbers and spatial\nrelationships can give young children a developmental advantage over involves the area of mathematics.\npeers who have less exposure to the same concepts. [Photo: Ben Husmann] Even before they enter kindergarten, Cognitive Development in Childhood 322\nthe mathematical knowledge of children from low-income backgrounds lags far behind that\nof children from more affluent backgrounds. Ramani and Siegler (2008) hypothesized that\nthis difference is due to the children in middle- and upper-income families engaging more\nfrequently in numerical activities, for example playing numerical board games such as Chutes\nand Ladders. Chutes and Ladders is a game with a number in each square; children start at\nthe number one and spin a spinner or throw a dice to determine how far to move their token.\nPlaying this game seemed likely to teach children about numbers, because in it, larger numbers\nare associated with greater values on a variety of dimensions. In particular, the higher the\nnumber that a child\u2019s token reaches, the greater the distance the token will have traveled from\nthe starting point, the greater the number of physical movements the child will have made in\nmoving the token from one square to another, the greater the number of number words the\nchild will have said and heard, and the more time will have passed since the beginning of the\ngame. These spatial, kinesthetic, verbal, and time-based cues provide a broad-based,\nmultisensory foundation for knowledge of numerical magnitudes (the sizes of numbers), a\ntype of knowledge that is closely related to mathematics achievement test scores (Booth &\nSiegler, 2006).\nPlaying this numerical board game for roughly 1 hour, distributed over a 2-week period,\nimproved low-income children\u2019s knowledge of numerical magnitudes, ability to read printed\nnumbers, and skill at learning novel arithmetic problems. The gains lasted for months after\nthe game-playing experience (Ramani & Siegler, 2008; Siegler & Ramani, 2009). An advantage\nof this type of educational intervention is that it has minimal if any cost\u2014a parent could just\ndraw a game on a piece of paper.\nUnderstanding of cognitive development is advancing on many different fronts. One exciting\narea is linking changes in brain activity to changes in children\u2019s thinking (Nelson et al., 2006).\nAlthough many people believe that brain maturation is something that occurs before birth,\nthe brain actually continues to change in large ways for many years thereafter. For example,\na part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, which is located at the front of the brain and\nis particularly involved with planning and flexible problem solving, continues to develop\nthroughout adolescence (Blakemore & Choudhury, 2006). Such new research domains, as\nwell as enduring issues such as nature and nurture, continuity and discontinuity, and how to\napply cognitive development research to education, insure that cognitive development will\ncontinue to be an exciting area in the coming years.\nConclusion\nResearch into cognitive development has shown us that minds don\u2019t just form according to a Cognitive Development in Childhood 323\nuniform blueprint or innate intellect, but through a combination of influencing factors. For\ninstance, if we want our kids to have a strong grasp of language we could concentrate on\nphonemic awareness early on. If we want them to be good at math and science we could\nengage them in numerical games and activities early on. Perhaps most importantly, we no\nlonger think of brains as empty vessels waiting to be filled up with knowledge but as adaptable\norgans that develop all the way through early adulthood.

Physical changes associated with puberty are triggered by\nhormones. Cognitive changes include improvements in complex and abstract thought, as well\nas development that happens at different rates in distinct parts of the brain and increases\nadolescents\u2019 propensity for risky behavior because increases in sensation-seeking and reward\nmotivation precede increases in cognitive control. Adolescents\u2019 relationships with parents go\nthrough a period of redefinition in which adolescents become more autonomous, and aspects\nof parenting, such as distal monitoring and psychological control, become more salient. Peer\nrelationships are important sources of support and companionship during adolescence yet\ncan also promote problem behaviors. Same-sex peer groups evolve into mixed-sex peer\ngroups, and adolescents\u2019 romantic relationships tend to emerge from these groups. Identity\nformation occurs as adolescents explore and commit to different roles and ideological\npositions. Nationality, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religious background, sexual\norientation, and genetic factors shape how adolescents behave and how others respond to\nthem, and are sources of diversity in adolescence.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Describe major features of physical, cognitive, and social development during adolescence.\n\u2022 Understand why adolescence is a period of heightened risk taking.\n\u2022 Be able to explain sources of diversity in adolescent development.\nAdolescence Defined Adolescent Development 330\nAdolescence is a developmental stage that has been defined as starting with puberty and\nending with the transition to adulthood (approximately ages 10\u201320). Adolescence has evolved\nhistorically, with evidence indicating that this stage is lengthening as individuals start puberty\nearlier and transition to adulthood later than in the past. Puberty today begins, on average,\nat age 10\u201311 years for girls and 11\u201312 years for boys. This average age of onset has decreased\ngradually over time since the 19th century by 3\u20134 months per decade, which has been\nattributed to a range of factors including better nutrition, obesity, increased father absence,\nand other environmental factors (Steinberg, 2013). Completion of formal education, financial\nindependence from parents, marriage, and parenthood have all been markers of the end of\nadolescence and beginning of adulthood, and all of these transitions happen, on average,\nlater now than in the past. In fact, the prolonging of adolescence has prompted the\nintroduction of a new developmental period called emerging adulthood that captures these\ndevelopmental changes out of adolescence and into adulthood, occurring from approximately\nages 18 to 29 (Arnett, 2000).\nThis module will outline changes\nthat occur during adolescence in\nthree domains: physical, cognitive,\nand social. Within the social\ndomain, changes in relationships\nwith parents, peers, and romantic\npartners will be considered. Next,\nthe module turns to adolescents\u2019\npsychological and behavioral adj\u00ad\nustment, including identity formation,\naggression and antisocial behavior,\nAdolescence is often characterized as a period of transformation, primarily, anxiety and depression, and\nin terms of physical, cognitive, and social-relational change. [Image: Lorenia] academic achievement. Finally,\nthe module summarizes sources\nof diversity in adolescents\u2019 experiences and development.\nPhysical Changes\nPhysical changes of puberty mark the onset of adolescence (Lerner & Steinberg, 2009). For\nboth boys and girls, these changes include a growth spurt in height, growth of pubic and\nunderarm hair, and skin changes (e.g., pimples). Boys also experience growth in facial hair\nand a deepening of their voice. Girls experience breast development and begin menstruating.\nThese pubertal changes are driven by hormones, particularly an increase in testosterone for Adolescent Development 331\nboys and estrogen for girls.\nCognitive Changes\nMajor changes in the\nstructure and functioning\nof the brain occur during\nadolescence and result in\ncognitive and behavioral\ndevelopments (Steinberg,\n2008). Cognitive changes\nduring adolescence include\na shift from concrete to Although these boys are all of a similar age, you can see how the physical changes (e.\nmore abstract and complex g., height, facial structure) happen differently for everyone. [Image: faungg's photos]\nthinking. Such changes are\nfostered by improvements during early adolescence in attention, memory, processing speed,\nand metacognition (ability to think about thinking and therefore make better use of strategies\nlike mnemonic devices that can improve thinking). Early in adolescence, changes in the brain\u2019s\ndopaminergic system contribute to increases in adolescents\u2019 sensation-seeking and reward\nmotivation. Later in adolescence, the brain\u2019s cognitive control centers in the prefrontal cortex\ndevelop, increasing adolescents\u2019 self-regulation and future orientation. The difference in\ntiming of the development of these different regions of the brain contributes to more risk\ntaking during middle adolescence because adolescents are motivated to seek thrills that\nsometimes come from risky behavior, such as reckless driving, smoking, or drinking, and have\nnot yet developed the cognitive control to resist impulses or focus equally on the potential\nrisks (Steinberg, 2008). One of the world\u2019s leading experts on adolescent development,\nLaurence Steinberg, likens this to engaging a powerful engine before the braking system is in\nplace. The result is that adolescents are more prone to risky behaviors than are children or\nadults.\nSocial Changes\nParents\nAlthough peers take on greater importance during adolescence, family relationships remain\nimportant too. One of the key changes during adolescence involves a renegotiation of parent\u2013\nchild relationships. As adolescents strive for more independence and autonomy during this Adolescent Development 332\ntime, different aspects of\nparenting become more salient.\nFor example, parents\u2019 distal\nsupervision and monitoring\nbecome more important as\nadolescents spend more\ntime away from parents and\nin the presence of peers.\nParental monitoring encom\u00ad\npasses a wide range of\nbehaviors such as parents\u2019\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain that produces feelings of pleasure.\nDuring adolescence, people tend to do whatever activities produce the most attempts to set rules and\ndopamine, without fully considering the consequences of such actions. [Image: know their adolescents\u2019 friends,\nSebastian Bojara] activities, and whereabouts,\nin addition to adolescents\u2019\nwillingness to disclose information to their parents (Stattin & Kerr, 2000). Psychological\ncontrol, which involves manipulation and intrusion into adolescents\u2019 emotional and cognitive\nworld through invalidating adolescents\u2019 feelings and pressuring them to think in particular\nways (Barber, 1996), is another aspect of parenting that becomes more salient during\nadolescence and is related to more problematic adolescent adjustment.\nPeers\nAs children become adolescents, they usually begin spending more time with their peers and\nless time with their families, and these peer interactions are increasingly unsupervised by\nadults. Children\u2019s notions of friendship often focus on shared activities, whereas adolescents\u2019\nnotions of friendship increasingly focus on intimate exchanges of thoughts and feelings.\nDuring adolescence, peer groups evolve from primarily single-sex to mixed-sex. Adolescents\nwithin a peer group tend to be similar to one another in behavior and attitudes, which has\nbeen explained as being a function of homophily (adolescents who are similar to one another\nchoose to spend time together in a \u201cbirds of a feather flock together\u201d way) and influence\n(adolescents who spend time together shape each other\u2019s behavior and attitudes). One of the\nmost widely studied aspects of adolescent peer influence is known as deviant peer contagion\n(Dishion & Tipsord, 2011), which is the process by which peers reinforce problem behavior\nby laughing or showing other signs of approval that then increase the likelihood of future\nproblem behavior.\nPeers can serve both positive and negative functions during adolescence. Negative peer Adolescent Development 333\npressure can lead adolescents to make riskier decisions or engage in more problematic\nbehavior than they would alone or in the presence of their family. For example, adolescents\nare much more likely to drink alcohol, use drugs, and commit crimes when they are with their\nfriends than when they are alone or with their family. However, peers also serve as an\nimportant source of social support and companionship during adolescence, and adolescents\nwith positive peer relationships are happier and better adjusted than those who are socially\nisolated or have conflictual peer relationships.\nCrowds are an emerging level\nof peer relationships in\nadolescence. In contrast to\nfriendships (which are reciprocal\ndyadic relationships) and\ncliques (which refer to groups\nof individuals who interact\nfrequently), crowds are char\u00ad\nacterized more by shared\nreputations or images than\nactual interactions (Brown &\nLarson, 2009). These crowds\nCrowds refer to different collections of people, like the \u201ctheater kids\u201d or the\n\u201cenvironmentalists.\u201d In a way, they are kind of like clothing brands that label the reflect different prototypic\npeople associated with that crowd. [Image: Garry Knight] identities (such as jocks or\nbrains) and are often linked\nwith adolescents\u2019 social status and peers\u2019 perceptions of their values or behaviors.\nRomantic relationships\nAdolescence is the developmental period during which romantic relationships typically first\nemerge. Initially, same-sex peer groups that were common during childhood expand into\nmixed-sex peer groups that are more characteristic of adolescence. Romantic relationships\noften form in the context of these mixed-sex peer groups (Connolly, Furman, & Konarski,\n2000). Although romantic relationships during adolescence are often short-lived rather than\nlong-term committed partnerships, their importance should not be minimized. Adolescents\nspend a great deal of time focused on romantic relationships, and their positive and negative\nemotions are more tied to romantic relationships (or lack thereof) than to friendships, family\nrelationships, or school (Furman & Shaffer, 2003). Romantic relationships contribute to\nadolescents\u2019 identity formation, changes in family and peer relationships, and adolescents\u2019\nemotional and behavioral adjustment. Adolescent Development 334\nFurthermore, romantic relationships are centrally connected to adolescents\u2019 emerging\nsexuality. Parents, policymakers, and researchers have devoted a great deal of attention to\nadolescents\u2019 sexuality, in large part because of concerns related to sexual intercourse,\ncontraception, and preventing teen pregnancies. However, sexuality involves more than this\nnarrow focus. For example, adolescence is often when individuals who are lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, or transgender come to perceive themselves as such (Russell, Clarke, & Clary, 2009).\nThus, romantic relationships are a domain in which adolescents experiment with new\nbehaviors and identities.\nBehavioral and Psychological Adjustment\nIdentity formation\nTheories of adolescent development often focus on identity formation as a central issue. For\nexample, in Erikson\u2019s (1968) classic theory of developmental stages, identity formation was\nhighlighted as the primary indicator of successful development during adolescence (in\ncontrast to role confusion, which would be an indicator of not successfully meeting the task\nof adolescence). Marcia (1966) described identify formation during adolescence as involving\nboth decision points and commitments with respect to ideologies (e.g., religion, politics) and\noccupations. He described four identity statuses: foreclosure, identity diffusion, moratorium,\nand identity achievement. Foreclosure occurs when an individual commits to an identity\nwithout exploring options. Identity diffusion occurs when adolescents neither explore nor\ncommit to any identities. Moratorium is a state in which adolescents are actively exploring\noptions but have not yet made commitments. Identity achievement occurs when individuals\nhave explored different options and then made identity commitments. Building on this work,\nother researchers have investigated more specific aspects of identity. For example, Phinney\n(1989) proposed a model of ethnic identity development that included stages of unexplored\nethnic identity, ethnic identity search, and achieved ethnic identity.\nAggression and antisocial behavior\nSeveral major theories of the development of antisocial behavior treat adolescence as an\nimportant period. Patterson\u2019s (1982) early versus late starter model of the development of\naggressive and antisocial behavior distinguishes youths whose antisocial behavior begins\nduring childhood (early starters) versus adolescence (late starters). According to the theory,\nearly starters are at greater risk for long-term antisocial behavior that extends into adulthood\nthan are late starters. Late starters who become antisocial during adolescence are theorized Adolescent Development 335\nto experience poor parental monitoring\nand supervision, aspects of parenting\nthat become more salient during\nadolescence. Poor monitoring and\nlack of supervision contribute to\nincreasing involvement with deviant\npeers, which in turn promotes\nadolescents\u2019 own antisocial behavior.\nLate starters desist from antisocial\nbehavior when changes in the\nenvironment make other options\nmore appealing. Similarly, Moffitt\u2019s\n(1993) life-course persistent versus\nadolescent-limited model distinguishes\nbetween antisocial behavior that\nbegins in childhood versus adolescence.\nEarly, antisocial behavior leads to befriending others who also engage\nMoffitt regards adolescent-limited\nin antisocial behavior, which only perpetuates the downward cycle of\nantisocial behavior as resulting from a\naggression and wrongful acts. [Image: Philippe Put]\n\u201cmaturity gap\u201d between adolescents\u2019\ndependence on and control by adults and their desire to demonstrate their freedom from\nadult constraint. However, as they continue to develop, and legitimate adult roles and\nprivileges become available to them, there are fewer incentives to engage in antisocial\nbehavior, leading to desistance in these antisocial behaviors.\nAnxiety and depression\nDevelopmental models of anxiety and depression also treat adolescence as an important\nperiod, especially in terms of the emergence of gender differences in prevalence rates that\npersist through adulthood (Rudolph, 2009). Starting in early adolescence, compared with\nmales, females have rates of anxiety that are about twice as high and rates of depression that\nare 1.5 to 3 times as high (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Although the rates vary\nacross specific anxiety and depression diagnoses, rates for some disorders are markedly\nhigher in adolescence than in childhood or adulthood. For example, prevalence rates for\nspecific phobias are about 5% in children and 3%\u20135% in adults but 16% in adolescents. Anxiety\nand depression are particularly concerning because suicide is one of the leading causes of\ndeath during adolescence. Developmental models focus on interpersonal contexts in both\nchildhood and adolescence that foster depression and anxiety (e.g., Rudolph, 2009). Family\nadversity, such as abuse and parental psychopathology, during childhood sets the stage for Adolescent Development 336\nsocial and behavioral problems during adolescence. Adolescents with such problems generate\nstress in their relationships (e.g., by resolving conflict poorly and excessively seeking\nreassurance) and select into more maladaptive social contexts (e.g., \u201cmisery loves company\u201d\nscenarios in which depressed youths select other depressed youths as friends and then\nfrequently co-ruminate as they discuss their problems, exacerbating negative affect and\nstress). These processes are intensified for girls compared with boys because girls have more\nrelationship-oriented goals related to intimacy and social approval, leaving them more\nvulnerable to disruption in these relationships. Anxiety and depression then exacerbate\nproblems in social relationships, which in turn contribute to the stability of anxiety and\ndepression over time.\nAcademic achievement\nAdolescents spend more waking time in school than in any other context (Eccles & Roeser,\n2011). Academic achievement during adolescence\nis predicted by interpersonal (e.g., parental\nengagement in adolescents\u2019 education), intrapersonal\n(e.g., intrinsic motivation), and institutional (e.\ng., school quality) factors. Academic achievement\nis important in its own right as a marker of\npositive adjustment during adolescence but\nalso because academic achievement sets the\nstage for future educational and occupational\nopportunities. The most serious consequence\nof school failure, particularly dropping out of\nschool, is the high risk of unemployment or\nunderemployment in adulthood that follows.\nHigh achievement can set the stage for college\nor future vocational training and opportunities.\nDiversity\nAdolescent development does not necessarily\nfollow the same pathway for all individuals.\nCertain features of adolescence, particularly\nAlthough similar biological changes occur for all\nwith respect to biological changes associated\nadolescents as they enter puberty, these changes can\ndiffer significantly depending on one\u2019s cultural, ethnic, and with puberty and cognitive changes associated\nsocietal factors. [Image: McGeorge BLSA] with brain development, are relatively Adolescent Development 337\nuniversal. But other features of adolescence depend largely on circumstances that are more\nenvironmentally variable. For example, adolescents growing up in one country might have\ndifferent opportunities for risk taking than adolescents in a different country, and supports\nand sanctions for different behaviors in adolescence depend on laws and values that might\nbe specific to where adolescents live. Likewise, different cultural norms regarding family and\npeer relationships shape adolescents\u2019 experiences in these domains. For example, in some\ncountries, adolescents\u2019 parents are expected to retain control over major decisions, whereas\nin other countries, adolescents are expected to begin sharing in or taking control of decision\nmaking.\nEven within the same country, adolescents\u2019 gender, ethnicity, immigrant status, religion, sexual\norientation, socioeconomic status, and personality can shape both how adolescents behave\nand how others respond to them, creating diverse developmental contexts for different\nadolescents. For example, early puberty (that occurs before most other peers have\nexperienced puberty) appears to be associated with worse outcomes for girls than boys, likely\nin part because girls who enter puberty early tend to associate with older boys, which in turn\nis associated with early sexual behavior and substance use. For adolescents who are ethnic\nor sexual minorities, discrimination sometimes presents a set of challenges that nonminorities\ndo not face.\nFinally, genetic variations contribute an additional source of diversity in adolescence. Current\napproaches emphasize gene X environment interactions, which often follow a differential\nsusceptibility model (Belsky & Pluess, 2009). That is, particular genetic variations are\nconsidered riskier than others, but genetic variations also can make adolescents more or less\nsusceptible to environmental factors. For example, the association between the\nCHRM2genotype and adolescent externalizing behavior (aggression and delinquency)has\nbeen found in adolescents whose parents are low in monitoring behaviors (Dick et al., 2011).\nThus, it is important to bear in mind that individual differences play an important role in\nadolescent development.\nConclusions\nAdolescent development is characterized by biological, cognitive, and social changes. Social\nchanges are particularly notable as adolescents become more autonomous from their\nparents, spend more time with peers, and begin exploring romantic relationships and\nsexuality. Adjustment during adolescence is reflected in identity formation, which often\ninvolves a period of exploration followed by commitments to particular identities. Adolescence\nis characterized by risky behavior, which is made more likely by changes in the brain in which Adolescent Development 338\nreward-processing centers develop more rapidly than cognitive control systems, making\nadolescents more sensitive to rewards than to possible negative consequences. Despite these\ngeneralizations, factors such as country of residence, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation\nshape development in ways that lead to diversity of experiences across adolescence.

Thus, trait\npsychology rests on the idea that people differ from one another in terms of where they stand\non a set of basic trait dimensions that persist over time and across situations. The most widely\nused system of traits is called the Five-Factor Model. This system includes five broad traits\nthat can be remembered with the acronym OCEAN: Openness, Conscientiousness,\nExtraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Each of the major traits from the Big Five can\nbe divided into facets to give a more fine-grained analysis of someone's personality. In addition,\nsome trait theorists argue that there are other traits that cannot be completely captured by\nthe Five-Factor Model. Critics of the trait concept argue that people do not act consistently\nfrom one situation to the next and that people are very influenced by situational forces.

Some people are very talkative while others are very quiet.\nSome are active whereas others are couch potatoes. Some worry a lot, others almost never\nseem anxious. Each time we use one of these words, words like \u201ctalkative,\u201d \u201cquiet,\u201d \u201cactive,\u201d\nor \u201canxious,\u201d to describe those around us, we are talking about a person\u2019s personality\u2014the\ncharacteristic ways that people differ from one another. Personality psychologists try to\ndescribe and understand these differences.\nAlthough there are many ways to think about\nthe personalities that people have, Gordon\nAllport and other \u201cpersonologists\u201d claimed\nthat we can best understand the differences\nbetween individuals by understanding their\npersonality traits. Personality traits reflect\nbasic dimensions on which people differ\n(Matthews, Deary, & Whiteman, 2003).\nAccording to trait psychologists, there are a\nlimited number of these dimensions\n(dimensions like Extraversion, Conscientiousness,\nor Agreeableness), and each individual falls\nsomewhere on each dimension, meaning that\nthey could be low, medium, or high on any\nspecific trait.\nAn important feature of personality traits is\nthat they reflect continuous distributions\nrather than distinct personality types. This\nPersonality is made up of traits-- identifiable and relatively\nmeans that when personality psychologists\nstable characteristics-- that set each individual person apart\ntalk about Introverts and Extraverts, they are\nfrom others. [Images: laura dye]\nnot really talking about two distinct types of Personality Traits 346\npeople who are completely and qualitatively different from one another. Instead, they are\ntalking about people who score relatively low or relatively high along a continuous distribution.\nIn fact, when personality psychologists measure traits like Extraversion, they typically find\nthat most people score somewhere in the middle, with smaller numbers showing more\nextreme levels. The figure below shows the distribution of Extraversion scores from a survey\nof thousands of people. As you can see, most people report being moderately, but not\nextremely, extraverted, with fewer people reporting very high or very low scores.\nThere are three criteria that are\ncharacterize personality traits: (1)\nconsistency, (2) stability, and (3)\nindividual differences.\n1. To have a personality trait,\nindividuals must be somewhat\nconsistent across situations in their\nbehaviors related to the trait. For\nexample, if they are talkative at\nhome, they tend also to be talkative\nat work.\n2. Individuals with a trait are also\nsomewhat stable over time in\nbehaviors related to the trait. If they\nare talkative, for example, at age 30,\nFigure 1. Distribution of Extraversion Scores in a Sample Higher bars\nthey will also tend to be talkative at\nmean that more people have scores of that level. This figure shows that\nage 40.\nmost people score towards the middle of the extraversion scale, with\nfewer people who are highly extraverted or highly introverted. 3. People differ from one another on\nbehaviors related to the trait. Using\nspeech is not a personality trait and neither is walking on two feet\u2014virtually all individuals\ndo these activities, and there are almost no individual differences. But people differ on\nhow frequently they talk and how active they are, and thus personality traits such as\nTalkativeness and Activity Level do exist.\nA challenge of the trait approach was to discover the major traits on which all people differ.\nScientists for many decades generated hundreds of new traits, so that it was soon difficult to\nkeep track and make sense of them. For instance, one psychologist might focus on individual\ndifferences in \u201cfriendliness,\u201d whereas another might focus on the highly related concept of\n\u201csociability.\u201d Scientists began seeking ways to reduce the number of traits in some systematic Personality Traits 347\nway and to discover the basic traits that describe most of the differences between people.\nThe way that Gordon Allport and his colleague Henry Odbert approached this was to search\nthe dictionary for all descriptors of personality (Allport & Odbert, 1936). Their approach was\nguided by the lexical hypothesis, which states that all important personality characteristics\nshould be reflected in the language that we use to describe other people. Therefore, if we\nwant to understand the fundamental ways in which people differ from one another, we can\nturn to the words that people use to describe one another. So if we want to know what words\npeople use to describe one another, where should we look? Allport and Odbert looked in the\nmost obvious place\u2014the dictionary. Specifically, they took all the personality descriptors that\nthey could find in the dictionary (they started with almost 18,000 words but quickly reduced\nthat list to a more manageable number) and then used statistical techniques to determine\nwhich words \u201cwent together.\u201d In other words, if everyone who said that they were \u201cfriendly\u201d\nalso said that they were \u201csociable,\u201d then this might mean that personality psychologists would\nonly need a single trait to capture individual differences in these characteristics. Statistical\ntechniques were used to determine whether a small number of dimensions might underlie\nall of the thousands of words we use to describe people.\nThe Five-Factor Model of Personality\nResearch that used the lexical approach showed that many of the personality descriptors\nfound in the dictionary do indeed overlap. In other words, many of the words that we use to\ndescribe people are synonyms. Thus, if we want to know what a person is like, we do not\nnecessarily need to ask how sociable they are, how friendly they are, and how gregarious they\nare. Instead, because sociable people tend to be friendly and gregarious, we can summarize\nthis personality dimension with a single term. Someone who is sociable, friendly, and\ngregarious would typically be described as an \u201cExtravert.\u201d Once we know she is an extravert,\nwe can assume that she is sociable, friendly, and gregarious.\nStatistical methods (specifically, a technique called factor analysis) helped to determine\nwhether a small number of dimensions underlie the diversity of words that people like Allport\nand Odbert identified. The most widely accepted system to emerge from this approach was\n\u201cThe Big Five\u201d or \u201cFive-Factor Model\u201d (Goldberg, 1990; McCrae & John, 1992; McCrae & Costa,\n1987). The Big Five comprises five major traits shown in the Figure 2 below. A way to remember\nthese five is with the acronym OCEAN (O is for Openness; C is for Conscientiousness; E is for\nExtraversion; A is for Agreeableness; N is for Neuroticism). Figure 3 provides descriptions of\npeople who would score high and low on each of these traits. Personality Traits 348\nFigure 2. Descriptions of the Big Five Personality Traits\nScores on the Big Five traits are mostly independent. That means that a person\u2019s standing on\none trait tells very little about their standing on the other traits of the Big Five. For example,\na person can be extremely high in Extraversion and be either high or low on Neuroticism.\nSimilarly, a person can be low in Agreeableness and be either high or low in Conscientiousness.\nThus, in the Five-Factor Model, you need five scores to describe most of an individual\u2019s\npersonality.\nIn the Appendix to this module, we present a short scale to assess the Five-Factor Model of\npersonality (Donnellan, Oswald, Baird, & Lucas, 2006). You can take this test to see where you\nstand in terms of your Big Five scores. John Johnson has also created a helpful website that\nhas personality scales that can be used and taken by the general public:\nhttp://www.personal.psu.edu/j5j/IPIP/ipipneo120.htm\nAfter seeing your scores, you can judge for yourself whether you think such tests are valid.\nTraits are important and interesting because they describe stable patterns of behavior that\npersist for long periods of time (Caspi, Roberts, & Shiner, 2005). Importantly, these stable\npatterns can have broad-ranging consequences for many areas of our life (Roberts, Kuncel,\nShiner, Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007). For instance, think about the factors that determine success\nin college. If you were asked to guess what factors predict good grades in college, you might\nguess something like intelligence. This guess would be correct, but we know much more about\nwho is likely to do well. Specifically, personality researchers have also found the personality\ntraits like Conscientiousness play an important role in college and beyond, probably because\nhighly conscientious individuals study hard, get their work done on time, and are less\ndistracted by nonessential activities that take time away from school work. In addition, highly Personality Traits 349\nFigure 3. Example behaviors for those scoring low and high for the big 5 traits\nconscientious people are often healthier than people low in conscientiousness because they\nare more likely to maintain healthy diets, to exercise, and to follow basic safety procedures\nlike wearing seat belts or bicycle helmets. Over the long term, this consistent pattern of\nbehaviors can add up to meaningful differences in health and longevity. Thus, personality\ntraits are not just a useful way to describe people you know; they actually help psychologists\npredict how good a worker someone will be, how long he or she will live, and the types of jobs\nand activities the person will enjoy. Thus, there is growing interest in personality psychology\namong psychologists who work in applied settings, such as health psychology or\norganizational psychology.\nFacets of Traits (Subtraits)\nSo how does it feel to be told that your entire personality can be summarized with scores on\njust five personality traits? Do you think these five scores capture the complexity of your own\nand others\u2019 characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors? Most people would\nprobably say no, pointing to some exception in their behavior that goes against the general\npattern that others might see. For instance, you may know people who are warm and friendly\nand find it easy to talk with strangers at a party yet are terrified if they have to perform in\nfront of others or speak to large groups of people. The fact that there are different ways of\nbeing extraverted or conscientious shows that there is value in considering lower-level units\nof personality that are more specific than the Big Five traits. These more specific, lower-level Personality Traits 350\nunits of personality are often called facets.\nTo give you a sense of what these narrow\nunits are like, Figure 4 shows facets for each\nof the Big Five traits. It is important to note\nthat although personality researchers\ngenerally agree about the value of the Big\nFive traits as a way to summarize one\u2019s\npersonality, there is no widely accepted list\nof facets that should be studied. The list seen\nhere, based on work by researchers Paul\nCosta and Jeff McCrae, thus reflects just one\npossible list among many. It should,\nhowever, give you an idea of some of the\nfacets making up each of the Five-Factor\nModel.\nFacets can be useful because they provide\nmore specific descriptions of what a person\nis like. For instance, if we take our friend who\nloves parties but hates public speaking, we\nmight say that this person scores high on the\n\u201cgregariousness\u201d and \u201cwarmth\u201d facets of\nextraversion, while scoring lower on facets\nsuch as \u201cassertiveness\u201d or \u201cexcitement-\nseeking.\u201d This precise profile of facet scores\nnot only provides a better description, it\nmight also allow us to better predict how this\nfriend will do in a variety of different jobs (for\nexample, jobs that require public speaking\nversus jobs that involve one-on-one\nFigure 4. Facets of Traits interactions with customers; Paunonen &\nAshton, 2001). Because different facets\nwithin a broad, global trait like extraversion tend to go together (those who are gregarious\nare often but not always assertive), the broad trait often provides a useful summary of what\na person is like. But when we really want to know a person, facet scores add to our knowledge\nin important ways.\nOther Traits Beyond the Five-Factor Model Personality Traits 351\nDespite the popularity of the Five-Factor Model, it is certainly not the only model that exists.\nSome suggest that there are more than five major traits, or perhaps even fewer. For example,\nin one of the first comprehensive models to be proposed, Hans Eysenck suggested that\nExtraversion and Neuroticism are most important. Eysenck believed that by combining\npeople\u2019s standing on these two major traits, we could account for many of the differences in\npersonality that we see in people (Eysenck, 1981). So for instance, a neurotic introvert would\nbe shy and nervous, while a stable introvert might avoid social situations and prefer solitary\nactivities, but he may do so with a calm, steady attitude and little anxiety or emotion.\nInterestingly, Eysenck attempted to link these two major dimensions to underlying differences\nin people\u2019s biology. For instance, he suggested that introverts experienced too much sensory\nstimulation and arousal, which made them want to seek out quiet settings and less stimulating\nenvironments. More recently, Jeffrey Gray suggested that these two broad traits are related\nto fundamental reward and avoidance systems in the brain\u2014extraverts might be motivated\nto seek reward and thus exhibit assertive, reward-seeking behavior, whereas people high in\nneuroticism might be motivated to avoid punishment and thus may experience anxiety as a\nresult of their heightened awareness of the threats in the world around them (Gray, 1981.\nThis model has since been updated; see Gray & McNaughton, 2000). These early theories\nhave led to a burgeoning interest in identifying the physiological underpinnings of the\nindividual differences that we observe.\nAnother revision of the Big Five is the HEXACO model of traits (Ashton & Lee, 2007). This model\nis similar to the Big Five, but it posits slightly different versions of some of the traits, and its\nproponents argue that one important class of individual differences was omitted from the\nFive-Factor Model. The HEXACO adds Honesty-Humility as a sixth dimension of personality.\nPeople high in this trait are sincere, fair, and modest, whereas those low in the trait are\nmanipulative, narcissistic, and self-centered. Thus, trait theorists are agreed that personality\ntraits are important in understanding behavior, but there are still debates on the exact number\nand composition of the traits that are most important.\nThere are other important traits that are not included in comprehensive models like the Big\nFive. Although the five factors capture much that is important about personality, researchers\nhave suggested other traits that capture interesting aspects of our behavior. In Figure 5 below\nwe present just a few, out of hundreds, of the other traits that have been studied by\npersonologists.\nNot all of the above traits are currently popular with scientists, yet each of them has\nexperienced popularity in the past. Although the Five-Factor Model has been the target of\nmore rigorous research than some of the traits above, these additional personality\ncharacteristics give a good idea of the wide range of behaviors and attitudes that traits can Personality Traits 352\nFigure 5. Other Traits Beyond Those Included in the Big Five\ncover.\nThe Person-Situation Debate and Alternatives to the Trait Perspective\nThe ideas described in this module should probably seem familiar, if not obvious to you. When\nasked to think about what our friends, enemies, family members, and colleagues are like,\nsome of the first things that come to mind are their personality characteristics. We might think Personality Traits 353\nabout how warm and helpful our first\nteacher was, how irresponsible and\ncareless our brother is, or how\ndemanding and insulting our first\nboss was. Each of these descriptors\nreflects a personality trait, and most\nof us generally think that the\ndescriptions that we use for\nindividuals accurately reflect their\n\u201ccharacteristic pattern of thoughts,\nfeelings, and behaviors,\u201d or in other\nThe way people behave is only, in part, a product of their natural words, their personality.\npersonality. Situations also influence how a person behaves. [Photo:\nwoodleywonderworks]\nBut what if this idea were wrong?\nWhat if our belief in personality traits were an illusion and people are not consistent from one\nsituation to the next? This was a possibility that shook the foundation of personality psychology\nin the late 1960s when Walter Mischel published a book called Personality and Assessment\n(1968). In this book, Mischel suggested that if one looks closely at people\u2019s behavior across\nmany different situations, the consistency is really not that impressive. In other words, children\nwho cheat on tests at school may steadfastly follow all rules when playing games and may\nnever tell a lie to their parents. In other words, he suggested, there may not be any general\ntrait of honesty that links these seemingly related behaviors. Furthermore, Mischel suggested\nthat observers may believe that broad personality traits like honesty exist, when in fact, this\nbelief is an illusion. The debate that followed the publication of Mischel\u2019s book was called the\nperson-situation debate because it pitted the power of personality against the power of\nsituational factors as determinants of the behavior that people exhibit.\nBecause of the findings that Mischel emphasized, many psychologists focused on an\nalternative to the trait perspective. Instead of studying broad, context-free descriptions, like\nthe trait terms we\u2019ve described so far, Mischel thought that psychologists should focus on\npeople\u2019s distinctive reactions to specific situations. For instance, although there may not be\na broad and general trait of honesty, some children may be especially likely to cheat on a test\nwhen the risk of being caught is low and the rewards for cheating are high. Others might be\nmotivated by the sense of risk involved in cheating and may do so even when the rewards\nare not very high. Thus, the behavior itself results from the child\u2019s unique evaluation of the\nrisks and rewards present at that moment, along with her evaluation of her abilities and values.\nBecause of this, the same child might act very differently in different situations. Thus, Mischel\nthought that specific behaviors were driven by the interaction between very specific,\npsychologically meaningful features of the situation in which people found themselves, the Personality Traits 354\nperson\u2019s unique way of perceiving that situation, and his or her abilities for dealing with it.\nMischel and others argued that it was these social-cognitive processes that underlie people\u2019s\nreactions to specific situations that provide some consistency when situational features are\nthe same. If so, then studying these broad traits might be more fruitful than cataloging and\nmeasuring narrow, context-free traits like Extraversion or Neuroticism.\nIn the years after the publication of Mischel\u2019s (1968) book, debates raged about whether\npersonality truly exists, and if so, how it should be studied. And, as is often the case, it turns\nout that a more moderate middle ground than what the situationists proposed could be\nreached. It is certainly true, as Mischel pointed out, that a person\u2019s behavior in one specific\nsituation is not a good guide to how that person will behave in a very different specific situation.\nSomeone who is extremely talkative at one specific party may sometimes be reticent to speak\nup during class and may even act like a wallflower at a different party. But this does not mean\nthat personality does not exist, nor does it mean that people\u2019s behavior is completely\ndetermined by situational factors. Indeed, research conducted after the person-situation\ndebate shows that on average, the effect of the \u201csituation\u201d is about as large as that of\npersonality traits. However, it is also true that if psychologists assess a broad range of\nbehaviors across many different situations, there are general tendencies that emerge.\nPersonality traits give an indication about how people will act on average, but frequently they\nare not so good at predicting how a person will act in a specific situation at a certain moment\nin time. Thus, to best capture broad traits, one must assess aggregate behaviors, averaged\nover time and across many different types of situations. Most modern personality researchers\nagree that there is a place for broad personality traits and for the narrower units such as those\nstudied by Walter Mischel.\nAppendix\nThe Mini-IPIP Scale\n(Donnellan, Oswald, Baird, & Lucas, 2006)\nInstructions: Below are phrases describing people\u2019s behaviors. Please use the rating scale\nbelow to describe how accurately each statement describes you. Describe yourself as you\ngenerally are now, not as you wish to be in the future. Describe yourself as you honestly see\nyourself, in relation to other people you know of the same sex as you are, and roughly your\nsame age. Please read each statement carefully, and put a number from 1 to 5 next to it to\ndescribe how accurately the statement describes you. Personality Traits 355\n1 = Very inaccurate\n2 = Moderately inaccurate\n3 = Neither inaccurate nor accurate\n4 = Moderately accurate\n5 = Very accurate\n1. _______ Am the life of the party (E)\n2. _______ Sympathize with others\u2019 feelings (A)\n3. _______ Get chores done right away (C)\n4. _______ Have frequent mood swings (N)\n5. _______ Have a vivid imagination (O)\n6. _______Don\u2019t talk a lot (E)\n7. _______ Am not interested in other people\u2019s problems (A)\n8. _______ Often forget to put things back in their proper place (C)\n9. _______ Am relaxed most of the time (N)\n10. ______ Am not interested in abstract ideas (O)\n11. ______ Talk to a lot of different people at parties (E)\n12. ______ Feel others\u2019 emotions (A)\n13. ______ Like order (C)\n14. ______ Get upset easily (N)\n15. ______ Have difficulty understanding abstract ideas (O)\n16. ______ Keep in the background (E)\n17. ______ Am not really interested in others (A)\n18. ______ Make a mess of things (C)\n19. ______ Seldom feel blue (N)\n20. ______ Do not have a good imagination (O)\nScoring: The first thing you must do is to reverse the items that are worded in the opposite Personality Traits 356\ndirection. In order to do this, subtract the number you put for that item from 6. So if you put\na 4, for instance, it will become a 2. Cross out the score you put when you took the scale, and\nput the new number in representing your score subtracted from the number 6.\nItems to be reversed in this way: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\nNext, you need to add up the scores for each of the five OCEAN scales (including the reversed\nnumbers where relevant). Each OCEAN score will be the sum of four items. Place the sum\nnext to each scale below.\n__________ Openness: Add items 5, 10, 15, 20\n__________ Conscientiousness: Add items 3, 8, 13, 18\n__________ Extraversion: Add items 1, 6, 11, 16\n__________ Agreeableness: Add items 2, 7, 12, 17\n__________ Neuroticism: Add items 4, 9,14, 19\nCompare your scores to the norms below to see where you stand on each scale. If you are\nlow on a trait, it means you are the opposite of the trait label. For example, low on Extraversion\nis Introversion, low on Openness is Conventional, and low on Agreeableness is Assertive.\n19\u201320 Extremely High, 17\u201318 Very High, 14\u201316 High,\n11\u201313 Neither high nor low; in the middle, 8\u201310 Low, 6\u20137 Very low, 4\u20135 Extremely low Personality Traits 357\nOutside Resources\nWeb: International Personality Item Pool\nhttp://ipip.ori.org/\nWeb: John Johnson personality scales\nhttp://www.personal.psu.edu/j5j/IPIP/ipipneo120.htm\nWeb: Personality trait systems compared\nhttp://www.personalityresearch.org/bigfive/goldberg.html\nWeb: Sam Gosling website\nhttp://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/faculty/gosling/samgosling.htm\nDiscussion Questions\n1. Consider different combinations of the Big Five, such as O (Low), C (High), E (Low), A (High),\nand N (Low). What would this person be like? Do you know anyone who is like this? Can\nyou select politicians, movie stars, and other famous people and rate them on the Big Five?\n2. How do you think learning and inherited personality traits get combined in adult\npersonality?\n3. Can you think of instances where people do not act consistently\u2014where their personality\ntraits are not good predictors of their behavior?\n4. Has your personality changed over time, and in what ways?\n5. Can you think of a personality trait not mentioned in this module that describes how people\ndiffer from one another?\n6. When do extremes in personality traits become harmful, and when are they unusual but\nproductive of good outcomes? Personality Traits 358\nVocabulary\nAgreeableness\nA personality trait that reflects a person\u2019s tendency to be compassionate, cooperative, warm,\nand caring to others. People low in agreeableness tend to be rude, hostile, and to pursue their\nown interests over those of others.\nConscientiousness\nA personality trait that reflects a person\u2019s tendency to be careful, organized, hardworking, and\nto follow rules.\nContinuous distributions\nCharacteristics can go from low to high, with all different intermediate values possible. One\ndoes not simply have the trait or not have it, but can possess varying amounts of it.\nExtraversion\nA personality trait that reflects a person\u2019s tendency to be sociable, outgoing, active, and\nassertive.\nFacets\nBroad personality traits can be broken down into narrower facets or aspects of the trait. For\nexample, extraversion has several facets, such as sociability, dominance, risk-taking and so\nforth.\nFactor analysis\nA statistical technique for grouping similar things together according to how highly they are\nassociated.\nFive-Factor Model\n(also called the Big Five) The Five-Factor Model is a widely accepted model of personality traits.\nAdvocates of the model believe that much of the variability in people\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and\nbehaviors can be summarized with five broad traits. These five traits are Openness,\nConscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.\nHEXACO model\nThe HEXACO model is an alternative to the Five-Factor Model. The HEXACO model includes\nsix traits, five of which are variants of the traits included in the Big Five (Emotionality [E],\nExtraversion [X], Agreeableness [A], Conscientiousness [C], and Openness [O]). The sixth Personality Traits 359\nfactor, Honesty-Humility [H], is unique to this model.\nIndependent\nTwo characteristics or traits are separate from one another-- a person can be high on one\nand low on the other, or vice-versa. Some correlated traits are relatively independent in that\nalthough there is a tendency for a person high on one to also be high on the other, this is not\nalways the case.\nLexical hypothesis\nThe lexical hypothesis is the idea that the most important differences between people will be\nencoded in the language that we use to describe people. Therefore, if we want to know which\npersonality traits are most important, we can look to the language that people use to describe\nthemselves and others.\nNeuroticism\nA personality trait that reflects the tendency to be interpersonally sensitive and the tendency\nto experience negative emotions like anxiety, fear, sadness, and anger.\nOpenness to Experience\nA personality trait that reflects a person\u2019s tendency to seek out and to appreciate new things,\nincluding thoughts, feelings, values, and experiences.\nPersonality\nEnduring predispositions that characterize a person, such as styles of thought, feelings and\nbehavior.\nPersonality traits\nEnduring dispositions in behavior that show differences across individuals, and which tend\nto characterize the person across varying types of situations.\nPerson-situation debate\nThe person-situation debate is a historical debate about the relative power of personality\ntraits as compared to situational influences on behavior. The situationist critique, which\nstarted the person-situation debate, suggested that people overestimate the extent to which\npersonality traits are consistent across situations.

The\npsychodynamic perspective has evolved considerably since Freud\u2019s time, and now includes\ninnovative new approaches such as object relations theory and neuropsychoanalysis. Some\npsychodynamic concepts have held up well to empirical scrutiny while others have not, and\naspects of the theory remain controversial, but the psychodynamic perspective continues to\ninfluence many different areas of contemporary psychology.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Describe the major models of personality within the psychodynamic perspective.\n\u2022 Define the concept of ego defense, and give examples of commonly used ego defenses.\n\u2022 Identify psychodynamic concepts that have been supported by empirical research.\n\u2022 Discuss current trends in psychodynamic theory.\nIntroduction\nHave you ever done something that didn\u2019t make sense? Perhaps you waited until the last\nminute to begin studying for an exam, even though you knew that delaying so long would\nensure that you got a poor grade. Or maybe you spotted a person you liked across the room\n\u2014someone about whom you had romantic feelings\u2014but instead of approaching that person The Psychodynamic Perspective 362\nyou headed the other way (and felt\nashamed about it afterward). If\nyou\u2019ve ever done something that\ndidn\u2019t seem to make sense\u2014and\nwho among us hasn\u2019t\u2014the psych\u00ad\nodynamic perspective on personality\nmight be useful for you. It can help\nyou understand why you chose\nnot to study for that test, or why\nyou ran the other way when the\nperson of your dreams entered\nthe room.\nAccording to psychodynamic theory, a lot of our behaviors and preferences\nof adulthood are shaped by the experiences in our childhood. [Image:\nPsychodynamic theory (sometimes\naiesecinternational]\ncalled psychoanalytic theory) explains\npersonality in terms of unconscious psychological processes (for example, wishes and fears\nof which we\u2019re not fully aware), and contends that childhood experiences are crucial in shaping\nadult personality. Psychodynamic theory is most closely associated with the work of Sigmund\nFreud, and with psychoanalysis, a type of psychotherapy that attempts to explore the patient\u2019s\nunconscious thoughts and emotions so that the person is better able to understand him- or\nherself.\nFreud\u2019s work has been extremely influential, its impact extending far beyond psychology\n(several years ago Time magazine selected Freud as one of the most important thinkers of the\n20th century). Freud\u2019s work has been not only influential, but quite controversial as well. As\nyou might imagine, when Freud suggested in 1900 that much of our behavior is determined\nby psychological forces of which we\u2019re largely unaware\u2014that we literally don\u2019t know what\u2019s\ngoing on in our own minds\u2014people were (to put it mildly) displeased (Freud, 1900/1953a).\nWhen he suggested in 1905 that we humans have strong sexual feelings from a very early\nage, and that some of these sexual feelings are directed toward our parents, people were\nmore than displeased\u2014they were outraged (Freud, 1905/1953b). Few theories in psychology\nhave evoked such strong reactions from other professionals and members of the public.\nControversy notwithstanding, no competent psychologist, or student of psychology, can\nignore psychodynamic theory. It is simply too important for psychological science and practice,\nand continues to play an important role in a wide variety of disciplines within and outside\npsychology (for example, developmental psychology, social psychology, sociology, and\nneuroscience; see Bornstein, 2005, 2006; Solms & Turnbull, 2011). This module reviews the\npsychodynamic perspective on personality. We begin with a brief discussion of the core The Psychodynamic Perspective 363\nassumptions of psychodynamic theory, followed by an overview of the evolution of the theory\nfrom Freud\u2019s time to today. We then discuss the place of psychodynamic theory within\ncontemporary psychology, and look toward the future as well.\nCore Assumptions of the Psychodynamic Perspective\nThe core assumptions of psychodynamic theory are surprisingly simple. Moreover, these\nassumptions are unique to the psychodynamic framework: No other theories of personality\naccept these three ideas in their purest form.\nAssumption 1:Primacy of the Unconscious\nPsychodynamic theorists contend that the majority of psychological processes take place\noutside conscious awareness. In psychoanalytic terms, the activities of the mind (or psyche)\nare presumed to be largely unconscious. Research confirms this basic premise of\npsychoanalysis: Many of our mental activities\u2014memories, motives, feelings, and the like\u2014\nare largely inaccessible to consciousness (Bargh & Morsella, 2008; Bornstein, 2010; Wilson,\n2009).\nAssumption 2: Critical Importance of Early Experiences\nPsychodynamic theory is not alone in positing that early childhood events play a role in shaping\npersonality, but the theory is unique in the degree to which it emphasizes these events as\ndeterminants of personality development and dynamics. According to the psychodynamic\nmodel, early experiences\u2014including those occurring during the first weeks or months of life\n\u2014set in motion personality processes that affect us years, even decades, later (Blatt & Levy,\n2003; McWilliams, 2009). This is especially true of experiences that are outside the normal\nrange (for example, losing a parent or sibling at a very early age).\nAssumption 3: Psychic Causality\nThe third core assumption of psychodynamic theory is that nothing in mental life happens by\nchance\u2014that there is no such thing as a random thought, feeling, motive, or behavior. This\nhas come to be known as the principle of psychic causality, and though few psychologists\naccept the principle of psychic causality precisely as psychoanalysts conceive it, most theorists\nand researchers agree that thoughts, motives, emotional responses, and expressed behaviors\ndo not arise randomly, but always stem from some combination of identifiable biological and The Psychodynamic Perspective 364\npsychological processes (Elliott,\n2002; Robinson & Gordon, 2011).\nThe Evolution of\nPsychodynamic Theory\nGiven Freud\u2019s background in\nneurology, it is not surprising that\nthe first incarnation of psychoanalytic\ntheory was primarily biological:\nFreud set out to explain\nOur every thought and behavior \u2014even something as seemingly random as\npsychological phenomena in\nwhich hiking trail to take or which rock to sit on\u2014results from biological or\nterms that could be linked to\npsychological influences. [Image: Trekking Rinjani]\nneurological functioning as it was\nunderstood in his day. Because Freud\u2019s work in this area evolved over more than 50 years\n(he began in 1885, and continued until he died in 1939), there were numerous revisions along\nthe way. Thus, it is most accurate to think of psychodynamic theory as a set of interrelated\nmodels that complement and build upon each other. Three are particularly important: the\ntopographic model, the psychosexual stage model, and the structural model.\nThe Topographic Model\nIn his 1900 book, The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud introduced his topographic model of the\nmind, which contended that the mind could be divided into three regions: conscious,\npreconscious, and unconscious. The conscious part of the mind holds information that you\u2019re\nfocusing on at this moment\u2014what you\u2019re thinking and feeling right now. The preconscious\ncontains material that is capable of becoming conscious but is not conscious at the moment\nbecause your attention is not being directed toward it. You can move material from the\npreconscious into consciousness simply by focusing your attention on it. Consider, for\nexample, what you had for dinner last night. A moment ago that information was\npreconscious; now it\u2019s conscious, because you \u201cpulled it up\u201d into consciousness. (Not to worry,\nin a few moments it will be preconscious again, and you can move on to more important things.)\nThe unconscious\u2014the most controversial part of the topographic model\u2014contains anxiety-\nproducing material (for example, sexual impulses, aggressive urges) that are deliberately\nrepressed (held outside of conscious awareness as a form of self-protection because they make\nyou uncomfortable). The terms conscious, preconscious, and unconscious continue to be used The Psychodynamic Perspective 365\ntoday in psychology, and\nresearch has provided consi\u00ad\nderable support for Freud\u2019s\nthinking regarding conscious\nand preconscious processing\n(Erdelyi, 1985, 2004). The\nexistence of the unconscious\nremains controversial, with\nsome researchers arguing\nthat evidence for it is\ncompelling and others contending\nthat \u201cunconscious\u201d processing\nDreams play an important role in psychodynamic theory, as they are often\ncan be accounted for without\nconsidered the central route through which the unconscious expresses itself to\npositing the existence of a\nthe conscious mind. [Image: Hartwig HKD]\nFreudian repository of repressed\nwishes and troubling urges and impulses (Eagle, 2011; Luborsky & Barrett, 2006).\nThe Psychosexual Stage Model\nFreud remained devoted to the topographic model, but by 1905 he had outlined the key\nelements of his psychosexual stage model, which argued that early in life we progress through\na sequence of developmental stages, each with its own unique challenge and its own mode\nof sexual gratification. Freud\u2019s psychosexual stages\u2014oral, anal, Oedipal, latency, and genital\n\u2014are well-known even to non-analytic psychologists. Frustration or overgratification during\na particular stage was hypothesized to result in \u201cfixation\u201d at that stage, and to the development\nof an oral, anal, or Oedipal personality style (Bornstein, 2005, 2006).\nTable 1 illustrates the basic organization of Freud\u2019s (1905/1953b) psychosexual stage model,\nand the three personality styles that result. Note that\u2014consistent with the developmental\nchallenges that the child confronts during each stage\u2014oral fixation is hypothesized to result\nin a dependent personality, whereas anal fixation results in a lifelong preoccupation with\ncontrol. Oedipal fixation leads to an aggressive, competitive personality orientation.\nThe Structural Model\nUltimately, Freud recognized that the topographic model was helpful in understanding how\npeople process and store information, but not all that useful in explaining other important\npsychological phenomena (for example, why certain people develop psychological disorders The Psychodynamic Perspective 366\nand others do not). To extend his theory, Freud developed a complementary framework to\naccount for normal and abnormal personality development\u2014the structural model\u2014which\nposits the existence of three interacting mental structures called the id, ego, and superego.\nThe id is the seat of drives and instincts, whereas the ego represents the logical, reality-oriented\npart of the mind, and the superego is basically your conscience\u2014the moral guidelines, rules,\nand prohibitions that guide your behavior. (You acquire these through your family and through\nthe culture in which you were raised.)\nAccording to the structural model, our personality reflects the interplay of these three psychic\nstructures, which differ across individuals in relative power and influence. When the id\npredominates and instincts rule, the result is an impulsive personality style. When the\nsuperego is strongest, moral prohibitions reign supreme, and a restrained, overcontrolled\npersonality ensues. When the ego is dominant, a more balanced set of personality traits\ndevelop (Eagle, 2011; McWilliams, 2009).\nThe Ego and Its Defenses\nIn addition to being the logical, rational, reality-oriented part of the mind, the ego serves\nanother important function: It helps us manage anxiety through the use of ego defenses.\nEgo defenses are basically mental strategies that we use automatically and unconsciously\nwhen we feel threatened (Cramer, 2000, 2006). They help us navigate upsetting events, but\nthere\u2019s a cost as well: All ego defenses involve some distortion of reality. For example,\nrepression (the most basic ego defense, according to Freud) involves removing from\nconsciousness upsetting thoughts and feelings, and moving those thoughts and feelings to\nthe unconscious. When you read about a person who \u201cblocked out\u201d upsetting memories of\nchild abuse, that\u2019s an example of repression.\nAnother ego defense is denial. In denial (unlike repression), we are aware that a particular\nevent occurred, but we don\u2019t allow ourselves to see the implications of that event. When you\nhear a person with a substance abuse problem say \u201cI\u2019m fine\u2014even though people complain\nabout my drinking I never miss a day of work,\u201d that person is using denial. Table 2 lists some\ncommon ego defenses in psychodynamic theory, along with a definition and example of each.\nPsychodynamic Theories: Where Are We Now?\nThe topographic model, psychosexual stage model, and structural model continue to influence\ncontemporary psychology, but it is important to keep in mind that psychodynamic theory is\nnever static, ever changing and evolving in response to new ideas and findings. In the following The Psychodynamic Perspective 367\nsections we discussion four current trends in the psychodynamic perspective: object relations\ntheory, the empirical testing of psychodynamic concepts, psychoanalysis and culture, and the\nopportunities and challenges of neuroscience.\nObject Relations Theory and the Growth of the Psychodynamic\nPerspective\nIn recent years a number of new\npsychodynamic frameworks have\nemerged to explain personality\ndevelopment and dynamics. The\nmost important of these is object\nrelations theory. (In psychoanalytic\nlanguage, the term \u201cobject\u201d refers to\na person, so object relations theory\nis really something more like\n\u201cinterpersonal relations theory.\u201d)\nObject relations theory contends\nWe first learn how to interact with people as children. And depending on\nthat personality can be understood\nthose experiences, it will guide our expectations for how future\nas reflecting the mental images of\nrelationship interactions will go. [Image: Vincent Anderlucci]\nsignificant figures (especially the\nparents) that we form early in life in response to interactions taking place within the family\n(Kernberg, 2004; Wachtel, 1997). These mental images (sometimes called introjects) serve as\ntemplates for later interpersonal relationships\u2014almost like relationship blueprints or\n\u201cscripts.\u201d So if you internalized positive introjects early in life (for example, a mental image of\nmom or dad as warm and accepting), that\u2019s what you expect to occur in later relationships as\nwell. If you internalized a mental image of mom or dad as harsh and judgmental, you might\ninstead become a self-critical person, and feel that you can never live up to other people\u2019s\nstandards . . . or your own (Luyten & Blatt, 2013).\nObject relations theory has increased many psychologists\u2019 interest in studying psychodynamic\nideas and concepts, in part because it represents a natural bridge between the psychodynamic\nperspective and research in other areas of psychology. For example, developmental and social\npsychologists also believe that mental representations of significant people play an important\nrole in shaping our behavior. In developmental psychology you might read about this in the\ncontext of attachment theory (which argues that attachments\u2014or bonds\u2014to significant people\nare key to understanding human behavior; Fraley, 2002). In social psychology, mental The Psychodynamic Perspective 368\nrepresentations of significant figures play an important role in social cognition (thoughts and\nfeelings regarding other people; Bargh & Morsella, 2008; Robinson & Gordon, 2011).\nEmpirical Research on Psychodynamic Theories\nEmpirical research assessing psychodynamic concepts has produced mixed results, with some\nconcepts receiving good empirical support, and others not faring as well. For example, the\nnotion that we express strong sexual feelings from a very early age, as the psychosexual stage\nmodel suggests, has not held up to empirical scrutiny. On the other hand, the idea that there\nare dependent, control-oriented, and competitive personality types\u2014an idea also derived\nfrom the psychosexual stage model\u2014does seem useful.\nMany ideas from the psychodynamic perspective have been studied empirically. Luborsky\nand Barrett (2006) reviewed much of this research; other useful reviews are provided by\nBornstein (2005), Gerber (2007), and Huprich (2009). For now, let\u2019s look at three psychodynamic\nhypotheses that have received strong empirical support.\n\u2022 Unconscious processes influence our behavior as the psychodynamic perspective predicts. We\nperceive and process much more information than we realize, and much of our behavior\nis shaped by feelings and motives of which we are, at best, only partially aware (Bornstein,\n2009, 2010). Evidence for the importance of unconscious influences is so compelling that\nit has become a central element of contemporary cognitive and social psychology (Robinson\n& Gordon, 2011).\n\u2022 We all use ego defenses and they help determine our psychological adjustment and physical\nhealth. People really do differ in the degree that they rely on different ego defenses\u2014so\nmuch so that researchers now study each person\u2019s \u201cdefense style\u201d (the unique constellation\nof defenses that we use). It turns out that certain defenses are more adaptive than others:\nRationalization and sublimation are healthier (psychologically speaking) than repression\nand reaction formation (Cramer, 2006). Denial is, quite literally, bad for your health, because\npeople who use denial tend to ignore symptoms of illness until it\u2019s too late (Bond, 2004).\n\u2022 Mental representations of self and others do indeed serve as blueprints for later relationships.\nDozens have studies have shown that mental images of our parents, and other significant\nfigures, really do shape our expectations for later friendships and romantic relationships.\nThe idea that you choose a romantic partner who resembles mom or dad is a myth, but\nit\u2019s true that you expect to be treated by others as you were treated by your parents early\nin life (Silverstein, 2007; Wachtel, 1997). The Psychodynamic Perspective 369\nPsychoanalysis and Culture\nOne of Freud\u2019s lifelong goals was to\nuse psychoanalytic principles to\nunderstand culture and improve\nintergroup relations (he actually\nexchanged several letters with\nAlbert Einstein prior to World War\nII, in which they discussed this\nissue). During the past several\ndecades, as society has become\nincreasingly multicultural, this effort\nhas taken on new importance;\npsychoanalysts have been active in\nIf you were to describe yourself, would you focus on your personal incorporating ideas and findings\npreferences and hobbies? Or would you focus on your relationships and regarding cultural influences into\nties with others? [Image: Rose Physical Therapy Group] their research and clinical work. For\nexample, studies have shown that\nindividuals raised in individualistic, independence-focused cultures (for example, the United\nStates, Great Britain) tend to define themselves primarily in terms of personal attributes (like\nattitudes and interests), whereas individuals raised in more sociocentric, interdependent\ncultures (for example, Japan, India) are more likely to describe themselves in terms of\ninterpersonal relations and connections with others (Oyserman, Coon, & Kemmelmeier, 2002).\nOur self-representations are, quite literally, a product of our cultural milieu (Markus &\nKitayama, 2010).\nThe Opportunities and Challenges of Neuroscience\nFifteen years ago, Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel (1998) articulated a vision for an empirically\noriented psychodynamic perspective firmly embedded within the principles and findings of\nneuroscience. Kandel\u2019s vision ultimately led to the development of neuropsychoanalysis, an\nintegration of psychodynamic and neuropsychological concepts that has enhanced\nresearchers\u2019 understanding of numerous aspects of human behavior and mental functioning\n(Solms & Turnbull, 2011). Some of the first efforts to integrate psychodynamic principles with\nfindings from neuroscience involved sleep and dreams, and contemporary models of dream\nformation now incorporate principles from both domains (Levin & Nielsen, 2007).\nNeuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI) have begun\nto play an increasingly central role in this ongoing psychoanalysis\u2013neuroscience integration The Psychodynamic Perspective 370\nas well (Gerber, 2007; Slipp, 2000).\nLooking Ahead: Psychodynamic Theory in the 21st Century (and\nBeyond)\nDespite being surrounded by controversy, the psychodynamic perspective on personality has\nsurvived for more than a century, reinventing itself in response to new empirical findings,\ntheoretical shifts, and changing social forces. The psychodynamic perspective evolved\nconsiderably during the 20th century and will continue to evolve throughout the 21st century\nas well. Psychodynamic theory may be the closest thing we have to an overarching, all-\nencompassing theory in psychology. It deals with a broad range of issues\u2014normal and\npathological functioning, motivation and emotion, childhood and adulthood, individual and\nculture\u2014and the psychodynamic perspective continues to have tremendous potential for\nintegrating ideas and findings across the many domains of contemporary psychology.\nTable 1: The Psychosexual Stage Model The Psychodynamic Perspective 371\nTable 2: Some Common Ego Defenses The Psychodynamic Perspective 372\nTable 3: Conceptions of Personality within Psychodynamic Theory The Psychodynamic Perspective 373\nOutside Resources\nInstitution: Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research (IPTAR) - A branch of the\nInternational Psychoanalytic Association, IPTAR plays an active role in supporting empirical\nresearch on psychoanalytic theory and therapy.\nhttp://www.iptar.org/\nInstitution: The American Psychoanalytic Association - The American Psychoanalytic\nAssociation supports psychodynamic training and research, and sponsors a number of\nworkshops (as well as two annual meetings) each year.\nhttp://www.apsa.org/\nInstitution: The American Psychological Association Division of Psychoanalysis - Division\n39 of the American Psychological Association is the \u201cpsychological home\u201d of\npsychodynamic theory and research.\nhttp://www.apadivisions.org/division-39/\nWeb: Library of Congress Exhibit \u2013 Freud: Conflict and Culture.

Ellard\nAnxiety is a natural part of life and, at normal levels, helps us to function at our best. However,\nfor people with anxiety disorders, anxiety is overwhelming and hard to control. Anxiety\ndisorders develop out of a blend of biological (genetic) and psychological factors that, when\ncombined with stress, may lead to the development of ailments. Primary anxiety-related\ndiagnoses include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety\ndisorder (social phobia), post traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nIn this module, we summarize the main clinical features of each of these disorders and discuss\ntheir similarities and differences with everyday experiences of anxiety.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Understand the relationship between anxiety and anxiety disorders.\n\u2022 Identify key vulnerabilities for developing anxiety and related disorders.\n\u2022 Identify main diagnostic features of specific anxiety-related disorders.\n\u2022 Differentiate between disordered and non-disordered functioning.\nIntroduction\nWhat is anxiety? Most of us feel some anxiety almost every day of our lives. Maybe you have\nan important test coming up for school. Or maybe there\u2019s that big game next Saturday, or\nthat first date with someone new you are hoping to impress. Anxiety can be defined as a\nnegative mood state that is accompanied by bodily symptoms such as increased heart rate, Anxiety and Related Disorders 381\nmuscle tension, a sense of unease, and apprehension about the future (APA, 2013; Barlow,\n2002).\nAnxiety is what motivates us to plan for\nthe future, and in this sense, anxiety is\nactually a good thing. It\u2019s that nagging\nfeeling that motivates us to study for that\ntest, practice harder for that game, or be\nat our very best on that date. But some\npeople experience anxiety so intensely\nthat it is no longer helpful or useful. They\nmay become so overwhelmed and\ndistracted by anxiety that they actually\nfail their test, fumble the ball, or spend\nthe whole date fidgeting and avoiding While everyone may experience some level of anxiety at one time\neye contact. If anxiety begins to interfere or another, those with anxiety disorders experience it consistently\nand so intensely that it has a significantly negative impact on their\nin the person\u2019s life in a significant way, it\nquality of life. (Photo: Zetson)\nis considered a disorder.\nAnxiety and closely related disorders emerge from \u201ctriple vulnerabilities,\u201da combination of\nbiological, psychological, and specific factors that increase our risk for developing a disorder\n(Barlow, 2002; Su\u00e1rez, Bennett, Goldstein, & Barlow, 2009). Biological vulnerabilities refer to\nspecific genetic and neurobiological factors that might predispose someone to develop anxiety\ndisorders. No single gene directly causes anxiety or panic, but our genes may make us more\nsusceptible to anxiety and influence how our brains react to stress (Drabant et al., 2012;\nGelernter & Stein, 2009; Smoller, Block, & Young, 2009). Psychological vulnerabilities refer\nto the influences that our early experiences have on how we view the world. If we were\nconfronted with unpredictable stressors or traumatic experiences at younger ages, we may\ncome to view the world as unpredictable and uncontrollable, even dangerous (Chorpita &\nBarlow, 1998; Gunnar & Fisher, 2006). Specific vulnerabilities refer to how our experiences\nlead us to focus and channel our anxiety (Su\u00e1rez et al., 2009). If we learned that physical illness\nis dangerous, maybe through witnessing our family\u2019s reaction whenever anyone got sick, we\nmay focus our anxiety on physical sensations. If we learned that disapproval from others has\nnegative, even dangerous consequences, such as being yelled at or severely punished for\neven the slightest offense, we might focus our anxiety on social evaluation. If we learn that\nthe \u201cother shoe might drop\u201d at any moment, we may focus our anxiety on worries about the\nfuture. None of these vulnerabilities directly causes anxiety disorders on its own\u2014instead,\nwhen all of these vulnerabilities are present, and we experience some triggering life stress,\nan anxiety disorder may be the result (Barlow, 2002; Su\u00e1rez et al., 2009). In the next sections, Anxiety and Related Disorders 382\nwe will briefly explore each of the major anxiety based disorders, found in the fifth edition of\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (APA, 2013).\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\nMost of us worry some of the time, and this worry can actually be useful in helping us to plan\nfor the future or make sure we remember to do something important. Most of us can set\naside our worries when we need to focus on other things or stop worrying altogether whenever\na problem has passed. However, for someone with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), these\nworries become difficult, or even impossible, to turn off. They may find themselves worrying\nexcessively about a number of different things, both minor and catastrophic. Their worries\nalso come with a host of other symptoms such as muscle tension, fatigue, agitation or\nrestlessness, irritability, difficulties with sleep (either falling asleep, staying asleep, or both),\nor difficulty concentrating.The DSM-5 criteria specify that at least six months of excessive\nanxiety and worry of this type must be ongoing, happening more days than not for a good\nproportion of the day, to receive a diagnosis of GAD. About 5.7% of the population has met\ncriteria for GAD at some point during their lifetime (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005), making it\none of the most common anxiety disorders (see Table 1).\nTable 1: Prevalence rates for major anxiety disorders. [1] Kessler et al. (2005), [2]Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, & Walters\n(2005), [3]Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, & Nelson (1995), [4]Craske et al. (1996).\nWhat makes a person with GAD worry more than the average person? Research shows that\nindividuals with GAD are more sensitive and vigilant toward possible threats than people who\nare not anxious (Aikins & Craske, 2001; Barlow, 2002; Bradley, Mogg, White, Groom, & de Bono,\n1999). This may be related to early stressful experiences, which can lead to a view of the world Anxiety and Related Disorders 383\nas an unpredictable, uncontrollable, and even dangerous place. Some have suggested that\npeople with GAD worry as a way to gain some control over these otherwise uncontrollable or\nunpredictable experiences and against uncertain outcomes (Dugas, Gagnon, Ladouceur, &\nFreeston, 1998). By repeatedly going through all of the possible \u201cWhat if?\u201d scenarios in their\nmind, the person might feel like they are less vulnerable to an unexpected outcome, giving\nthem the sense that they have some control over the situation (Wells, 2002). Others have\nsuggested people with GAD worry as a way to avoid feeling distressed (Borkovec, Alcaine, &\nBehar, 2004). For example, Borkovec and Hu (1990) found that those who worried when\nconfronted with a stressful situation had less physiological arousal than those who didn\u2019t\nworry, maybe because the worry \u201cdistracted\u201d them in some way.\nThe problem is, all of this \u201cwhat if?\u201d-ing doesn\u2019t get the person any closer to a solution or an\nanswer and, in fact, might take them away from important things they should be paying\nattention to in the moment, such as finishing an important project. Many of the catastrophic\noutcomes people with GAD worry about are very unlikely to happen, so when the catastrophic\nevent doesn\u2019t materialize, the act of worrying gets reinforced (Borkovec, Hazlett-Stevens, &\nDiaz, 1999). For example, if a mother spends all night worrying about whether her teenage\ndaughter will get home safe from a night out and the daughter returns home without incident,\nthe mother could easily attribute her daughter\u2019s safe return to her successful \u201cvigil.\u201d What the\nmother hasn\u2019t learned is that her daughter would have returned home just as safe if she had\nbeen focusing on the movie she was watching with her husband, rather than being\npreoccupied with worries. In this way, the cycle of worry is perpetuated, and, subsequently,\npeople with GAD often miss out on many otherwise enjoyable events in their lives.\nPanic Disorder and Agoraphobia\nHave you ever gotten into a near-accident or been taken by surprise in some way? You may\nhave felt a flood of physical sensations, such as a racing heart, shortness of breath, or tingling\nsensations. This alarm reaction is called the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response (Cannon, 1929) and is\nyour body\u2019s natural reaction to fear, preparing you to either fight or escape in response to\nthreat or danger. It\u2019s likely you weren\u2019t too concerned with these sensations, because you\nknew what was causing them. But imagine if this alarm reaction came \u201cout of the blue,\u201d for\nno apparent reason, or in a situation in which you didn\u2019t expect to be anxious or fearful. This\nis called an \u201cunexpected\u201d panic attack or a false alarm. Because there is no apparent reason\nor cue for the alarm reaction, you might react to the sensations with intense fear, maybe\nthinking you are having a heart attack, or going crazy, or even dying. You might begin to\nassociate the physical sensations you felt during this attack with this fear and may start to go\nout of your way to avoid having those sensations again. Anxiety and Related Disorders 384\nUnexpected panic attacks such as these\nare at the heart of panic disorder (PD).\nHowever, to receive a diagnosis of PD,\nthe person must not only have\nunexpected panic attacks but also must\nexperience continued intense anxiety\nand avoidance related to the attack for\nat least one month, causing significant\ndistress or interference in their lives.\nPeople with panic disorder tend to\ninterpret even normal physical sensations\nPanic disorder is a debilitating condition that leaves sufferers with in a catastrophic way, which triggers\nacute anxiety that persists long after a specific panic attack has more anxiety and, ironically, more\nsubsided. When this anxiety leads to deliberate avoidance of physical sensations, creating a vicious\nparticular places and situations a person may be given a diagnosis\ncycle of panic (Clark, 1986, 1996). The\nof agoraphobia. [Photo: nate steiner]\nperson may begin to avoid a number of\nsituations or activities that produce the same physiological arousal that was present during\nthe beginnings of a panic attack. For example, someone who experienced a racing heart during\na panic attack might avoid exercise or caffeine. Someone who experienced choking sensations\nmight avoid wearing high-necked sweaters or necklaces. Avoidance of these internal bodily\nor somatic cues for panic has been termed interoceptive avoidance (Barlow & Craske, 2007;\nBrown, White, & Barlow, 2005; Craske & Barlow, 2008; Shear et al., 1997).\nThe individual may also have experienced an overwhelming urge to escape during the\nunexpected panic attack. This can lead to a sense that certain places or situations\u2014particularly\nsituations where escape might not be possible\u2014are not \u201csafe.\u201d These situations become\nexternal cues for panic. If the person begins to avoid several places or situations, or still\nendures these situations but does so with a significant amount of apprehension and anxiety,\nthen the person also has agoraphobia (Barlow, 2002; Craske & Barlow, 1988; Craske & Barlow,\n2008). Agoraphobia can cause significant disruption to a person\u2019s life, causing them to go out\nof their way to avoid situations, such as adding hours to a commute to avoid taking the train\nor only ordering take-out to avoid having to enter a grocery store. In one tragic case seen by\nour clinic, a woman suffering from agoraphobia had not left her apartment for 20 years and\nhad spent the past 10 years confined to one small area of her apartment, away from the view\nof the outside. In some cases, agoraphobia develops in the absence of panic attacks and\ntherefor is a separate disorder in DSM-5. But agoraphobia often accompanies panic disorder.\nAbout 4.7% of the population has met criteria for PD or agoraphobia over their lifetime (Kessler,\nChiu, Demler, Merikangas, & Walters, 2005; Kessler et al., 2006) (see Table 1). In all of these Anxiety and Related Disorders 385\ncases of panic disorder, what was once an adaptive natural alarm reaction now becomes a\nlearned, and much feared, false alarm.\nSpecific Phobia\nThe majority of us might have certain things we fear, such as bees, or needles, or heights\n(Myers et al., 1984). But what if this fear is so consuming that you can\u2019t go out on a summer\u2019s\nday, or get vaccines needed to go on a special trip, or visit your doctor in her new office on\nthe 26th floor? To meet criteria for a diagnosis of specific phobia, there must be an irrational\nfear of a specific object or situation that substantially interferes with the person\u2019s ability to\nfunction. For example, a patient at our clinic turned down a prestigious and coveted artist\nresidency because it required spending time near a wooded area, bound to have insects.\nAnother patient purposely left her house two hours early each morning so she could walk\npast her neighbor\u2019s fenced yard before they let their dog out in the morning.\nThe list of possible phobias is staggering, but four major subtypes of specific phobia are\nrecognized: blood-injury-injection (BII) type, situational type (such as planes, elevators, or\nenclosed places), natural environment type for events one may encounter in nature (for\nexample, heights, storms, and water), and animal type.\nA fifth category \u201cother\u201d includes phobias\nthat do not fit any of the four major\nsubtypes (for example, fears of choking,\nvomiting, or contracting an illness). Most\nphobic reactions cause a surge of activity\nin the sympathetic nervous system and\nincreased heart rate and blood\npressure, maybe even a panic attack.\nHowever, people with BII type phobias\nusually experience a marked drop in\nheart rate and blood pressure and may\neven faint. In this way, those with BII\nphobias almost always differ in their Elevators can be a trigger for sufferers of claustrophobia or\nphysiological reaction from people with agoraphobia. (Image: srgpicker)\nother types of phobia (Barlow &\nLiebowitz, 1995; Craske, Antony, & Barlow, 2006; Hofmann, Alpers, & Pauli, 2009; Ost, 1992).\nBII phobia also runs in families more strongly than any phobic disorder we know (Antony &\nBarlow, 2002; Page & Martin, 1998). Specific phobia is one of the most common psychological Anxiety and Related Disorders 386\ndisorders in the United States, with 12.5% of the population reporting a lifetime history of\nfears significant enough to be considered a \u201cphobia\u201d (Arrindell et al., 2003; Kessler, Berglund,\net al., 2005) (see Table 1). Most people who suffer from specific phobia tend to have multiple\nphobias of several types (Hofmann, Lehman, & Barlow, 1997).\nSocial Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\nMany people consider themselves shy, and most people find social evaluation uncomfortable\nat best, or giving a speech somewhat mortifying. Yet, only a small proportion of the population\nfear these types of situations significantly enough to merit a diagnosis of social anxiety\ndisorder (SAD) (APA, 2013). SAD is more than exaggerated shyness (Bogels et al., 2010;\nSchneier et al., 1996). To receive a diagnosis of SAD, the fear and anxiety associated with social\nsituations must be so strong that the person avoids them entirely, or if avoidance is not\npossible, the person endures them with a great deal of distress. Further, the fear and avoidance\nof social situations must get in the way of the person\u2019s daily life, or seriously limit their academic\nor occupational functioning. For example, a patient at our clinic compromised her perfect 4.0\ngrade point average because she could not complete a required oral presentation in one of\nher classes, causing her to fail the course. Fears of negative evaluation might make someone\nrepeatedly turn down invitations to social events or avoid having conversations with people,\nleading to greater and greater isolation.\nThe specific social situations that trigger anxiety and fear range from one-on-one interactions,\nsuch as starting or maintaining a conversation; to performance-based situations, such as\ngiving a speech or performing on stage; to assertiveness, such as asking someone to change\ndisruptive or undesirable behaviors. Fear of social evaluation might even extend to such things\nas using public restrooms, eating in a restaurant, filling out forms in a public place, or even\nreading on a train. Any type of situation that could potentially draw attention to the person\ncan become a feared social situation. For example, one patient of ours went out of her way\nto avoid any situation in which she might have to use a public restroom for fear that someone\nwould hear her in the bathroom stall and think she was disgusting. If the fear is limited to\nperformance-based situations, such as public speaking, a diagnosis of SAD performance only\nis assigned.\nWhat causes someone to fear social situations to such a large extent? The person may have\nlearned growing up that social evaluation in particular can be dangerous, creating a specific\npsychological vulnerability to develop social anxiety (Bruch & Heimberg, 1994; Lieb et al., 2000;\nRapee & Melville, 1997). For example, the person\u2019s caregivers may have harshly criticized and\npunished them for even the smallest mistake, maybe even punishing them physically. Anxiety and Related Disorders 387\nOr, someone might have experienced a social trauma\nthat had lasting effects, such as being bullied or\nhumiliated. Interestingly, one group of researchers\nfound that 92% of adults in their study sample with\nsocial phobia experienced severe teasing and bullying\nin childhood, compared with only 35% to 50% among\npeople with other anxiety disorders (McCabe, Antony,\nSummerfeldt, Liss, & Swinson, 2003). Someone else\nmight react so strongly to the anxiety provoked by a\nsocial situation that they have an unexpected panic\nattack. This panic attack then becomes associated\n(conditioned response) with the social situation,\ncausing the person to fear they will panic the next time\nthey are in that situation. This is not considered PD,\nhowever, because the person\u2019s fear is more focused\non social evaluation than having unexpected panic\nattacks, and the fear of having an attack is limited to\nSocial trauma in childhood may have long-lasting\nsocial situations. As many as 12.1% of the general\neffects. (Photo: Chesi - Photos CC)\npopulation suffer from social phobia at some point in\ntheir lives (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005), making it one of the most common anxiety disorders,\nsecond only to specific phobia (see Table 1).\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\nWith stories of war, natural disasters, and physical and sexual assault dominating the news,\nit is clear that trauma is a reality for many people. Many individual traumas that occur every\nday never even make the headlines, such as a car accident, domestic abuse, or the death of\na loved one. Yet, while many people face traumatic events, not everyone who faces a trauma\ndevelops a disorder. Some, with the help of family and friends, are able to recover and continue\non with their lives (Friedman, 2009). For some, however, the months and years following a\ntrauma are filled with intrusive reminders of the event, a sense of intense fear that another\ntraumatic event might occur, or a sense of isolation and emotional numbing. They may engage\nin a host of behaviors intended to protect themselves from being vulnerable or unsafe, such\nas constantly scanning their surroundings to look for signs of potential danger, never sitting\nwith their back to the door, or never allowing themselves to be anywhere alone. This lasting\nreaction to trauma is what characterizes posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nA diagnosis of PTSD begins with the traumatic event itself. An individual must have been Anxiety and Related Disorders 388\nexposed to an event that involves actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence.\nTo receive a diagnosis of PTSD, exposure to the event must include either directly experiencing\nthe event, witnessing the event happening to someone else, learning that the event occurred\nto a close relative or friend, or having repeated or extreme exposure to details of the event\n(such as in the case of first responders). The person subsequently re-experiences the event\nthrough both intrusive memories and nightmares. Some memories may come back so vividly\nthat the person feels like they are experiencing the event all over again, what is known as\nhaving a flashback. The individual may avoid anything that reminds them of the trauma,\nincluding conversations, places, or even specific types of people. They may feel emotionally\nnumb or restricted in their ability to feel, which may interfere in their interpersonal\nrelationships. The person may not be able to remember certain aspects of what happened\nduring the event. They may feel a sense of a foreshortened future, that they will never marry,\nhave a family, or live a long, full life. They may be jumpy or easily startled, hypervigilant to\ntheir surroundings, and quick to anger. The prevalence of PTSD among the population as a\nwhole is relatively low, with 6.8% having experienced PTSD at some point in their life (Kessler,\nBerglund, et al., 2005) (see Table 1). Combat and sexual assault are the most common\nprecipitating traumas (Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, & Nelson, 1995). Whereas PTSD\nwas previously categorized as an Anxiety Disorder, in the most recent version of the DSM\n(DSM-5; APA, 2013) it has been reclassified under the more specific category of Trauma- and\nStressor-Related Disorders.\nA person with PTSD is particularly sensitive to both internal and external cues that serve as\nreminders of their traumatic experience. For example, as we saw in PD, the physical sensations\nof arousal present during the initial trauma can become threatening in and of themselves,\nbecoming a powerful reminder of the event. Someone might avoid watching intense or\nemotional movies in order to prevent the experience of emotional arousal. Avoidance of\nconversations, reminders, or even of the experience of emotion itself may also be an attempt\nto avoid triggering internal cues. External stimuli that were present during the trauma can\nalso become strong triggers. For example, if a woman is raped by a man wearing a red t-shirt,\nshe may develop a strong alarm reaction to the sight of red shirts, or perhaps even more\nindiscriminately to anything with a similar color red. A combat veteran who experienced a\nstrong smell of gasoline during a roadside bomb attack may have an intense alarm reaction\nwhen pumping gas back at home. Individuals with a psychological vulnerability toward viewing\nthe world as uncontrollable and unpredictable may particularly struggle with the possibility\nof additional future, unpredictable traumatic events, fueling their need for hypervigilance and\navoidance, and perpetuating the symptoms of PTSD.\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder Anxiety and Related Disorders 389\nHave you ever had a strange thought pop into your mind, such as picturing the stranger next\nto you naked? Or maybe you walked past a crooked picture on the wall and couldn\u2019t resist\nstraightening it. Most people have occasional strange thoughts and may even engage in some\n\u201ccompulsive\u201d behaviors, especially when they are stressed (Boyer & Li\u00e9nard, 2008; Fullana et\nal., 2009). But for most people, these thoughts are nothing more than a passing oddity, and\nthe behaviors are done (or not done) without a second thought. For someone with obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder (OCD), however, these thoughts and compulsive behaviors don\u2019t just\ncome and go. Instead, strange or unusual thoughts are taken to mean something much more\nimportant and real, maybe even something dangerous or frightening. The urge to engage in\nsome behavior, such as straightening a picture, can become so intense that it is nearly\nimpossible not to carry it out, or causes significant anxiety if it can\u2019t be carried out. Further,\nsomeone with OCD might become preoccupied with the possibility that the behavior wasn\u2019t\ncarried out to completion and feel compelled to repeat the behavior again and again, maybe\nseveral times before they are \u201csatisfied.\u201d\nTo receive a diagnosis of OCD, a person must experience obsessive thoughts and/or\ncompulsions that seem irrational or nonsensical, but that keep coming into their mind. Some\nexamples of obsessions include doubting thoughts (such as doubting a door is locked or an\nappliance is turned off), thoughts of contamination (such as thinking that touching almost\nanything might give you cancer), or aggressive thoughts or images that are unprovoked or\nnonsensical. Compulsions may be carried out in an attempt to neutralize some of these\nthoughts, providing temporary relief from the anxiety the obsessions cause, or they may be\nnonsensical in and of themselves. Either way, compulsions are distinct in that they must be\nrepetitive or excessive, the person feels \u201cdriven\u201d to carry out the behavior, and the person\nfeels a great deal of distress if they can\u2019t engage in the behavior. Some examples of compulsive\nbehaviors are repetitive washing (often in response to contamination obsessions), repetitive\nchecking (locks, door handles, appliances often in response to doubting obsessions), ordering\nand arranging things to ensure symmetry, or doing things according to a specific ritual or\nsequence (such as getting dressed or ready for bed in a specific order). To meet diagnostic\ncriteria for OCD, engaging in obsessions and/or compulsions must take up a significant amount\nof the person\u2019s time, at least an hour per day, and must cause significant distress or impairment\nin functioning. About 1.6% of the population has met criteria for OCD over the course of a\nlifetime (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005) (see Table 1). Whereas OCD was previously categorized\nas an Anxiety Disorder, in the most recent version of the DSM (DSM-5; APA, 2013) it has been\nreclassified under the more specific category of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders.\nPeople with OCD often confuse having an intrusive thought with their potential for carrying\nout the thought. Whereas most people when they have a strange or frightening thought are\nable to let it go, a person with OCD may become \u201cstuck\u201d on the thought and be intensely afraid Anxiety and Related Disorders 390\nthat they might somehow lose\ncontrol and act on it. Or worse,\nthey believe that having the\nthought is just as bad as doing it.\nThis is called thought-action\nfusion. For example, one patient\nof ours was plagued by thoughts\nthat she would cause harm to her\nyoung daughter. She experienced\nintrusive images of throwing hot\ncoffee in her daughter\u2019s face or\npushing her face underwater\nwhen she was giving her a bath.\nWhere does productive organization end and compulsive behavior begin? If\nThese images were so terrifying to\nthe behavior consumes more than an hour per day and causes distress it\nthe patient that she would no\ncan be considered OCD. (Photo: mt_neer man)\nlonger allow herself any physical\ncontact with her daughter and would leave her daughter in the care of a babysitter if her\nhusband or another family was not available to \u201csupervise\u201d her. In reality, the last thing she\nwanted to do was harm her daughter, and she had no intention or desire to act on the\naggressive thoughts and images, nor does anybody with OCD act on these thoughts, but these\nthoughts were so horrifying to her that she made every attempt to prevent herself from the\npotential of carrying them out, even if it meant not being able to hold, cradle, or cuddle her\ndaughter. These are the types of struggles people with OCD face every day.\nTreatments for Anxiety and Related Disorders\nMany successful treatments for anxiety and related disorders have been developed over the\nyears. Medications (anti-anxiety drugs and antidepressants) have been found to be beneficial\nfor disorders other than specific phobia, but relapse rates are high once medications are\nstopped (Heimberg et al., 1998; Hollon et al., 2005), and some classes of medications (minor\ntranquilizers or benzodiazepines) can be habit forming.\nExposure-based cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) are effective psychosocial treatments\nfor anxiety disorders, and many show greater treatment effects than medication in the long\nterm (Barlow, Allen, & Basden, 2007; Barlow, Gorman, Shear, & Woods, 2000). In CBT, patients\nare taught skills to help identify and change problematic thought processes, beliefs, and\nbehaviors that tend to worsen symptoms of anxiety, and practice applying these skills to real-\nlife situations through exposure exercises. Patients learn how the automatic \u201cappraisals\u201d or Anxiety and Related Disorders 391\nthoughts they have about a situation affect\nboth how they feel and how they behave.\nSimilarly, patients learn how engaging in\ncertain behaviors, such as avoiding situations,\ntends to strengthen the belief that the\nsituation is something to be feared. A key\naspect of CBT is exposure exercises, in which\nthe patient learns to gradually approach\nsituations they find fearful or distressing, in\norder to challenge their beliefs and learn new,\nless fearful associations about these\nsituations.\nTypically 50% to 80% of patients receiving\ndrugs or CBT will show a good initial response,\nwith the effect of CBT more durable. Newer\ndevelopments in the treatment of anxiety\ndisorders are focusing on novel interventions,\nExposure-based CBT aims to help patients recognize and such as the use of certain medications to\nchange problematic thoughts and behaviors in real-life enhance learning during CBT (Otto et al.,\nsituations. A person with a fear of elevators would be\n2010), and transdiagnostic treatments targeting\nencouraged to practice exposure exercises that might\ncore, underlying vulnerabilities (Barlow et al.,\ninvolve approaching or riding elevators to attempt to\n2011). As we advance our understanding of\novercome their anxiety. [Photo: tatejohnson]\nanxiety and related disorders, so too will our\ntreatments advance, with the hopes that for the many people suffering from these disorders,\nanxiety can once again become something useful and adaptive, rather than something\ndebilitating.

Mood disorders are extended\nperiods of depressed, euphoric, or irritable moods that in combination with other symptoms\ncause the person significant distress and interfere with his or her daily life, often resulting in\nsocial and occupational difficulties. In this module, we describe major mood disorders,\nincluding their symptom presentations, general prevalence rates, and how and why the rates\nof these disorders tend to vary by age, gender, and race. In addition, biological and\nenvironmental risk factors that have been implicated in the development and course of mood\ndisorders, such as heritability and stressful life events, are reviewed. Finally, we provide an\noverview of treatments for mood disorders, covering treatments with demonstrated\neffectiveness, as well as new treatment options showing promise.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Describe the diagnostic criteria for mood disorders.\n\u2022 Understand age, gender, and ethnic differences in prevalence rates of mood disorders.\n\u2022 Identify common risk factors for mood disorders.\n\u2022 Know effective treatments of mood disorders.\nThe actress Brooke Shields published a memoir titled Down Came the Rain: My Journey\nthrough Postpartum Depression in which she described her struggles with depression\nfollowing the birth of her daughter. Despite the fact that about one in 20 women experience Mood Disorders 401\ndepression after the birth of a baby (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013), postpartum\ndepression\u2014recently renamed \u201cperinatal depression\u201d\u2014continues to be veiled by stigma,\nowing in part to a widely held expectation that motherhood should be a time of great joy. In\nan opinion piece in the New York Times, Shields revealed that entering motherhood was a\nprofoundly overwhelming experience for her. She vividly describes experiencing a sense of\n\u201cdoom\u201d and \u201cdread\u201d in response to her newborn baby. Because motherhood is conventionally\nthought of as a joyous event and not associated with sadness and hopelessness, responding\nto a newborn baby in this way can be shocking to the new mother as well as those close to\nher. It may also involve a great deal of shame for the mother, making her reluctant to divulge\nher experience to others, including her doctors and family.\nFeelings of shame are not unique to\nperinatal depression. Stigma applies to\nother types of depressive and bipolar\ndisorders and contributes to people not\nalways receiving the necessary support\nand treatment for these disorders. In fact,\nthe World Health Organization ranks\nboth major depressive disorder (MDD)\nand bipolar disorder (BD) among the top\n10 leading causes of disability worldwide.\nFurther, MDD and BD carry a high risk of\nPerinatal depression following child birth afflicts about 5% of all suicide. It is estimated that 25%\u201350% of\nmothers. An unfortunate social stigma regarding this form of people diagnosed with BD will attempt\ndepression compounds the problem for the women who suffer its\nsuicide at least once in their lifetimes\neffects.

This is different than\nhaving a mood disorder, such as MDD or BD, which are characterized by a constellation of\nsymptoms that causes people significant distress or impairs their everyday functioning.\nMajor Depressive EpisodeA major depressive episode (MDE) refers to symptoms that co-occur\nfor at least two weeks and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning, such as\ninterfering with work, school, or relationships. Core symptoms include feeling down or Mood Disorders 402\ndepressed or experiencing anhedonia\u2014loss of interest or pleasure in things that one typically\nenjoys. According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5; APA, 2013),\nthe criteria for an MDE require five or more of the following nine symptoms, including one or\nboth of the first two symptoms, for most of the day, nearly every day:\n1. depressed mood\n2. diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities\n3. significant weight loss or gain or an increase or decrease in appetite\n4. insomnia or hypersomnia\n5. psychomotor agitation or retardation\n6. fatigue or loss of energy\n7. feeling worthless or excessive or inappropriate guilt\n8. diminished ability to concentrate or indecisiveness\n9. recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or a suicide attempt\nThese symptoms cannot be caused by physiological effects of a substance or a general medical\ncondition (e.g., hypothyroidism).\nManic or Hypomanic EpisodeThe core criterion for a manic or hypomanic episode is a distinct\nperiod of abnormally and persistently euphoric, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently\nincreased goal-directed activity or energy. The mood disturbance must be present for one\nweek or longer in mania (unless hospitalization is required) or four days or longer in\nhypomania. Concurrently, at least three of the following symptoms must be present in the\ncontext of euphoric mood (or at least four in the context of irritable mood):\n1. inflated self-esteem or grandiosity\n2. increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation\n3. reduced need for sleep\n4. racing thoughts or flight of ideas\n5. distractibility\n6. increased talkativeness\n7. excessive involvement in risky behaviors\nManic episodes are distinguished from hypomanic episodes by their duration and associated Mood Disorders 403\nimpairment; whereas manic episodes must last one week and are defined by a significant\nimpairment in functioning, hypomanic episodes are shorter and not necessarily accompanied\nby impairment in functioning.\nMood Disorders\nUnipolar Mood DisordersTwo major types of unipolar disorders described by the DSM-5 (APA,\n2013) are major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder (PDD; dysthymia).\nMDD is defined by one or more MDEs, but no history of manic or hypomanic episodes. Criteria\nfor PDD are feeling depressed most of the day for more days than not, for at least two years.\nAt least two of the following symptoms are also required to meet criteria for PDD:\n1. poor appetite or overeating\n2. insomnia or hypersomnia\n3. low energy or fatigue\n4. low self-esteem\n5. poor concentration or difficulty making decisions\n6. feelings of hopelessness\nLike MDD, these symptoms need to cause significant distress or impairment and cannot be\ndue to the effects of a substance or a general medical condition. To meet criteria for PDD, a\nperson cannot be without symptoms for more than two months at a time. PDD has overlapping\nsymptoms with MDD. If someone\nmeets criteria for an MDE during a\nPDD episode, the person will receive\ndiagnoses of PDD and MDD.\nBipolar Mood DisordersThree major\ntypes of BDs are described by the\nDSM-5 (APA, 2013). Bipolar I Disorder\n(BD I), which was previously known as\nmanic-depression, is characterized by\na single (or recurrent) manic episode.\nA depressive episode is not necessary\nbut commonly present for the\ndiagnosis of BD I. Bipolar II Disorder is Bipolar disorders are characterized by cycles of high energy and\ncharacterized by single (or recurrent) depression. [Photo: arghon] Mood Disorders 404\nhypomanic episodes and depressive episodes. Another type of BD is cyclothymic disorder,\ncharacterized by numerous and alternating periods of hypomania and depression, lasting at\nleast two years. To qualify for cyclothymic disorder, the periods of depression cannot meet\nfull diagnostic criteria for an MDE; the person must experience symptoms at least half the\ntime with no more than two consecutive symptom-free months; and the symptoms must\ncause significant distress or impairment.\nIt is important to note that the DSM-5\nwas published in 2013, and findings\nbased on the updated manual will be\nforthcoming. Consequently, the research\npresented below was largely based on\na similar, but not identical, conceptualization\nof mood disorders drawn from the DSM-\nIV (APA, 2000).\nHow Common Are Mood\nDisorders? Who Develops\nMood Disorders?\nDepressive Disorders\nIn a nationally representative sample,\nlifetime prevalence rate for MDD is\n16.6% (Kessler, Berglund, Demler, Jin,\nMerikangas, & Walters, 2005). This means that nearly one in five Americans will meet the\ncriteria for MDD during their lifetime. The 12-month prevalence\u2014the proportion of people\nwho meet criteria for a disorder during a 12-month period\u2014for PDD is approximately 0.5%\n(APA, 2013).\nAlthough the onset of MDD can occur at any time throughout the lifespan, the average age\nof onset is mid-20s, with the age of onset decreasing with people born more recently (APA,\n2000). Prevalence of MDD among older adults is much lower than it is for younger cohorts\n(Kessler, Birnbaum, Bromet, Hwang, Sampson, & Shahly, 2010). The duration of MDEs varies\nwidely. Recovery begins within three months for 40% of people with MDD and within 12\nmonths for 80% (APA, 2013). MDD tends to be a recurrent disorder with about 40%\u201350% of\nthose who experience one MDE experiencing a second MDE (Monroe & Harkness, 2011). An Mood Disorders 405\nearlier age of onset predicts a worse course. About 5%\u201310% of people who experience an\nMDE will later experience a manic episode (APA, 2000), thus no longer meeting criteria for\nMDD but instead meeting them for BD I. Diagnoses of other disorders across the lifetime are\ncommon for people with MDD: 59% experience an anxiety disorder; 32% experience an\nimpulse control disorder, and 24% experience a substance use disorder (Kessler, Merikangas,\n& Wang, 2007).\nWomen experience two to three times higher rates of MDD than do men (Nolen-Hoeksema\n& Hilt, 2009). This gender difference emerges during puberty (Conley & Rudolph, 2009). Before\npuberty, boys exhibit similar or higher prevalence rates of MDD than do girls (Twenge & Nolen-\nHoeksema, 2002). MDD is inversely correlated with socioeconomic status (SES), a person\u2019s\neconomic and social position based on income, education, and occupation. Higher prevalence\nrates of MDD are associated with lower SES (Lorant, Deliege, Eaton, Robert, Philippot, &\nAnsseau, 2003), particularly for adults over 65 years old (Kessler et al., 2010). Independent\nof SES, results from a nationally representative sample found that European Americans had\na higher prevalence rate of MDD than did African Americans and Hispanic Americans, whose\nrates were similar (Breslau, Aguilar-Gaxiola, Kendler, Su, Williams, & Kessler, 2006). The course\nof MDD for African Americans is often more severe and less often treated than it is for European\nAmericans, however (Williams et al., 2007). Native Americans have a higher prevalence rate\nthan do European Americans, African Americans, or Hispanic Americans (Hasin, Goodwin,\nStinson & Grant, 2005). Depression is not limited to industrialized or western cultures; it is\nfound in all countries that have\nbeen examined, although the\nsymptom presentation as well as\nprevalence rates vary across\ncultures (Chentsova-Dutton & Tsai,\n2009).\nBipolar Disorders\nThe lifetime prevalence rate of\nbipolar spectrum disorders in the\ngeneral U.S. population is estimated\nat approximately 4.4%, with BD I\nconstituting about 1% of this rate\nAdolescents experience a higher incidence of bipolar spectrum disorders\n(Merikangas et al., 2007). Prevalence\nthan do adults. Making matters worse, those who are diagnosed with BD\nat a younger age seem to suffer symptoms more intensely than those with estimates, however, are highly\nadult onset. dependent on the diagnostic Mood Disorders 406\nprocedures used (e.g., interviews vs. self-report) and whether or not sub-threshold forms of\nthe disorder are included in the estimate. BD often co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders.\nApproximately 65% of people with BD meet diagnostic criteria for at least one additional\npsychiatric disorder, most commonly anxiety disorders and substance use disorders (McElroy\net al., 2001). The co-occurrence of BD with other psychiatric disorders is associated with poorer\nillness course, including higher rates of suicidality (Leverich et al., 2003). A recent cross-national\nstudy sample of more than 60,000 adults from 11 countries, estimated the worldwide\nprevalence of BD at 2.4%, with BD I constituting 0.6% of this rate (Merikangas et al., 2011). In\nthis study, the prevalence of BD varied somewhat by country. Whereas the United States had\nthe highest lifetime prevalence (4.4%), India had the lowest (0.1%). Variation in prevalence\nrates was not necessarily related to SES, as in the case of Japan, a high-income country with\na very low prevalence rate of BD (0.7%).\nWith regard to ethnicity, data from studies not confounded by SES or inaccuracies in diagnosis\nare limited, but available reports suggest rates of BD among European Americans are similar\nto those found among African Americans (Blazer et al., 1985) and Hispanic Americans (Breslau,\nKendler, Su, Gaxiola-Aguilar, & Kessler, 2005). Another large community-based study found\nthat although prevalence rates of mood disorders were similar across ethnic groups, Hispanic\nAmericans and African Americans with a mood disorder were more likely to remain\npersistently ill than European Americans (Breslau et al., 2005). Compared with European\nAmericans with BD, African Americans tend to be underdiagnosed for BD (and over-diagnosed\nfor schizophrenia) (Kilbourne, Haas, Mulsant, Bauer, & Pincus, 2004; Minsky, Vega, Miskimen,\nGara, & Escobar, 2003), and Hispanic Americans with BD have been shown to receive fewer\npsychiatric medication prescriptions and specialty treatment visits (Gonzalez et al., 2007).\nMisdiagnosis of BD can result in the underutilization of treatment or the utilization of\ninappropriate treatment, and thus profoundly impact the course of illness.\nAs with MDD, adolescence is known to be a significant risk period for BD; mood symptoms\nstart by adolescence in roughly half of BD cases (Leverich et al., 2007; Perlis et al., 2004).\nLongitudinal studies show that those diagnosed with BD prior to adulthood experience a more\npernicious course of illness relative to those with adult onset, including more episode\nrecurrence, higher rates of suicidality, and profound social, occupational, and economic\nrepercussions (e.g., Lewinsohn, Seeley, Buckley, & Klein, 2002). The prevalence of BD is\nsubstantially lower in older adults compared with younger adults (1% vs. 4%) (Merikangas et\nal., 2007).\nWhat Are Some of the Factors Implicated in the Development and\nCourse of Mood Disorders? Mood Disorders 407\nMood disorders are complex disorders resulting from multiple factors. Causal explanations\ncan be attempted at various levels, including biological and psychosocial levels. Below are\nseveral of the key factors that contribute to onset and course of mood disorders are\nhighlighted.\nDepressive Disorders\nResearch across family and twin\nstudies has provided support that\ngenetic factors are implicated in the\ndevelopment of MDD. Twin studies\nsuggest that familial influence on\nMDD is mostly due to genetic effects\nand that individual-specific environ\u00ad\nmental effects (e.g., romantic\nrelationships) play an important\nrole, too. By contrast, the contribution\nof shared environmental effect by\nsiblings is negligible (Sullivan, Neale\n& Kendler, 2000). The mode of\nRomantic relationships can affect mood as in the case of divorce or the\ninheritance is not fully understood\ndeath of a spouse. [Photo: johnm2205]\nalthough no single genetic variation\nhas been found to increase the risk of MDD significantly. Instead, several genetic variants and\nenvironmental factors most likely contribute to the risk for MDD (Lohoff, 2010).\nOne environmental stressor that has received much support in relation to MDD is stressful\nlife events. In particular, severe stressful life events\u2014those that have long-term consequences\nand involve loss of a significant relationship (e.g., divorce) or economic stability (e.g.,\nunemployment) are strongly related to depression (Brown & Harris, 1989; Monroe et al., 2009).\nStressful life events are more likely to predict the first MDE than subsequent episodes\n(Lewinsohn, Allen, Seeley, & Gotlib, 1999). In contrast, minor events may play a larger role in\nsubsequent episodes than the initial episodes (Monroe & Harkness, 2005).\nDepression research has not been limited to examining reactivity to stressful life events. Much\nresearch, particularly brain imagining research using functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI), has centered on examining neural circuitry\u2014the interconnections that allow multiple\nbrain regions to perceive, generate, and encode information in concert. A meta-analysis of\nneuroimaging studies showed that when viewing negative stimuli (e.g., picture of an angry Mood Disorders 408\nface, picture of a car accident), compared with healthy control participants, participants with\nMDD have greater activation in brain regions involved in stress response and reduced\nactivation of brain regions involved in positively motivated behaviors (Hamilton, Etkin, Furman,\nLemus, Johnson, & Gotlib, 2012).\nOther environmental factors related to increased risk for MDD include experiencing early\nadversity (e.g., childhood abuse or neglect; Widom, DuMont, & Czaja, 2007), chronic stress\n(e.g., poverty) and interpersonal factors. For example, marital dissatisfaction predicts\nincreases in depressive symptoms in both men and women. On the other hand, depressive\nsymptoms also predict increases in marital dissatisfaction (Whisman & Uebelacker, 2009).\nResearch has found that people with MDD generate some of their interpersonal stress\n(Hammen, 2005). People with MDD whose relatives or spouses can be described as critical\nand emotionally overinvolved have higher relapse rates than do those living with people who\nare less critical and emotionally overinvolved (Butzlaff & Hooley, 1998).\nPeople\u2019s attributional styles or their general ways of thinking, interpreting, and recalling\ninformation have also been examined in the etiology of MDD (Gotlib & Joormann, 2010).\nPeople with a pessimistic attributional style tend to make internal (versus external), global\n(versus specific), and stable (versus unstable) attributions to negative events, serving as a\nvulnerability to developing MDD. For example, someone who when he fails an exam thinks\nthat it was his fault (internal), that he is stupid (global), and that he will always do poorly (stable)\nhas a pessimistic attribution style. Several influential theories of depression incorporate\nattributional styles (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989; Abramson Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978).\nBipolar Disorders\nAlthough there have been important advances in research on the etiology, course, and\ntreatment of BD, there remains a need to understand the mechanisms that contribute to\nepisode onset and relapse. There is compelling evidence for biological causes of BD, which is\nknown to be highly heritable (McGuffin, Rijsdijk, Andrew, Sham, Katz, & Cardno, 2003). It may\nbe argued that a high rate of heritability demonstrates that BD is fundamentally a biological\nphenomenon. However, there is much variability in the course of BD both within a person\nacross time and across people (Johnson, 2005). The triggers that determine how and when\nthis genetic vulnerability is expressed are not yet understood; however, there is evidence to\nsuggest that psychosocial triggers may play an important role in BD risk (e.g., Johnson et al.,\n2008; Malkoff-Schwartz et al., 1998).\nIn addition to the genetic contribution, biological explanations of BD have also focused on Mood Disorders 409\nbrain function. Many of the studies using fMRI techniques to characterize BD have focused\non the processing of emotional stimuli based on the idea that BD is fundamentally a disorder\nof emotion (APA, 2000). Findings show that regions of the brain thought to be involved in\nemotional processing and regulation are activated differently in people with BD relative to\nhealthy controls (e.g., Altshuler et al., 2008; Hassel et al., 2008; Lennox, Jacob, Calder, Lupson,\n& Bullmore, 2004).\nHowever, there is little consensus as to whether a particular brain region becomes more or\nless active in response to an emotional stimulus among people with BD compared with healthy\ncontrols. Mixed findings are in part due to samples consisting of participants who are at various\nphases of illness at the time of testing (manic, depressed, inter-episode). Sample sizes tend\nto be relatively small, making comparisons between subgroups difficult. Additionally, the use\nof a standardized stimulus (e.g., facial expression of anger) may not elicit a sufficiently strong\nresponse. Personally engaging stimuli, such as recalling a memory, may be more effective in\ninducing strong emotions (Isacowitz, Gershon, Allard, & Johnson, 2013).\nWithin the psychosocial level, research has focused on the environmental contributors to BD.\nA series of studies show that environmental stressors, particularly severe stressors (e.g., loss\nof a significant relationship), can adversely impact the course of BD. People with BD have\nsubstantially increased risk of relapse (Ellicott, Hammen, Gitlin, Brown, & Jamison, 1990) and\nsuffer more depressive symptoms (Johnson, Winett, Meyer, Greenhouse, & Miller, 1999)\nfollowing a severe life stressor. Interestingly, positive life events can also adversely impact the\ncourse of BD. People with BD suffer more manic symptoms after life events involving\nattainment of a desired goal (Johnson et al., 2008). Such findings suggest that people with BD\nmay have a hypersensitivity to rewards.\nEvidence from the life stress literature has also suggested that people with mood disorders\nmay have a circadian vulnerability that renders them sensitive to stressors that disrupt their\nsleep or rhythms. According to social zeitgeber theory (Ehlers, Frank, & Kupfer, 1988; Frank\net al., 1994), stressors that disrupt sleep, or that disrupt the daily routines that entrain the\nbiological clock (e.g., meal times) can trigger episode relapse. Consistent with this theory,\nstudies have shown that life events that involve a disruption in sleep and daily routines, such\nas overnight travel, can increase bipolar symptoms in people with BD (Malkoff-Schwartz et\nal., 1998).\nWhat Are Some of the Well-Supported Treatments for Mood\nDisorders? Mood Disorders 410\nDepressive Disorders\nThere are many treatment options\navailable for people with MDD. First,\na number of antidepressant medications\nare available, all of which target one\nor more of the neurotransmitters\nimplicated in depression.The earliest\nantidepressant medications were\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).\nMAOIs inhibit monoamine oxidase,\nan enzyme involved in deactivating\ndopamine, norepinephrine, and\nserotonin. Although effective in\nA number of medications are effective in treating mood disorders.\ntreating depression, MAOIs can have\nMeditation, exercise, counseling and other therapies also show\nserious side effects. Patients taking\neffectiveness for some disorders. [Photo: TheRogue]\nMAOIs may develop dangerously\nhigh blood pressure if they take certain drugs (e.g., antihistamines) or eat foods containing\ntyramine, an amino acid commonly found in foods such as aged cheeses, wine, and soy sauce.\nTricyclics, the second-oldest class of antidepressant medications, block the reabsorption of\nnorepinephrine, serotonin, or dopamine at synapses, resulting in their increased availability.\nTricyclics are most effective for treating vegetative and somatic symptoms of depression. Like\nMAOIs, they have serious side effects, the most concerning of which is being cardiotoxic.\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g., Fluoxetine) and serotonin and\nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; e.g., Duloxetine) are the most recently introduced\nantidepressant medications. SSRIs, the most commonly prescribed antidepressant\nmedication, block the reabsorption of serotonin, whereas SNRIs block the reabsorption of\nserotonin and norepinephrine. SSRIs and SNRIs have fewer serious side effects than do MAOIs\nand tricyclics. In particular, they are less cardiotoxic, less lethal in overdose, and produce fewer\ncognitive impairments. They are not, however, without their own side effects, which include\nbut are not limited to difficulty having orgasms, gastrointestinal issues, and insomnia.\nOther biological treatments for people with depression include electroconvulsive therapy\n(ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and deep brain stimulation. ECT involves\ninducing a seizure after a patient takes muscle relaxants and is under general anesthesia. ECT\nis viable treatment for patients with severe depression or who show resistance to\nantidepressants although the mechanisms through which it works remain unknown. A\ncommon side effect is confusion and memory loss, usually short-term (Schulze- Mood Disorders 411\nRauschenbach, Harms, Schlaepfer, Maier, Falkai, & Wagner, 2005). Repetitive TMS is a\nnoninvasive technique administered while a patient is awake. Brief pulsating magnetic fields\nare delivered to the cortex, inducing electrical activity. TMS has fewer side effects than ECT\n(Schulze-Rauschenbach et al., 2005), and while outcome studies are mixed, there is evidence\nthat TMS is a promising treatment for patients with MDD who have shown resistance to other\ntreatments (Rosa et al., 2006). Most recently, deep brain stimulation is being examined as a\ntreatment option for patients who did not respond to more traditional treatments like those\nalready described. Deep brain stimulation involves implanting an electrode in the brain. The\nelectrode is connected to an implanted neurostimulator, which electrically stimulates that\nparticular brain region. Although there is some evidence of its effectiveness (Mayberg et al.,\n2005), additional research is needed.\nSeveral psychosocial treatments have received strong empirical support, meaning that\nindependent investigations have achieved similarly positive results\u2014a high threshold for\nexamining treatment outcomes. These treatments include but are not limited to behavior\ntherapy, cognitive therapy, and interpersonal therapy. Behavior therapies focus on increasing\nthe frequency and quality of experiences that are pleasant or help the patient achieve mastery.\nCognitive therapies primarily focus on helping patients identify and change distorted\nautomatic thoughts and assumptions (e.g., Beck, 1967). Cognitive-behavioral therapies are\nbased on the rationale that thoughts, behaviors, and emotions affect and are affected by each\nother. Interpersonal Therapy for Depression focuses largely on improving interpersonal\nrelationships by targeting problem areas, specifically unresolved grief, interpersonal role\ndisputes, role transitions, and interpersonal deficits. Finally, there is also some support for\nthe effectiveness of Short-Term Psychodynamic Therapy for Depression (Leichsenring, 2001).\nThe short-term treatment focuses on a limited number of important issues, and the therapist\ntends to be more actively involved than in more traditional psychodynamic therapy.\nBipolar Disorders\nPatients with BD are typically treated with pharmacotherapy. Antidepressants such as SSRIs\nand SNRIs are the primary choice of treatment for depression, whereas for BD, lithium is the\nfirst line treatment choice. This is because SSRIs and SNRIs have the potential to induce mania\nor hypomania in patients with BD. Lithium acts on several neurotransmitter systems in the\nbrain through complex mechanisms, including reduction of excitatory (dopamine and\nglutamate) neurotransmission, and increasing of inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmission (Lenox\n& Hahn, 2000). Lithium has strong efficacy for the treatment of BD (Geddes, Burgess, Hawton,\nJamison, & Goodwin, 2004). However, a number of side effects can make lithium treatment\ndifficult for patients to tolerate. Side effects include impaired cognitive function (Wingo, Wingo, Mood Disorders 412\nHarvey, & Baldessarini, 2009), as well as physical symptoms such as nausea, tremor, weight\ngain, and fatigue (Dunner, 2000). Some of these side effects can improve with continued use;\nhowever, medication noncompliance remains an ongoing concern in the treatment of patients\nwith BD. Anticonvulsant medications (e.g., carbamazepine, valproate) are also commonly used\nto treat patients with BD, either alone or in conjunction with lithium.\nThere are several adjunctive treatment options for people with BD. Interpersonal and social\nrhythm therapy (IPSRT; Frank et al., 1994) is a psychosocial intervention focused on addressing\nthe mechanism of action posited in social zeitgeber theory to predispose patients who have\nBD to relapse, namely sleep disruption. A growing body of literature provides support for the\ncentral role of sleep dysregulation in BD (Harvey, 2008). Consistent with this literature, IPSRT\naims to increase rhythmicity of patients\u2019 lives and encourage vigilance in maintaining a stable\nrhythm. The therapist and patient work to develop and maintain a healthy balance of activity\nand stimulation such that the patient does not become overly active (e.g., by taking on too\nmany projects) or inactive (e.g., by avoiding social contact). The efficacy of IPSRT has been\ndemonstrated in that patients who received this treatment show reduced risk of episode\nrecurrence and are more likely to remain well (Frank et al., 2005).\nConclusion\nEveryone feels down or euphoric from time to time. For some people, these feelings can last\nfor long periods of time and can also co-occur with other symptoms that, in combination,\ninterfere with their everyday lives. When people experience an MDE or a manic episode, they\nsee the world differently. During an MDE, people often feel hopeless about the future, and\nmay even experience suicidal thoughts. During a manic episode, people often behave in ways\nthat are risky or place them in danger. They may spend money excessively or have unprotected\nsex, often expressing deep shame over these decisions after the episode. MDD and BD cause\nsignificant problems for people at school, at work, and in their relationships and affect people\nregardless of gender, age, nationality, race, religion, or sexual orientation. If you or someone\nyou know is suffering from a mood disorder, it is important to seek help. Effective treatments\nare available and continually improving. If you have an interest in mood disorders, there are\nmany ways to contribute to their understanding, prevention, and treatment, whether by\nengaging in research or clinical work.

What factors might explain the large gender difference in the prevalence rates of MDD?\n2. Why might American ethnic minority groups experience more persistent BD than European\nAmericans?\n3. Why might the age of onset for MDD be decreasing over time?\n4. Why might overnight travel constitute a potential risk for a person with BD?\n5. What are some reasons positive life events may precede the occurrence of manic episode?

Perhaps it was while you were driving or\nattending class. Some portion of your attention was on the activity at hand, but most of your\nconscious mind was wrapped up in fantasy. Now imagine that you could not control your\ndaydreams. What if they intruded your waking consciousness unannounced, causing you to\nlose track of reality or experience the loss of time. Imagine how difficult it would be for you.\nThis is similar to what people who suffer from dissociative disorders may experience. Of the Dissociative Disorders 423\nmany disorders listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2013), dissociative disorders rank as among the most\npuzzling and controversial. Dissociative disorders encompass an array of symptoms ranging\nfrom memory loss (amnesia) for autobiographical events, to changes in identity and the\nexperience of everyday reality (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).\nIs it real?\nLet\u2019s start with a little\nhistory. Multiple personality\ndisorder, or dissociative\nidentity disorder\u2014as it is\nknown now\u2014used to be a\nmere curiosity. This is a\ndisorder in which people\npresent with more than one\npersonality. For example, at\ntimes they might act and\nidentify as an adult while at\nother times they might\nidentify and behave like a\nchild. The disorder was\nDissociative disorders are often exaggerated when portrayed in television and\nmovies; however, there is concrete evidence that people do suffer from these rarely diagnosed until the\ndisorders. [Image: Camilo Rueda L\u00f3pez] 1980s. That\u2019s when multiple\npersonality disorder became\nan official diagnosis in the DSM-III. From then on, the numbers of \u201cmultiples\u201d increased rapidly.\nIn the 1990s, there were hundreds of people diagnosed with multiple personality in every\nmajor city in the United States (Hacking, 1995). How could this \u201cepidemic\u201d be explained?\nOne possible explanation might be the media attention that was given to the disorder. It all\nstarted with the book The Three Faces of Eve (Thigpen & Cleckley, 1957). This book, and later\nthe movie, was one of the first to speak of multiple personality disorder. However, it wasn\u2019t\nuntil years later, when the fictional \u201cas told to\u201d book of Sybil (Schreiber, 1973) became known\nworldwide, that the prototype of what it was like to be a \u201cmultiple personality\u201d was born. Sybil\ntells the story of how a clinician\u2014Cornelia Wilbur\u2014unravels the different personalities of her\npatient Sybil during a long course of treatment (over 2,500 office hours!). She was one of the\nfirst to relate multiple personality to childhood sexual abuse. Probably, this relation between\nchildhood abuse and dissociation has fueled the increase of numbers of multiples from that Dissociative Disorders 424\ntime on. It motivated therapists to actively seek for clues of childhood abuse in their\ndissociative patients. This suited well within the mindset of the 1980s, as childhood abuse\nwas a sensitive issue then in psychology as well as in politics (Hacking, 1995).\nFrom then on, many movies and books were made on the subject of multiple personality, and\nnowadays, we see patients with dissociative identity disorder as guests visiting the Oprah\nWinfrey show, as if they were our modern-day circus acts.\nDefining dissociation\nThe DSM-5 defines dissociation as \u201ca disruption and/or discontinuity in the normal integration\nof consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control\nand behavior\u201d (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, p. 291). A distinction is often made\nbetween dissociative states and dissociative traits (e.g., Bremner, 2010; Bremner & Brett, 1997).\nState dissociation is viewed as a transient symptom, which lasts for a few minutes or hours\n(e.g., dissociation during a traumatic event). Trait dissociation is viewed as an integral aspect\nof personality. Dissociative symptoms occur in patients but also in the general population,\nlike you and me. Therefore, dissociation has commonly been conceptualized as ranging on a\ncontinuum, from nonsevere manifestations of daydreaming to more severe disturbances\ntypical of dissociative disorders (Bernstein & Putnam, 1986). The dissociative disorders\ninclude:\n1. Dissociative Amnesia (extensive forgetting typically associated with highly aversive events);\n2. Dissociative Fugue (short-lived reversible amnesia for personal identity, involving\nunplanned travel or \u201cbewildered wandering.\u201d Dissociative fugue is not viewed as a separate\ndisorder but is a feature of some, but not all, cases of dissociative amnesia );\n3. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (feeling as though one is an outside observer of\none\u2019s body); and\n4. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID; experiencing two or more distinct identities that\nrecurrently take control over one\u2019s behavior) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).\nAlthough the concept of dissociation lacks a generally accepted definition, the Structural\nClinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D) (Steinberg, 2001) assesses five\nsymptom clusters that encompass key features of the dissociative disorders. These clusters\nare also found in the DSM-5:\n1. depersonalization, Dissociative Disorders 425\n2. derealization,\n3. dissociative amnesia,\n4. identity confusion, and\n5. identity alteration.\nDepersonalization refers to a\n\u201cfeeling of detachment or\nestrangement from one\u2019s\nself.\u201d Imagine that you are\noutside of your own body,\nlooking at yourself from a\ndistance as though you were\nlooking at somebody else.\nMaybe you can also imagine\nwhat it would be like if you\nfelt like a robot, deprived of\nall feelings. These are examples\nof depersonalization. Derea\u00ad\nlization is defined as \u201can\nHave you ever said a word so many times that it no longer seemed \u201creal\u201d to you?\nalteration in the perception\nDerealization is a similar experience, but one that applies to all of reality. [Image:\nof one\u2019s surroundings so that\nmadamepsychosis]\na sense of reality of the\nexternal world is lost\u201d (Steinberg, 2001, p. 101). Imagine that the world around you seems as\nif you are living in a movie, or looking through a fog. These are examples of derealization.\nDissociative amnesia does not refer to permanent memory loss, similar to the erasure of a\ncomputer disk, but rather to the hypothetical disconnection of memories from conscious\ninspection (Steinberg, 2001). Thus, the memory is still there somewhere, but you cannot reach\nit. Identity confusion is defined by Steinberg as \u201c\u2026 thoughts and feelings of uncertainty and\nconflict a person has related to his or her identity\u201d (Steinberg, 2001, p. 101), whereas identity\nalteration describes the behavioral acting out of this uncertainty and conflict (Bernstein &\nPutnam, 1986).\nDissociative disorders are not as uncommon as you would expect. Several studies in a variety\nof patient groups show that dissociative disorders are prevalent in a 4%\u201329% range (Ross,\nAnderson, Fleischer, & Norton, 1991; Sar, Tutkun, Alyanak, Bakim, & Baral, 2000; Tutkun et al.,\n1998. For reviews see: Foote, Smolin, Kaplan, Legatt, & Lipschitz, 2006; Spiegel et al., 2011).\nStudies generally find a much lower prevalence in the general population, with rates in the\norder of 1%\u20133% (Lee, Kwok, Hunter, Richards, & David, 2010; Rauschenberger & Lynn, 1995; Dissociative Disorders 426\nSandberg & Lynn, 1992). Importantly, dissociative symptoms are not limited to the dissociative\ndisorders. Certain diagnostic groups, notably patients with borderline personality disorder,\nposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (Rufer, Fricke, Held,\nCremer, & Hand, 2006), and schizophrenia (Allen & Coyne, 1995; Merckelbach, \u00e0 Campo, Hardy,\n& Giesbrecht, 2005; Yu et al., 2010) also display heightened levels of dissociation.\nMeasuring dissociation\nThe Dissociative Experiences Scale(DES) (Bernstein & Putnam, 1986; Carlson & Putnam, 2000;\nWright & Loftus, 1999) is the most widely used self-report measure of dissociation. A self-\nreport measure is a type of psychological test in which a person completes a survey or\nquestionnaire with or without the help of an investigator. This scale measures dissociation\nwith items such as (a) \u201cSome people sometimes have the experience of feeling as though they\nare standing next to themselves or watching themselves do something, and they actually see\nthemselves as if they were looking at another person\u201d and (b) \u201cSome people find that\nsometimes they are listening to someone talk, and they suddenly realize that they did not\nhear part or all of what was said.\u201d\nThe DES is suitable only as a screening tool. When somebody scores a high level of dissociation\non this scale, this does not necessarily mean that he or she is suffering from a dissociative\ndisorder. It does, however, give an indication to investigate the symptoms more extensively.\nThis is usually done with a structured clinical interview, called the Structured Clinical Interview\nfor DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (Steinberg, 1994), which is performed by an experienced\nclinician. With the publication of the new DSM-5 there has been an updated version of this\ninstrument.\nDissociation and Trauma\nThe most widely held perspective on dissociative symptoms is that they reflect a defensive\nresponse to highly aversive events, mostly trauma experiences during the childhood years\n(Bremner, 2010; Spiegel et al., 2011; Spitzer, Vogel, Barnow, Freyberger, & Grabe, 2007).\nOne prominent interpretation of the origins of dissociative disorders is that they are the direct\nresult of exposure to traumatic experiences. We will refer to this interpretation as the\nposttraumatic model (PTM). According to the PTM, dissociative symptoms can best be\nunderstood as mental strategies to cope with or avoid the impact of highly aversive\nexperiences (e.g., Spiegel et al., 2011). In this view, individuals rely on dissociation to escape\nfrom painful memories (Gershuny & Thayer, 1999). Once they have learned to use this Dissociative Disorders 427\ndefensive coping mechanism, it can become automatized and habitual, even emerging in\nresponse to minor stressors\n(Van der Hart & Horst, 1989).\nThe idea that dissociation can\nserve a defensive function can\nbe traced back to Pierre Janet\n(1899/1973), one of the first\nscholars to link dissociation to\npsychological trauma (Hacking,\n1995).\nThe PTM casts the clinical\nAll of us have played games at times to \u201cescape reality.\u201d But for some people with\nobservation that dissociative\ntruly traumatic experiences, that reality they escape to can become the reality\ndisorders are linked to a\nthey live in. [Image: Janine]\ntrauma history in straightforward\ncausal terms, that is, one causes the other (Gershuny & Thayer, 1999). For example, Vermetten\nand colleagues (Vermetten, Schmahl, Lindner, Loewenstein, & Bremner, 2006) found that the\nDID patients in their study all suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder and concluded that\nDID should be conceptualized as an extreme form of early-abuse\u2013related posttraumatic stress\ndisorder (Vermetten et al., 2006).\nCausality and evidence\nThe empirical evidence that trauma leadsto dissociative symptoms is the subject of intense\ndebate (Kihlstrom, 2005; Bremner, 2010; Giesbrecht, Lynn, Lilienfeld & Merckelbach, 2010).\nThree limitations of the PTM will be described below.\nFirst, the majority of studies reporting links between self-reported trauma and dissociation\nare based on cross-sectional designs. This means that the data are collected at one point in\ntime. When analyzing this type of data, one can only state whether scoring high on a particular\nquestionnaire (for example, a trauma questionnaire) is indicative of also scoring high on\nanother questionnaire (for example, the DES). This makes it difficult to state if one thing led\nto another, and therefore if the relation between the two is causal. Thus, the data that these\ndesigns yield do not allow for strong causal claims (Merckelbach & Muris, 2002).\nSecond, whether somebody has experienced a trauma is often established using a\nquestionnaire that the person completes himself or herself. This is called a self-report\nmeasure. Herein lies the problem. Individuals suffering from dissociative symptoms typically Dissociative Disorders 428\nhave high fantasy proneness. This is a character trait to engage in extensive and vivid\nfantasizing. The tendency to fantasize a lot may increase the risk of exaggerating or\nunderstating self-reports of traumatic experiences (Merckelbach et al., 2005; Giesbrecht, Lynn,\nLilienfeld, & Merckelbach, 2008).\nThird, high dissociative individuals report more cognitive failures than low dissociative\nindividuals. Cognitive failures are everyday slips and lapses, such as failing to notice signposts\non the road, forgetting appointments, or bumping into people. This can be seen, in part, in\nthe DSM-5 criteria for DID, in which people may have difficulty recalling everyday events as\nwell as those that are traumatic. People who frequently make such slips and lapses often\nmistrust their own cognitive capacities. They also tend to overvalue the hints and cues provided\nby others (Merckelbach, Horselenberg, & Schmidt, 2002; Merckelbach, Muris, Rassin, &\nHorselenberg, 2000). This makes them vulnerable to suggestive information, which may\ndistort self-reports, and thus limits conclusions that can be drawn from studies that rely solely\non self-reports to investigate the trauma-dissociation link (Merckelbach & Jelicic, 2004).\nMost important, however, is that the PTM does not tell us how trauma produces dissociative\nsymptoms. Therefore, workers in the field have searched for other explanations. They\nproposed that due to their dreamlike character, dissociative symptoms such as derealization,\ndepersonalization, and absorption are associated with sleep-related experiences. They further\nnoted that sleep-related experiences can explain the relation between highly aversive events\nand dissociative symptoms (Giesbrecht et al., 2008; Watson, 2001). In the following paragraph,\nthe relation between dissociation and sleep will be discussed.\nDissociation and Sleep\nA little history\nResearchers (Watson, 2001) have\nproposed that dissociative symptoms,\nsuch as absorption, derealization,\nand depersonalization originate\nfrom sleep. This idea is not entirely\nnew. In the 19th century, double\nThose who have fallen asleep in class have likely experienced those \u201cmicro-\nconsciousness (or d\u00e9doublement),\ndreams\u201d - that moment or two where reality kind of blends in with your\nthe historical precursor of dissociative\ndreams. For a long time, scientists thought dissociative disorders were\nsimply this confusion of waking and dreaming states. identity disorder (DID; formerly\n[Image: Mislav Marohni\u0107] known as multiple personality Dissociative Disorders 429\ndisorder), was often described as \u201csomnambulism,\u201d which refers to a state of sleepwalking.\nPatients suffering from this disorder were referred to as \u201csomnambules\u201d (Hacking, 1995).\nMany 19th-century scholars believed that these patients were switching between a \u201cnormal\nstate\u201d and a \u201csomnambulistic state.\u201d Hughlings Jackson, a well-known English neurologist from\nthis era, viewed dissociation as the uncoupling of normal consciousness, which would result\nin what he termed \u201cthe dreamy state\u201d (Meares, 1999). Interestingly, a century later, Levitan\n(1967) hypothesized that \u201cdepersonalization is a compromise state between dreaming and\nwaking\u201d (p.157). Arlow (1966) observed that the dissociation between the \u201cexperiencing self\u201d\nand the \u201cobserving self\u201d serves as the basis of depersonalized states, emphasizing its\noccurrence, especially in dreams. Likewise, Franklin (1990) considered dreamlike thoughts,\nthe amnesia one usually has for dreams, and the lack of orientation of time, place, and person\nduring dreams to be strikingly similar to the amnesia DID patients often report for their\ntraumas. Related, Barrett (1994, 1995) described the similarity between dream characters and\n\u201calter personalities\u201d in DID, with respect to cognitive and sensory abilities, movement, amnesia,\nand continuity with normal waking. The many similarities between dreaming states and\ndissociative symptoms are also a recurrent theme in the more recent clinical literature (e.g.,\nBob, 2004).\nSleep problems in patients with dissociative disorders\nAnecdotal evidence supports the idea that sleep disruptions are linked to dissociation. For\nexample, in patients with depersonalization, symptoms are worst when they are tired (Simeon\n& Abugel, 2006). Interestingly, among participants who report memories of childhood sexual\nabuse, experiences of sleep paralysis typically are accompanied by raised levels of dissociative\nsymptoms (McNally & Clancy, 2005; Abrams, Mulligan, Carleton, & Asmundson, 2008).\nPatients with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and borderline personality\ndisorder\u2014conditions with relatively high levels of dissociative symptoms\u2014as a rule exhibit\nsleep abnormalities. Recent research points to fairly specific relationships between certain\nsleep complaints (e.g., insomnia, nightmares) and certain forms of psychopathology (e.g.,\ndepression, posttraumatic stress disorder) (Koffel & Watson, 2009).\nStudying the relationship between dissociation and sleep\nIn the general population, both dissociative symptoms and sleep problems are highly\nprevalent. For example, 29 percent of American adults report sleep problems (National Sleep\nFoundation, 2005). This allows researchers to study the relationship between dissociation and\nsleep not only in patients but also in the general population. In a pioneering study, Watson Dissociative Disorders 430\n(2001) showed that dissociative symptoms\u2014measured by the DES\u2014are linked to self-reports\nof vivid dreams, nightmares, recurrent dreams, and other unusual sleep phenomena. This\nrelationship has been studied extensively ever since, leading to three important statements.\nFirst, Watson\u2019s (2001) basic findings have been reproduced time and again. This means that\nthe same results (namely that dissociation and sleep problems are related) have been found\nin lots of different studies, using different groups, and different materials. All lead to the\nconclusion that unusual sleep experiences and dissociative symptoms are linked.\nSecond, the connection between sleep and dissociation is specific. It seems that unusual sleep\nphenomena that are difficult to control, including nightmares and waking dreams, are related\nto dissociative symptoms, but lucid dreaming\u2014dreams that are controllable\u2014are only weakly\nrelated to dissociative symptoms. For example, dream recall frequency was related to\ndissociation (Suszek & Kopera, 2005). Individuals who reported three or more nightmares\nover a three-week period showed higher levels of dissociation compared to individuals\nreporting two nightmares or less (Levin & Fireman, 2002), and a relation was found between\ndream intensity and dissociation (Yu et al., 2010).\nThird, the sleep-dissociation link is apparent not only in general population groups\u2014people\nsuch as you and me\u2014but also in patient groups. Accordingly, one group of researchers\nreported nightmare disorder in 17 out of 30 DID patients (Agargun et al., 2003). They also\nfound a 27.5% prevalence of nocturnal dissociative episodes in patients with dissociative\ndisorders (Agargun et al., 2001). Another study investigated a group of borderline personality\ndisorder patients and found that 49% of them suffered from nightmare disorder. Moreover,\nthe patients with nightmare disorder displayed higher levels of dissociation than patients not\nsuffering from nightmare disorder (Semiz, Basoglu, Ebrinc, & Cetin, 2008). Additionally, Ross\n(2011) found that patients suffering from DID reported higher rates of sleepwalking compared\nto a group of psychiatric outpatients and a sample from the general population.\nTo sum up, there seems to be a strong relationship between dissociative symptoms and\nunusual sleep experiences that is evident in a range of phenomena, including waking dreams,\nnightmares, and sleepwalking.\nInducing and reducing sleep problems\nSleep problems can be induced in healthy participants by keeping them awake for a long\nduration of time. This is called sleep deprivation. If dissociative symptoms are fueled by a\nlabile sleep-wake cycle, then sleep loss would be expected to intensify dissociative symptoms. Dissociative Disorders 431\nSome evidence that this might work was already found in 2001, when soldiers who underwent\na U.S. Army survival training, which included sleep deprivation, showed increases in\ndissociative symptoms (Morgan et al., 2001). Other researchers conducted a study that tracked\n25 healthy volunteers during one day and one night of sleep loss. They found that dissociative\nsymptoms increased substantially after one night of sleep loss (Giesbrecht, Smeets, Leppink,\nJelicic, & Merckelbach, 2007).\nTo further examine the causal link between dissociative experiences and sleep, we (van der\nKloet, Giesbrecht, Lynn, Merckelbach, & de Zutter, 2011) investigated the relationship between\nunusual sleep experiences and dissociation in a patient group at a private clinic. They\ncompleted questionnaires upon arrival at the clinic and again when they departed eight weeks\nlater. During their stay, they followed a strict program designed to improve sleep problems.\nAnd it worked! In most patients, sleep quality was improved after eight weeks. We found a\nrobust link between sleep experiences and dissociative symptoms and determined that sleep\nnormalization was accompanied by a reduction in dissociative symptoms.\nAn exciting interpretation of the link between dissociative symptoms and unusual sleep\nphenomena (see also, Watson, 2001) may be this: A disturbed sleep\u2013wake cycle may lead to\ndissociative symptoms. However, we should be cautious. Although studies support a causal\narrow leading from sleep disruption to dissociative symptoms, the associations between sleep\nand dissociation may be more complex. For example, causal links may be bi-directional, such\nthat dissociative symptoms may lead to sleep problems and vice versa, and other\npsychopathology may interfere in the link between sleep and dissociative symptoms (van der\nKloet et al., 2011).\nImplications and Conclusions\nThe sleep-dissociation model\noffers a fresh and exciting\nperspective on dissociative\nsymptoms. This model may\nseem remote from the PTM.\nHowever, both models can\nbe integrated in a single\nconceptual scheme in which\ntraumatic childhood experiences\nNo longer are dissociative disorders an untreatable illness. With the new methods\ndeveloped by researchers, there is hope for curing (or at least improving) those with may lead to disturbed sleep\nthis debilitating disorder. [Image: Heidi & Matt] patterns, which may be the Dissociative Disorders 432\nfinal common pathway to dissociative symptoms. Accordingly, the sleep-dissociation model\nmay explain both: (a) how traumatic experiences disrupt the sleep\u2013wake cycle and increase\nvulnerability to dissociative symptoms, and (b) why dissociation, trauma, fantasy proneness,\nand cognitive failures overlap.\nFuture studies can also discern what characteristic sleep disruptions in the sleep\u2013wake cycle\nare most reliably related to dissociative disorders, and then establish training programs,\nincluding medication regimens, to address these problems. This would constitute an entirely\nnovel and exciting approach to the treatment of dissociative symptoms.\nIn closing, the sleep-dissociation model can serve as a framework for studies that address a\nwide range of fascinating questions about dissociative symptoms and disorders. We now have\ngood reason to be confident that research on sleep and dissociative symptoms will inform\npsychiatry, clinical science, and psychotherapeutic practice in meaningful ways in the years\nto come.

The sufferer therefore experiences significant memory impairment for\nimportant information not explained by ordinary forgetfulness.\nDissociation\nA disruption in the usually integrated function of consciousness, memory, identity, or\nperception of the environment.\nFantasy proneness\nThe tendency to extensive fantasizing or daydreaming.\nGeneral population\nA sample of people representative of the average individual in our society.\nInsomnia\nA sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep as long as desired.\nSymptoms also include waking up too early, experience many awakenings during the night,\nand not feeling rested during the day.\nLucid dreams\nAny dream in which one is aware that one is dreaming.\nMood disorder\nA group of diagnoses in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-\nTR) classification system where a disturbance in the person\u2019s mood is the primary dysfunction.\nMood disorders include major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, dysthymic and\ncyclothymic disorder.\nNightmares\nAn unpleasant dream that can cause a strong negative emotional response from the mind,\ntypically fear or horror, but also despair, anxiety, and great sadness. The dream may contain\nsituations of danger, discomfort, psychological or physical terror. Sufferers usually awaken\nin a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a prolonged period of time.\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\nThis anxiety disorder is characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions), by repetitive Dissociative Disorders 437\nbehaviors (compulsions), or both. Obsessions produce uneasiness, fear, or worry.\nCompulsions are then aimed at reducing the associated anxiety. Examples of compulsive\nbehaviors include excessive washing or cleaning; repeated checking; extreme hoarding; and\nnervous rituals, such as switching the light on and off a certain number of times when entering\na room. Intrusive thoughts are often sexual, violent, or religious in nature...\nPrevalence\nThe number of cases of a specific disorder present in a given population at a certain time.\nPTM\nPost-traumatic model of dissociation.\nRecurrent dreams\nThe same dream narrative or dreamscape is experienced over different occasions of sleep.\nSchizophrenia\nThis mental disorder is characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and emotional\nresponses. Symptoms include auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or\ndisorganized speech and thinking. Sufferers from this disorder experience grave dysfunctions\nin their social functioning and in work.\nSCID-D\nStructural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders.\nS\u200belf-report measure\nA type of psychological test in which a person fills out a survey or questionnaire with or without\nthe help of an investigator.\nSleep deprivation\nA sufficient lack of restorative sleep over a cumulative period so as to cause physical or\npsychiatric symptoms and affect routine performances of tasks.\nSleep paralysis\nSleep paralysis occurs when the normal paralysis during REM sleep manifests when falling\nasleep or awakening, often accompanied by hallucinations of danger or a malevolent presence\nin the room.\nSleep-wake cycle\nA daily rhythmic activity cycle, based on 24-hour intervals, that is exhibited by many organisms. Dissociative Disorders 438\nState\nWhen a symptom is acute, or transient, lasting from a few minutes to a few hours.\nTrait\nWhen a symptom forms part of the personality or character.\nTrauma\nAn event or situation that causes great distress and disruption, and that creates substantial,\nlasting damage to the psychological development of a person.\nVivid dreams\nA dream that is very clear, where the individual can remember the dream in great detail.

Barch\nSchizophrenia and the other psychotic disorders are some of the most impairing forms of\npsychopathology, frequently associated with a profound negative effect on the individual\u2019s\neducational, occupational, and social function. Sadly, these disorders often manifest right at\ntime of the transition from adolescence to adulthood, just as young people should be evolving\ninto independent young adults. The spectrum of psychotic disorders includes schizophrenia,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, schizophreniform\ndisorder, brief psychotic disorder, as well as psychosis associated with substance use or\nmedical conditions. In this module, we summarize the primary clinical features of these\ndisorders, describe the known cognitive and neurobiological changes associated with\nschizophrenia, describe potential risk factors and/or causes for the development of\nschizophrenia, and describe currently available treatments for schizophrenia.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Describe the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.\n\u2022 Describe the most well-replicated cognitive and neurobiological changes associated with\nschizophrenia.\n\u2022 Describe the potential risk factors for the development of schizophrenia.\n\u2022 Describe the controversies associated with \u201cclinical high risk\u201d approaches to identifying\nindividuals at risk for the development of schizophrenia.\n\u2022 Describe the treatments that work for some of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders 444\nThe phenomenology of schizophrenia and related psychotic\ndisorders\nMost of you have probably had\nthe experience of walking down\nthe street in a city and seeing a\nperson you thought was acting\noddly. They may have been\ndressed in an unusual way,\nperhaps disheveled or wearing\nan unusual collection of clothes,\nmakeup, or jewelry that did not\nseem to fit any particular group\nor subculture. They may have\nbeen talking to themselves or\nyelling at someone you could not\nsee. If you tried to speak to them,\nSchizophrenia is sometimes viewed as a \"splitting of the self\" in which a person they may have been difficult to\nmay have false beliefs about reality. [Photo: Johnny Grim] follow or understand, or they\nmay have acted paranoid or\nstarted telling a bizarre story about the people who were plotting against them. If so, chances\nare that you have encountered an individual with schizophrenia or another type of psychotic\ndisorder. If you have watched the movie A Beautiful Mind or The Fisher King, you have also seen\na portrayal of someone thought to have schizophrenia. Sadly, a few of the individuals who\nhave committed some of the recently highly publicized mass murders may have had\nschizophrenia, though most people who commit such crimes do not have schizophrenia. It is\nalso likely that you have met people with schizophrenia without ever knowing it, as they may\nsuffer in silence or stay isolated to protect themselves from the horrors they see, hear, or\nbelieve are operating in the outside world. As these examples begin to illustrate, psychotic\ndisorders involve many different types of symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations,\ndisorganized speech and behavior, abnormal motor behavior (including catatonia), and\nnegative symptoms such anhedonia/amotivation and blunted affect/reduced speech.\nDelusions are false beliefs that are often fixed, hard to change even when the person is\npresented with conflicting information, and are often culturally influenced in their content (e.\ng., delusions involving Jesus in Judeo-Christian cultures, delusions involving Allah in Muslim\ncultures). They can be terrifying for the person, who may remain convinced that they are true\neven when loved ones and friends present them with clear information that they cannot be Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders 445\ntrue. There are many different types or themes to delusions.\nThe most common delusions\nare persecutory and involve the\nbelief that individuals or groups\nare trying to hurt, harm, or plot\nagainst the person in some way.\nThese can be people that the\nperson knows (people at work,\nthe neighbors, family members),\nor more abstract groups (the\nFBI, the CIA, aliens, etc.). Other\ntypes of delusions include\ngrandiose delusions, where the\nperson believes that they have\nUnder Surveillance: Abstract groups like the police or the government are\nsome special power or ability (e.\ncommonly the focus of a schizophrenic's persecutory delusions. [Photo: Tim\ng., I am the new Buddha, I am a\nShields BC]\nrock star); referential delusions,\nwhere the person believes that events or objects in the environment have special meaning\nfor them (e.g., that song on the radio is being played specifically for me); or other types of\ndelusions where the person may believe that others are controlling their thoughts and actions,\ntheir thoughts are being broadcast aloud, or that others can read their mind (or they can read\nother people\u2019s minds).\nWhen you see a person on the street talking to themselves or shouting at other people, they\nare experiencing hallucinations. These are perceptual experiences that occur even when\nthere is no stimulus in the outside world generating the experiences. They can be auditory,\nvisual, olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), or somatic (touch). The most common hallucinations\nin psychosis (at least in adults) are auditory, and can involve one or more voices talking about\nthe person, commenting on the person\u2019s behavior, or giving them orders. The content of the\nhallucinations is frequently negative (\u201cyou are a loser,\u201d \u201cthat drawing is stupid,\u201d \u201cyou should\ngo kill yourself\u201d) and can be the voice of someone the person knows or a complete stranger.\nSometimes the voices sound as if they are coming from outside the person\u2019s head. Other\ntimes the voices seem to be coming from inside the person\u2019s head, but are not experienced\nthe same as the person\u2019s inner thoughts or inner speech.\nTalking to someone with schizophrenia is sometimes difficult, as their speech may be difficult\nto follow, either because their answers do not clearly flow from your questions, or because\none sentence does not logically follow from another. This is referred to as disorganized Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders 446\nspeech, and it can be present even when the person is writing. Disorganized behavior can\ninclude odd dress, odd makeup (e.g., lipstick outlining a mouth for 1 inch), or unusual rituals\n(e.g., repetitive hand gestures). Abnormal motor behavior can include catatonia, which refers\nto a variety of behaviors that seem to reflect a reduction in responsiveness to the external\nenvironment. This can include holding unusual postures for long periods of time, failing to\nrespond to verbal or motor prompts from another person, or excessive and seemingly\npurposeless motor activity.\nSome of the most debilitating\nsymptoms of schizophrenia are\ndifficult for others to see. These\ninclude what people refer to as\n\u201cnegative symptoms\u201d or the absence\nof certain things we typically expect\nmost people to have. For example,\nanhedonia or amotivation reflect a\nlack of apparent interest in or drive to\nengage in social or recreational\nactivities. These symptoms can\nmanifest as a great amount of time\nspent in physical immobility. Importantly,\n\"Negative symptoms\" of schizophrenia like anhedonia - a lack of interest anhedonia and amotivation do not\nin the kinds of social and recreational activities most others enjoy - are\nseem to reflect a lack of enjoyment in\nnot as readily apparent to outside observers as the more obvious\npleasurable activities or events\nsymptoms like disorganized speech or talk of hallucinations. [Photo:\n(Cohen & Minor, 2010; Kring & Moran,\nJessia Hime]\n2008; Llerena, Strauss, & Cohen,\n2012) but rather a reduced drive or ability to take the steps necessary to obtain the potentially\npositive outcomes (Barch & Dowd, 2010). Flat affect and reduced speech (alogia) reflect a\nlack of showing emotions through facial expressions, gestures, and speech intonation, as well\nas a reduced amount of speech and increased pause frequency and duration.\nIn many ways, the types of symptoms associated with psychosis are the most difficult for us\nto understand, as they may seem far outside the range of our normal experiences. Unlike\ndepression or anxiety, many of us may not have had experiences that we think of as on the\nsame continuum as psychosis. However, just like many of the other forms of psychopathology\ndescribed in this book, the types of psychotic symptoms that characterize disorders like\nschizophrenia are on a continuum with \u201cnormal\u201d mental experiences. For example, work by\nJim van Os in the Netherlands has shown that a surprisingly large percentage of the general\npopulation (10%+) experience psychotic-like symptoms, though many fewer have multiple Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders 447\nexperiences and most will not continue to experience these symptoms in the long run (Verdoux\n& van Os, 2002). Similarly, work in a general population of adolescents and young adults in\nKenya has also shown that a relatively high percentage of individuals experience one or more\npsychotic-like experiences (~19%) at some point in their lives (Mamah et al., 2012; Ndetei et\nal., 2012), though again most will not go on to develop a full-blown psychotic disorder.\nSchizophrenia is the primary disorder that comes to mind when we discuss \u201cpsychotic\u201d\ndisorders (see Table 1 for diagnostic criteria), though there are a number of other disorders\nTable 1: Types of Psychotic Disorders (Simplified from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - 5th Edition (DSM-5) (APA, 2013) Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders 448\nthat share one or more features with schizophrenia. In the remainder of this module, we will\nuse the terms \u201cpsychosis\u201d and \u201cschizophrenia\u201d somewhat interchangeably, given that most of\nthe research has focused on schizophrenia. In addition to schizophrenia (see Table 1), other\npsychotic disorders include schizophreniform disorder (a briefer version of schizophrenia),\nschizoaffective disorder (a mixture of psychosis and depression/mania symptoms), delusional\ndisorder (the experience of only delusions), and brief psychotic disorder (psychotic symptoms\nthat last only a few days or weeks).\nThe Cognitive Neuroscience of Schizophrenia\nAs described above, when we think of the core symptoms of psychotic disorders such as\nschizophrenia, we think of people who hear voices, see visions, and have false beliefs about\nreality (i.e., delusions). However, problems in cognitive function are also a critical aspect of\npsychotic disorders and of schizophrenia in particular. This emphasis on cognition in\nschizophrenia is in part due to the growing body of research suggesting that cognitive\nproblems in schizophrenia are a major source of disability and loss of functional capacity\n(Green, 2006; Nuechterlein et al., 2011). The cognitive deficits that are present in schizophrenia\nare widespread and can include problems with episodic memory (the ability to learn and\nretrieve new information or episodes in one\u2019s life), working memory (the ability to maintain\ninformation over a short period of time, such as 30 seconds), and other tasks that require one\nto \u201ccontrol\u201d or regulate one\u2019s behavior (Barch & Ceaser, 2012; Bora, Yucel, & Pantelis, 2009a;\nFioravanti, Carlone, Vitale, Cinti, & Clare, 2005; Forbes, Carrick, McIntosh, & Lawrie, 2009;\nMesholam-Gately, Giuliano, Goff, Faraone, & Seidman, 2009). Individuals with schizophrenia\nalso have difficulty with what is referred to as \u201cprocessing speed\u201d and are frequently slower\nthan healthy individuals on almost all tasks. Importantly, these cognitive deficits are present\nprior to the onset of the illness (Fusar-Poli et al., 2007) and are also present, albeit in a milder\nform, in the first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia (Snitz, Macdonald, & Carter,\n2006). This suggests that cognitive impairments in schizophrenia reflect part of the risk for\nthe development of psychosis, rather than being an outcome of developing psychosis. Further,\npeople with schizophrenia who have more severe cognitive problems also tend to have more\nsevere negative symptoms and more disorganized speech and behavior (Barch, Carter, &\nCohen, 2003; Barch et al., 1999; Dominguez Mde, Viechtbauer, Simons, van Os, & Krabbendam,\n2009; Ventura, Hellemann, Thames, Koellner, & Nuechterlein, 2009; Ventura, Thames, Wood,\nGuzik, & Hellemann, 2010). In addition, people with more cognitive problems have worse\nfunction in everyday life (Bowie et al., 2008; Bowie, Reichenberg, Patterson, Heaton, & Harvey,\n2006; Fett et al., 2011).\nSome people with schizophrenia also show deficits in what is referred to as social cognition, Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders 449\nthough it is not clear whether such\nproblems are separate from the\ncognitive problems described above or\nthe result of them (Hoe, Nakagami,\nGreen, & Brekke, 2012; Kerr & Neale,\n1993; van Hooren et al., 2008). This\nincludes problems with the recognition\nof emotional expressions on the faces\nof other individuals (Kohler, Walker,\nMartin, Healey, & Moberg, 2010) and\nproblems inferring the intentions of\nother people (theory of mind) (Bora,\nYucel, & Pantelis, 2009b). Individuals\nwith schizophrenia who have more\nproblems with social cognition also\ntend to have more negative and\nSome with schizophrenia suffer from difficulty with social cognition.\ndisorganized symptoms (Ventura, Wood,\nThey may not be able to detect the meaning of facial expressions or\nother subtle cues that most other people rely on to navigate the social & Hellemann, 2011), as well as worse\nworld. [Photo: Wolfgangfoto] community function (Fett et al., 2011).\nThe advent of neuroimaging techniques such as structural and functional magnetic resonance\nimaging and positron emission tomography opened up the ability to try to understand the\nbrain mechanisms of the symptoms of schizophrenia as well as the cognitive impairments\nfound in psychosis. For example, a number of studies have suggested that delusions in\npsychosis may be associated with problems in \u201csalience\u201d detection mechanisms supported\nby the ventral striatum (Jensen & Kapur, 2009; Jensen et al., 2008; Kapur, 2003; Kapur, Mizrahi,\n& Li, 2005; Murray et al., 2008) and the anterior prefrontal cortex (Corlett et al., 2006; Corlett,\nHoney, & Fletcher, 2007; Corlett, Murray, et al., 2007a, 2007b). These are regions of the brain\nthat normally increase their activity when something important (aka \u201csalient\u201d) happens in the\nenvironment. If these brain regions misfire, it may lead individuals with psychosis to mistakenly\nattribute importance to irrelevant or unconnected events. Further, there is good evidence\nthat problems in working memory and cognitive control in schizophrenia are related to\nproblems in the function of a region of the brain called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\n(DLPFC) (Minzenberg, Laird, Thelen, Carter, & Glahn, 2009; Ragland et al., 2009). These\nproblems include changes in how the DLPFC works when people are doing working-memory\nor cognitive-control tasks, and problems with how this brain region is connected to other brain\nregions important for working memory and cognitive control, including the posterior parietal\ncortex (e.g., Karlsgodt et al., 2008; J. J. Kim et al., 2003; Schlosser et al., 2003), the anterior\ncingulate (Repovs & Barch, 2012), and temporal cortex (e.g., Fletcher et al., 1995; Meyer- Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders 450\nLindenberg et al., 2001). In terms of understanding episodic memory problems in\nschizophrenia, many researchers have focused on medial temporal lobe deficits, with a specific\nfocus on the hippocampus (e.g., Heckers & Konradi, 2010). This is because there is much data\nfrom humans and animals showing that the hippocampus is important for the creation of\nnew memories (Squire, 1992). However, it has become increasingly clear that problems with\nthe DLPFC also make important contributions to episodic memory deficits in schizophrenia\n(Ragland et al., 2009), probably because this part of the brain is important for controlling our\nuse of memory.\nIn addition to problems with regions such as the DLFPC and medial temporal lobes in\nschizophrenia described above, magnitude resonance neuroimaging studies have also\nidentified changes in cellular architecture, white matter connectivity, and gray matter volume\nin a variety of regions that include the prefrontal and temporal cortices (Bora et al., 2011).\nPeople with schizophrenia also show reduced overall brain volume, and reductions in brain\nvolume as people get older may be larger in those with schizophrenia than in healthy people\n(Olabi et al., 2011). Taking antipsychotic medications or taking drugs such as marijuana,\nalcohol, and tobacco may cause some of these structural changes. However, these structural\nchanges are not completely explained by medications or substance use alone. Further, both\nfunctional and structural brain changes are seen, again to a milder degree, in the first-degree\nrelatives of people with schizophrenia (Boos, Aleman, Cahn, Pol, & Kahn, 2007; Brans et al.,\n2008; Fusar-Poli et al., 2007; MacDonald, Thermenos, Barch, & Seidman, 2009). This again\nsuggests that that neural changes associated with schizophrenia are related to a genetic risk\nfor this illness.\nRisk Factors for Developing Schizophrenia\nIt is clear that there are important genetic contributions to the likelihood that someone will\ndevelop schizophrenia, with consistent evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies.\n(Sullivan, Kendler, & Neale, 2003). However, there is no \u201cschizophrenia gene\u201d and it is likely\nthat the genetic risk for schizophrenia reflects the summation of many different genes that\neach contribute something to the likelihood of developing psychosis (Gottesman & Shields,\n1967; Owen, Craddock, & O'Donovan, 2010). Further, schizophrenia is a very heterogeneous\ndisorder, which means that two different people with \u201cschizophrenia\u201d may each have very\ndifferent symptoms (e.g., one has hallucinations and delusions, the other has disorganized\nspeech and negative symptoms). This makes it even more challenging to identify specific genes\nassociated with risk for psychosis. Importantly, many studies also now suggest that at least\nsome of the genes potentially associated with schizophrenia are also associated with other\nmental health conditions, including bipolar disorder, depression, and autism (Gejman, Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders 451\nSanders, & Kendler, 2011; Y. Kim, Zerwas, Trace, & Sullivan, 2011; Owen et al., 2010; Rutter,\nKim-Cohen, & Maughan, 2006).\nThere are also a number of environmental\nfactors that are associated with an increased\nrisk of developing schizophrenia. For example,\nproblems during pregnancy such as increased\nstress, infection, malnutrition, and/or diabetes\nhave been associated with increased risk of\nschizophrenia. In addition, complications that\noccur at the time of birth and which cause\nhypoxia (lack of oxygen) are also associated\nwith an increased risk for developing\nschizophrenia (M. Cannon, Jones, & Murray,\n2002; Miller et al., 2011). Children born to older\nfathers are also at a somewhat increased risk\nof developing schizophrenia. Further, using\ncannabis increases risk for developing\npsychosis, especially if you have other risk\nfactors (Casadio, Fernandes, Murray, & Di Forti,\n2011; Luzi, Morrison, Powell, di Forti, & Murray,\n2008). The likelihood of developing schizophrenia\nis also higher for kids who grow up in urban\nsettings (March et al., 2008) and for some\nThere are a number of biological risk factors for\nminority ethnic groups (Bourque, van der Ven,\nschizophrenia including older fathers, complications\n& Malla, 2011). Both of these factors may reflect during pregnancy/delivery and a family history of\nhigher social and environmental stress in these schizophrenia. [Photo: Mattnic]\nsettings. Unfortunately, none of these risk\nfactors is specific enough to be particularly useful in a clinical setting, and most people with\nthese \u201crisk\u201d factors do not develop schizophrenia. However, together they are beginning to\ngive us clues as the neurodevelopmental factors that may lead someone to be at an increased\nrisk for developing this disease.\nAn important research area on risk for psychosis has been work with individuals who may be\nat \u201cclinical high risk.\u201d These are individuals who are showing attenuated (milder) symptoms\nof psychosis that have developed recently and who are experiencing some distress or disability\nassociated with these symptoms. When people with these types of symptoms are followed\nover time, about 35% of them develop a psychotic disorder (T. D. Cannon et al., 2008), most\nfrequently schizophrenia (Fusar-Poli, McGuire, & Borgwardt, 2012). In order to identify these Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders 452\nindividuals, a new category of diagnosis, called \u201cAttenuated Psychotic Syndrome,\u201d was added\nto Section III (the section for disorders in need of further study) of the DSM-5 (see Table 1 for\nsymptoms) (APA, 2013). However, adding this diagnostic category to the DSM-5 created a good\ndeal of controversy (Batstra & Frances, 2012; Fusar-Poli & Yung, 2012). Many scientists and\nclinicians have been worried that including \u201crisk\u201d states in the DSM-5 would create mental\ndisorders where none exist, that these individuals are often already seeking treatment for\nother problems, and that it is not clear that we have good treatments to stop these individuals\nfrom developing to psychosis. However, the counterarguments have been that there is\nevidence that individuals with high-risk symptoms develop psychosis at a much higher rate\nthan individuals with other types of psychiatric symptoms, and that the inclusion of Attenuated\nPsychotic Syndrome in Section III will spur important research that might have clinical benefits.\nFurther, there is some evidence that non-invasive treatments such as omega-3 fatty acids and\nintensive family intervention may help reduce the development of full-blown psychosis (Preti\n& Cella, 2010) in people who have high-risk symptoms.\nTreatment of Schizophrenia\nThe currently available treatments for schizophrenia leave much to be desired, and the search\nfor more effective treatments for both the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g.,\nhallucinations and delusions) as well as cognitive deficits and negative symptoms is a highly\nactive area of research. The first line of treatment for schizophrenia and other psychotic\ndisorders is the use of antipsychotic medications. There are two primary types of antipsychotic\nmedications, referred to as \u201ctypical\u201d and \u201catypical.\u201d The fact that \u201ctypical\u201d antipsychotics helped\nsome symptoms of schizophrenia was discovered serendipitously more than 60 years ago\n(Carpenter & Davis, 2012; Lopez-Munoz et al., 2005). These are drugs that all share a common\nfeature of being a strong block of the D2 type dopamine receptor. Although these drugs can\nhelp reduce hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech, they do little to improve\ncognitive deficits or negative symptoms and can be associated with distressing motor side\neffects. The newer generation of antipsychotics is referred to as \u201catypical\u201d antipsychotics.\nThese drugs have more mixed mechanisms of action in terms of the receptor types that they\ninfluence, though most of them also influence D2 receptors. These newer antipsychotics are\nnot necessarily more helpful for schizophrenia but have fewer motor side effects. However,\nmany of the atypical antipsychotics are associated with side effects referred to as the\n\u201cmetabolic syndrome,\u201d which includes weight gain and increased risk for cardiovascular illness,\nType-2 diabetes, and mortality (Lieberman et al., 2005).\nThe evidence that cognitive deficits also contribute to functional impairment in schizophrenia\nhas led to an increased search for treatments that might enhance cognitive function in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders 453\nschizophrenia. Unfortunately, as of yet, there are no pharmacological treatments that work\nconsistently to improve cognition in schizophrenia, though many new types of drugs are\ncurrently under exploration. However, there is a type of psychological intervention, referred\nto as cognitive remediation, which has shown some evidence of helping cognition and function\nin schizophrenia. In particular, a version of this treatment called Cognitive Enhancement\nTherapy (CET) has been shown to improve cognition, functional outcome, social cognition,\nand to protect against gray matter loss (Eack et al., 2009; Eack, Greenwald, Hogarty, &\nKeshavan, 2010; Eack et al., 2010; Eack, Pogue-Geile, Greenwald, Hogarty, & Keshavan, 2010;\nHogarty, Greenwald, & Eack, 2006) in young individuals with schizophrenia. The development\nof new treatments such as Cognitive Enhancement Therapy provides some hope that we will\nbe able to develop new and better approaches to improving the lives of individuals with this\nserious mental health condition and potentially even prevent it some day.

Jade Wu\nIn the past century, a number of psychotherapeutic orientations have gained popularity for\ntreating mental illnesses. This module outlines some of the best-known therapeutic\napproaches and explains the history, techniques, advantages, and disadvantages associated\nwith each. The most effective modern approach is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We also\ndiscuss psychoanalytic therapy, person-centered therapy, and mindfulness-based\napproaches. Drug therapy and emerging new treatment strategies will also be briefly explored.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Become familiar with the most widely practiced approaches to psychotherapy.\n\u2022 For each therapeutic approach, consider: history, goals, key techniques, and empirical\nsupport.\n\u2022 Consider the impact of emerging treatment strategies in mental health.\nIntroduction\nThe history of mental illness can be traced as far back as 1500 BCE, when the ancient Egyptians\nnoted cases of \u201cdistorted concentration\u201d and \u201cemotional distress in the heart or mind\u201d (Nasser,\n1987). Today, nearly half of all Americans will experience mental illness at some point in their\nlives, and mental health problems affect more than one-quarter of the population in any given\nyear (Kessler et al., 2005). Fortunately, a range of psychotherapies exist to treat mental\nillnesses. This module provides an overview of some of the best-known schools of thought in Therapeutic Orientations 467\npsychotherapy.\nCurrently, the most effective approach is\ncalled Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT);\nhowever, other approaches, such as\npsychoanalytic therapy, person-centered\ntherapy, and mindfulness-based therapies\nare also used\u2014though the effectiveness of\nthese treatments aren\u2019t as clear as they are\nfor CBT. Throughout this module, note the\nadvantages and disadvantages of each\napproach, paying special attention to their\nsupport by empirical research.\nCBT is an approach to treating mental illness that involves work\nwith a therapist as well as homework assignments between\nPsychoanalysis and\nsessions. It has proven to be very effective for virtually all\npsychiatric illnesses. [Image: Research Report Series: Psychodynamic Therapy\nTherapeutic Community. Wikimedia Commons]\nThe earliest organized therapy for mental disorders was psychoanalysis. Made famous in the\nearly 20th century by one of the best-known clinicians of all time, Sigmund Freud, this approach\nstresses that mental health problems are rooted in unconscious conflicts and desires. In order\nto resolve the mental illness, then, these unconscious struggles must be identified and\naddressed. Psychoanalysis often does this through exploring one\u2019s early childhood\nexperiences that may have continuing repercussions on one\u2019s mental health in the present\nand later in life. Psychoanalysis is an intensive, long-term approach in which patients and\ntherapists may meet multiple times per week, often for many years.\nHistory of Psychoanalytic Therapy\nFreud initially suggested that mental health problems arise from efforts to push inappropriate\nsexual urges out of conscious awareness (Freud, 1895/1955). Later, Freud suggested more\ngenerally that psychiatric problems are the result of tension between different parts of the\nmind: the id, the superego, and the ego. In Freud\u2019s structural model, the id represents pleasure-\ndriven unconscious urges (e.g., our animalistic desires for sex and aggression), while the\nsuperego is the semi-conscious part of the mind where morals and societal judgment are\ninternalized (e.g., the part of you that automatically knows how society expects you to behave).\nThe ego\u2014also partly conscious\u2014mediates between the id and superego. Freud believed that\nbringing unconscious struggles like these (where the id demands one thing and the superego Therapeutic Orientations 468\nanother) into conscious awareness would relieve the stress of the conflict (Freud, 1920/1955)\n\u2014which became the goal of psychoanalytic therapy.\nAlthough psychoanalysis is still practiced today, it has largely been replaced by the more\nbroadly defined psychodynamic therapy. This latter approach has the same basic tenets as\npsychoanalysis, but is briefer, makes more of an effort to put clients in their social and\ninterpersonal context, and focuses more on relieving psychological distress than on changing\nthe person.\nTechniques in Psychoanalysis\nPsychoanalysts and psychodynamic therapists\nemploy several techniques to explore patients\u2019\nunconscious mind. One common technique is\ncalled free association. Here, the patient\nshares any and all thoughts that come to mind,\nwithout attempting to organize or censor\nthem in any way. For example, if you took a\npen and paper and just wrote down whatever\ncame into your head, letting one thought lead\nto the next without allowing conscious\ncriticism to shape what you were writing, you\nwould be doing free association. The analyst\nthen uses his or her expertise to discern\npatterns or underlying meaning in the\npatient\u2019s thoughts.\nSometimes, free association exercises are\napplied specifically to childhood recollections.\nThat is, psychoanalysts believe a person\u2019s\nBuilding on the work of Josef Breuer and others, Sigmund\nchildhood relationships with caregivers often\nFreud developed psychotherapeutic theories and techniques\nthat became widely known as psychoanalysis or determine the way that person relates to\npsychoanalytic therapy. [Photo: Psychology Pictures] others, and predicts later psychiatric\ndifficulties. Thus, exploring these childhood\nmemories, through free association or otherwise, can provide therapists with insights into a\npatient\u2019s psychological makeup.\nBecause we don\u2019t always have the ability to consciously recall these deep memories, Therapeutic Orientations 469\npsychoanalysts also discuss their patients\u2019 dreams. In Freudian theory, dreams contain not\nonly manifest (or literal) content, but also latent (or symbolic) content (Freud, 1900; 1955). For\nexample, someone may have a dream that his/her teeth are falling out\u2014the manifest or actual\ncontent of the dream. However, dreaming that one\u2019s teeth are falling out could be a reflection\nof the person\u2019s unconscious concern about losing his or her physical attractiveness\u2014the latent\nor metaphorical content of the dream. It is the therapist\u2019s job to help discover the latent\ncontent underlying one\u2019s manifest content through dream analysis.\nIn psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapy, the therapist plays a receptive role\u2014\ninterpreting the patient\u2019s thoughts and behavior based on clinical experience and\npsychoanalytic theory. For example, if during therapy a patient begins to express unjustified\nanger toward the therapist, the therapist may recognize this as an act of transference. That is,\nthe patient may be displacing feelings for people in his or her life (e.g., anger toward a parent)\nonto the therapist. At the same time, though, the therapist has to be aware of his or her own\nthoughts and emotions, for, in a related process, called countertransference, the therapist may\ndisplace his/her own emotions onto the patient.\nThe key to psychoanalytic theory is to have patients uncover the buried, conflicting content\nof their mind, and therapists use various tactics\u2014such as seating patients to face away from\nthem\u2014to promote a freer self-disclosure. And, as a therapist spends more time with a patient,\nthe therapist can come to view his or her relationship with the patient as another reflection\nof the patient\u2019s mind.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Psychoanalytic Therapy\nPsychoanalysis was once the only type of psychotherapy available, but presently the number\nof therapists practicing this approach is decreasing around the world. Psychoanalysis is not\nappropriate for some types of patients, including those with severe psychopathology or\nmental retardation. Further, psychoanalysis is often expensive because treatment usually\nlasts many years. Still, some patients and therapists find the prolonged and detailed analysis\nvery rewarding.\nPerhaps the greatest disadvantage of psychoanalysis and related approaches is the lack of\nempirical support for their effectiveness. The limited research that has been conducted on\nthese treatments suggests that they do not reliably lead to better mental health outcomes (e.\ng., Driessen et al., 2010). And, although there are some reviews that seem to indicate that\nlong-term psychodynamic therapies might be beneficial (e.g., Leichsenring & Rabung, 2008),\nother researchers have questioned the validity of these reviews. Nevertheless, psychoanalytic Therapeutic Orientations 470\ntheory was history\u2019s first attempt at formal treatment of mental illness, setting the stage for\nthe more modern approaches used today.\nHumanistic and Person-Centered Therapy\nOne of the next developments in therapy for mental illness, which arrived in the mid-20th\ncentury, is called humanistic or person-centered therapy (PCT). Here, the belief is that mental\nhealth problems result from an inconsistency between patients\u2019 behavior and their true\npersonal identity. Thus, the goal of PCT is to create conditions under which patients can\ndiscover their self-worth, feel comfortable exploring their own identity, and alter their behavior\nto better reflect this identity.\nHistory of Person-Centered Therapy\nPCT was developed by a psychologist named Carl Rogers,\nduring a time of significant growth in the movements of\nhumanistic theory and human potential. These\nperspectives were based on the idea that humans have\nan inherent drive to realize and express their own\ncapabilities and creativity. Rogers, in particular, believed\nthat all people have the potential to change and improve,\nand that the role of therapists is to foster self-\nunderstanding in an environment where adaptive\nchange is most likely to occur (Rogers, 1951). Rogers\nsuggested that the therapist and patient must engage in\na genuine, egalitarian relationship in which the therapist\nis nonjudgmental and empathetic. In PCT, the patient\nshould experience both a vulnerability to anxiety, which\nCarl Rogers, the father of Person Centered motivates the desire to change, and an appreciation for\nTherapy (CPT). [Image: Didius at nl.wikipedia\nthe therapist\u2019s support.\n- wikimedia commons]\nTechniques in Person-Centered Therapy\nHumanistic and person-centered therapy, like psychoanalysis, involves a largely unstructured\nconversation between the therapist and the patient. Unlike psychoanalysis, though, a therapist\nusing PCT takes a passive role, guiding the patient toward his or her own self-discovery.\nRogers\u2019s original name for PCT was non-directive therapy, and this notion is reflected in the Therapeutic Orientations 471\nflexibility found in PCT. Therapists do not try to change patients\u2019 thoughts or behaviors directly.\nRather, their role is to provide the therapeutic relationship as a platform for personal growth.\nIn these kinds of sessions, the therapist tends only to ask questions and doesn\u2019t provide any\njudgment or interpretation of what the patient says. Instead, the therapist is present to provide\na safe and encouraging environment for the person to explore these issues for him- or herself.\nAn important aspect of the PCT relationship is the therapist\u2019s unconditional positive regard\nfor the patient\u2019s feelings and behaviors. That is, the therapist is never to condemn or criticize\nthe patient for what s/he has done or thought; the therapist is only to express warmth and\nempathy. This creates an environment free of approval or disapproval, where patients come\nto appreciate their value and to behave in ways that are congruent with their own identity.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Person-Centered Therapy\nOne key advantage of person-centered therapy is that it is highly acceptable to patients. In\nother words, people tend to find the supportive, flexible environment of this approach very\nrewarding. Furthermore, some of the themes of PCT translate well to other therapeutic\napproaches. For example, most therapists of any orientation find that clients respond well to\nbeing treated with nonjudgmental empathy. The main disadvantage to PCT, however, is that\nfindings about its effectiveness are mixed. One possibility for this could be that the treatment\nis primarily based on unspecific treatment factors. That is, rather than using therapeutic\ntechniques that are specific to the patient and the mental problem (i.e., specific treatment\nfactors), the therapy focuses on techniques that can be applied to anyone (e.g., establishing\na good relationship with the patient) (Cuijpers et al., 2012; Friedli, King, Lloyd, & Horder, 1997).\nSimilar to how \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d doesn\u2019t really fit every person, PCT uses the same practices\nfor everyone, which may work for some people but not others. Further research is necessary\nto evaluate its utility as a therapeutic approach.\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\nAlthough both psychoanalysis and PCT are still used today, another therapy, cognitive-\nbehavioral therapy (CBT), has gained more widespread support and practice. CBT refers to\na family of therapeutic approaches whose goal is to alleviate psychological symptoms by\nchanging their underlying cognitions and behaviors. The premise of CBT is that thoughts,\nbehaviors, and emotions interact and contribute to various mental disorders. For example,\nlet\u2019s consider how a CBT therapist would view a patient who compulsively washes her hands\nfor hours every day. First, the therapist would identify the patient\u2019s maladaptive thought: \u201cIf\nI don\u2019t wash my hands like this, I will get a disease and die.\u201d The therapist then identifies how Therapeutic Orientations 472\nthis maladaptive thought leads to a maladaptive emotion: the feeling of anxiety when her\nhands aren\u2019t being washed. And finally, this maladaptive emotion leads to the maladaptive\nbehavior: the patient washing her hands for hours every day.\nCBT is a present-focused therapy (i.e., focused on the \u201cnow\u201d rather than causes from the past,\nsuch as childhood relationships) that uses behavioral goals to improve one\u2019s mental illness.\nOften, these behavioral goals involve between-session homework assignments. For example,\nthe therapist may give the hand-washing patient a worksheet to take home; on this worksheet,\nthe woman is to write down every time she feels the urge to wash her hands, how she deals\nwith the urge, and what behavior she replaces that urge with. When the patient has her next\ntherapy session, she and the therapist review her \u201chomework\u201d together. CBT is a relatively\nbrief intervention of 12 to 16 weekly sessions, closely tailored to the nature of the\npsychopathology and treatment of the specific mental disorder. And, as the empirical data\nshows, CBT has proven to be highly efficacious for virtually all psychiatric illnesses (Hofmann,\nAsnaani, Vonk, Sawyer, & Fang, 2012).\nPattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors addressed through cognitive-\nbehavioral therapy.\nHistory of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\nCBT developed from clinical work conducted in the mid-20th century by Dr. Aaron T. Beck, a Therapeutic Orientations 473\npsychiatrist, and Albert Ellis, a psychologist. Beck used the term automatic thoughts to refer\nto the thoughts depressed patients report experiencing spontaneously. He observed that\nthese thoughts arise from three belief systems, or schemas: beliefs about the self, beliefs\nabout the world, and beliefs about the future. In treatment, therapy initially focuses on\nidentifying automatic thoughts (e.g., \u201cIf I don\u2019t wash my hands constantly, I\u2019ll get a disease\u201d),\ntesting their validity, and replacing maladaptive thoughts with more adaptive thoughts (e.g.,\n\u201cWashing my hands three times a day is sufficient to prevent a disease\u201d). In later stages of\ntreatment, the patient\u2019s maladaptive schemas are examined and modified. Ellis (1957) took\na comparable approach, in what he called rational-emotive-behavioral therapy (REBT), which\nalso encourages patients to evaluate their own thoughts about situations.\nTechniques in CBT\nBeck and Ellis strove to help patients identify maladaptive appraisals, or the untrue judgments\nand evaluations of certain thoughts. For example, if it\u2019s your first time meeting new people,\nyou may have the automatic thought, \u201cThese people won\u2019t like me because I have nothing\ninteresting to share.\u201d That thought itself\nis not what\u2019s troublesome; the appraisal\n(or evaluation) that it might have merit is\nwhat\u2019s troublesome. The goal of CBT is to\nhelp people make adaptive, instead of\nmaladaptive, appraisals (e.g., \u201cI do know\ninteresting things!\u201d). This technique of\nreappraisal, or cognitive restructuring,\nis a fundamental aspect of CBT. With\ncognitive restructuring, it is the therapist\u2019s\njob to help point out when a person has\nan inaccurate or maladaptive thought, so\nthat the patient can either eliminate it or\nmodify it to be more adaptive.\nIn addition to thoughts, though, another\nimportant treatment target of CBT is\nmaladaptive behavior. Every time a\nperson engages in maladaptive behavior\n(e.g., never speaking to someone in new\nsituations), he or she reinforces the\nvalidity of the maladaptive thought, thus Therapeutic Orientations 474\nmaintaining or perpetuating the psychological illness. In treatment, the therapist and patient\nwork together to develop healthy behavioral habits (often tracked with worksheet-like\nhomework), so that the patient can break this cycle of maladaptive thoughts and behaviors.\nFor many mental health problems, especially anxiety disorders, CBT incorporates what is\nknown as exposure therapy. During exposure therapy, a patient confronts a problematic\nsituation and fully engages in the experience instead of avoiding it. For example, imagine a\nman who is terrified of spiders. Whenever he encounters one, he immediately screams and\npanics. In exposure therapy, the man would be forced to confront and interact with spiders,\nrather than simply avoiding them as he usually does. The goal is to reduce the fear associated\nwith the situation through extinction learning, a neurobiological and cognitive process by which\nthe patient \u201cunlearns\u201d the irrational fear. For example, exposure therapy for someone terrified\nof spiders might begin with him looking at a cartoon of a spider, followed by him looking at\npictures of real spiders, and later, him handling a plastic spider. After weeks of this incremental\nexposure, the patient may even be able to hold a live spider. After repeated exposure (starting\nsmall and building one\u2019s way up), the patient experiences less physiological fear and\nmaladaptive thoughts about spiders, breaking his tendency for anxiety and subsequent\navoidance.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of CBT\nCBT interventions tend to be relatively brief, making them cost-effective for the average\nconsumer. In addition, CBT is an intuitive treatment that makes logical sense to patients. It\ncan also be adapted to suit the needs of many different populations. One disadvantage,\nhowever, is that CBT does involve significant effort on the patient\u2019s part, because the patient\nis an active participant in treatment. Therapists often assign \u201chomework\u201d (e.g., worksheets\nfor recording one\u2019s thoughts and behaviors) between sessions to maintain the cognitive and\nbehavioral habits the patient is working on. The greatest strength of CBT is the abundance of\nempirical support for its effectiveness. Studies have consistently found CBT to be equally or\nmore effective than other forms of treatment, including medication and other therapies\n(Butler, Chapman, Forman, & Beck, 2006; Hofmann et al., 2012). For this reason, CBT is\nconsidered a first-line treatment for many mental disorders.\nAcceptance and Mindfulness-Based Approaches\nUnlike the preceding therapies, which were developed in the 20th century, this next one was\nborn out of age-old Buddhist and yoga practices. Mindfulness, or a process that tries to\ncultivate a nonjudgmental, yet attentive, mental state, is a therapy that focuses on one\u2019s Therapeutic Orientations 475\nawareness of bodily sensations, thoughts, and the outside environment. Whereas other\ntherapies work to modify or eliminate these sensations and thoughts, mindfulness focuses\non nonjudgmentally accepting them (Kabat-Zinn, 2003; Baer, 2003). For example, whereas\nCBT may actively confront and work to change a maladaptive thought, mindfulness therapy\nworks to acknowledge and accept the thought, understanding that the thought is spontaneous\nand not what the person truly believes. There are two important components of mindfulness:\n(1) self-regulation of attention, and (2) orientation toward the present moment (Bishop et al.,\n2004). Mindfulness is thought to improve mental health because it draws attention away from\npast and future stressors, encourages acceptance of troubling thoughts and feelings, and\npromotes physical relaxation.\nTechniques in Mindfulness-Based Therapy\nPsychologists have adapted the practice of mindfulness as a form of psychotherapy, generally\ncalled mindfulness-based therapy (MBT). Several types of MBT have become popular in recent\nyears, including mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) (e.g., Kabat-Zinn, 1982) and\nmindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) (e.g., Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002).\nMBSR uses meditation, yoga, and attention to\nphysical experiences to reduce stress. The hope\nis that reducing a person\u2019s overall stress will allow\nthat person to more objectively evaluate his or\nher thoughts. In MBCT, rather than reducing one\u2019s\ngeneral stress to address a specific problem,\nattention is focused on one\u2019s thoughts and their\nassociated emotions. For example, MBCT helps\nprevent relapses in depression by encouraging\npatients to evaluate their own thoughts\nobjectively and without value judgment (Baer,\n2003). Although cognitive behavioral therapy\n(CBT) may seem similar to this, it focuses on\n\u201cpushing out\u201d the maladaptive thought, whereas\nmindfulness-based cognitive therapy focuses on\nOne of the most important advantages of mindfulness \u201cnot getting caught up\u201d in it. The treatments used\nbased therapy is its level of accessibility to patients. in MBCT have been used to address a wide range\n[Photo: wmacphail] of illnesses, including depression, anxiety, chronic\npain, coronary artery disease, and fibromyalgia\n(Hofmann, Sawyer, Witt & Oh, 2010). Therapeutic Orientations 476\nMindfulness and acceptance\u2014in addition to being therapies in their own right\u2014have also\nbeen used as \u201ctools\u201d in other cognitive-behavioral therapies, particularly in dialectical\nbehavior therapy (DBT) (e.g., Linehan, Amstrong, Suarez, Allmon, & Heard, 1991). DBT, often\nused in the treatment of borderline personality disorder, focuses on skills training. That is, it\noften employs mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy practices, but it also works to\nteach its patients \u201cskills\u201d they can use to correct maladaptive tendencies. For example, one\nskill DBT teaches patients is called distress tolerance\u2014or, ways to cope with maladaptive\nthoughts and emotions in the moment. For example, people who feel an urge to cut\nthemselves may be taught to snap their arm with a rubber band instead. The primary\ndifference between DBT and CBT is that DBT employs techniques that address the symptoms\nof the problem (e.g., cutting oneself) rather than the problem itself (e.g., understanding the\npsychological motivation to cut oneself). CBT does not teach such skills training because of\nthe concern that the skills\u2014even though they may help in the short-term\u2014may be harmful\nin the long-term, by maintaining maladaptive thoughts and behaviors.\nDBT is founded on the perspective of a dialectical worldview. That is, rather than thinking of\nthe world as \u201cblack and white,\u201d or \u201conly good and only bad,\u201d it focuses on accepting that some\nthings can have characteristics of both \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad.\u201d So, in a case involving maladaptive\nthoughts, instead of teaching that a thought is entirely bad, DBT tries to help patients be less\njudgmental of their thoughts (as with mindfulness-based therapy) and encourages change\nthrough therapeutic progress, using cognitive-behavioral techniques as well as mindfulness\nexercises.\nAnother form of treatment that also uses mindfulness techniques is acceptance and\ncommitment therapy (ACT) (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999). In this treatment, patients are\ntaught to observe their thoughts from a detached perspective (Hayes et al., 1999). ACT\nencourages patients not to attempt to change or avoid thoughts and emotions they observe\nin themselves, but to recognize which are beneficial and which are harmful. However, the\ndifferences among ACT, CBT, and other mindfulness-based treatments are a topic of\ncontroversy in the current literature.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Mindfulness-Based Therapy\nTwo key advantages of mindfulness-based therapies are their acceptability and accessibility\nto patients. Because yoga and meditation are already widely known in popular culture,\nconsumers of mental healthcare are often interested in trying related psychological therapies.\nCurrently, psychologists have not come to a consensus on the efficacy of MBT, though growing\nevidence supports its effectiveness for treating mood and anxiety disorders. For example, Therapeutic Orientations 477\none review of MBT studies for anxiety and depression found that mindfulness-based\ninterventions generally led to moderate symptom improvement (Hofmann et al., 2010).\nEmerging Treatment Strategies\nWith growth in research and technology,\npsychologists have been able to develop\nnew treatment strategies in recent years.\nOften, these approaches focus on\nenhancing existing treatments, such as\ncognitive-behavioral therapies, through\nthe use of technological advances. For\nexample, internet- and mobile-delivered\ntherapies make psychological treatments\nmore available, through smartphones\nand online access. Clinician-supervised\nonline CBT modules allow patients to\nRecent improvements in video chat technology along with the access treatment from home on their own\nproliferation of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets has\nschedule\u2014an opportunity particularly\nmade online delivery of therapy more commonplace. [Photo:\nimportant for patients with less geographic\nrbieber]\nor socioeconomic access to traditional\ntreatments. Furthermore, smartphones help extend therapy to patients\u2019 daily lives, allowing\nfor symptom tracking, homework reminders, and more frequent therapist contact.\nAnother benefit of technology is cognitive bias modification. Here, patients are given\nexercises, often through the use of video games, aimed at changing their problematic thought\nprocesses. For example, researchers might use a mobile app to train alcohol abusers to avoid\nstimuli related to alcohol. One version of this game flashes four pictures on the screen\u2014three\nalcohol cues (e.g., a can of beer, the front of a bar) and one health-related image (e.g., someone\ndrinking water). The goal is for the patient to tap the healthy picture as fast as s/he can. Games\nlike these aim to target patients\u2019 automatic, subconscious thoughts that may be difficult to\ndirect through conscious effort. That is, by repeatedly tapping the healthy image, the patient\nlearns to \u201cignore\u201d the alcohol cues, so when those cues are encountered in the environment,\nthey will be less likely to trigger the urge to drink. Approaches like these are promising because\nof their accessibility, however they require further research to establish their effectiveness.\nYet another emerging treatment employs CBT-enhancing pharmaceutical agents. Theseare\ndrugs used to improve the effects of therapeutic interventions. Based on research from animal Therapeutic Orientations 478\nexperiments, researchers have found that certain drugs influence the biological processes\nknown to be involved in learning. Thus, if people take these drugs while going through\npsychotherapy, they are better able to \u201clearn\u201d the techniques for improvement. For example,\nthe antibiotic d-cycloserine improves treatment for anxiety disorders by facilitating the\nlearning processes that occur during exposure therapy. Ongoing research in this exciting area\nmay prove to be quite fruitful.\nPharmacological Treatments\nUp until this point, all the therapies we have discussed have been talk-based or meditative\npractices. However, psychiatric medications are also frequently used to treat mental disorders,\nincluding schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. Psychiatric drugs\nare commonly used, in part, because they can be prescribed by general medical practitioners,\nwhereas only trained psychologists are qualified to deliver effective psychotherapy. While\ndrugs and CBT therapies tend to be almost equally effective, choosing the best intervention\ndepends on the disorder and individual being treated, as well as other factors\u2014such as\ntreatment availability and comorbidity (i.e., having multiple mental or physical disorders at\nonce). Although many new drugs have been introduced in recent decades, there is still much\nwe do not understand about their mechanism in the brain. Further research is needed to\nrefine our understanding of both pharmacological and behavioral treatments before we can\nmake firm claims about their effectiveness.\nIntegrative and Eclectic Psychotherapy\nIn discussing therapeutic orientations, it is important to note that some clinicians incorporate\ntechniques from multiple approaches, a practice known as integrative or eclectic\npsychotherapy. For example, a therapist may employ distress tolerance skills from DBT (to\nresolve short-term problems), cognitive reappraisal from CBT (to address long-standing\nissues), and mindfulness-based meditation from MBCT (to reduce overall stress). And, in fact,\nbetween 13% and 42% of therapists have identified their own approaches as integrative or\neclectic (Norcross & Goldfried, 2005).\nConclusion\nThroughout human history we have had to deal with mental illness in one form or another.\nOver time, several schools of thought have emerged for treating these problems. Although\nvarious therapies have been shown to work for specific individuals, cognitive behavioral Therapeutic Orientations 479\ntherapy is currently the treatment most widely supported by empirical research. Still, practices\nlike psychodynamic therapies, person-centered therapy, mindfulness-based treatments, and\nacceptance and commitment therapy have also shown success. And, with recent advances in\nresearch and technology, clinicians are able to enhance these and other therapies to treat\nmore patients more effectively than ever before. However, what is important in the end is\nthat people actually seek out mental health specialists to help them with their problems. One\nof the biggest deterrents to doing so is that people don\u2019t understand what psychotherapy\nreally entails. Through understanding how current practices work, not only can we better\neducate people about how to get the help they need, but we can continue to advance our\ntreatments to be more effective in the future. Therapeutic Orientations 480\nDiscussion Questions\n1. Psychoanalytic theory is no longer the dominant therapeutic approach, because it lacks\nempirical support. Yet many consumers continue to seek psychoanalytic or psychodynamic\ntreatments. Do you think psychoanalysis still has a place in mental health treatment? If so,\nwhy?\n2. What might be some advantages and disadvantages of technological advances in\npsychological treatment? What will psychotherapy look like 100 years from now?\n3. Some people have argued that all therapies are about equally effective, and that they all\naffect change through common factors such as the involvement of a supportive therapist.\nDoes this claim sound reasonable to you? Why or why not?\n4. When choosing a psychological treatment for a specific patient, what factors besides the\ntreatment\u2019s demonstrated efficacy should be taken into account?

If a drug changes your\nperception, or the way you feel or think, the drug exerts effects on your brain and nervous\nsystem. We call drugs that change the way you think or feel psychoactive or psychotropic\ndrugs, and almost everyone has used a psychoactive drug at some point (yes, caffeine counts).\nUnderstanding some of the basics about psychopharmacology can help us better understand\na wide range of things that interest psychologists and others. For example, the\npharmacological treatment of certain neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease\ntells us something about the disease itself. The pharmacological treatments used to treat\npsychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia or depression have undergone amazing\ndevelopment since the 1950s, and the drugs used to treat these disorders tell us something\nabout what is happening in the brain of individuals with these conditions. Finally,\nunderstanding something about the actions of drugs of abuse and their routes of\nadministration can help us understand why some psychoactive drugs are so addictive. In this\nmodule, we will provide an overview of some of these topics as well as discuss some current\ncontroversial areas in the field of psychopharmacology.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 How do the majority of psychoactive drugs work in the brain?\n\u2022 How does the route of administration affect how rewarding a drug might be?\n\u2022 Why is grapefruit dangerous to consume with many psychotropic medications?\n\u2022 Why might individualized drug doses based on genetic screening be helpful for treating\nconditions like depression?\n\u2022 Why is there controversy regarding pharmacotherapy for children, adolescents, and the\nelderly? Psychopharmacology 486\nIntroduction\nPsychopharmacology, the study of how drugs affect the brain and behavior, is a relatively new\nscience, although people have probably been taking drugs to change how they feel from early\nin human history (consider the of eating fermented fruit, ancient beer recipes, chewing on\nthe leaves of the cocaine plant for stimulant properties as just some examples). The word\npsychopharmacology itself tells us that this is a field that bridges our understanding of behavior\n(and brain) and pharmacology, and the range of topics included within this field is extremely\nbroad.\nVirtually any drug that changes the way you feel\ndoes this by altering how neurons communicate\nwith each other. Neurons (more than 100 billion\nin your nervous system) communicate with\neach other by releasing a chemical (neurotransmitter)\nacross a tiny space between two neurons (the\nsynapse). When the neurotransmitter crosses\nthe synapse, it binds to a postsynaptic receptor\n(protein) on the receiving neuron and the\nmessage may then be transmitted onward.\nObviously, neurotransmission is far more\nDrugs that alter our feelings and behavior do so by\ncomplicated than this \u2013 links at the end of this\naffecting the communication between neurons in the\nmodule can provide some useful background if\nbrain. [Photo: Curtis Gregory Perry]\nyou want more detail \u2013 but the first step is\nunderstanding that virtually all psychoactive drugs interfere with or alter how neurons\ncommunicate with each other.\nThere are many neurotransmitters. Some of the most important in terms of\npsychopharmacological treatment and drugs of abuse are outlined in Table 1. The neurons\nthat release these neurotransmitters, for the most part, are localized within specific circuits\nof the brain that mediate these behaviors. Psychoactive drugs can either increase activity at\nthe synapse (these are called agonists) or reduce activity at the synapse (antagonists).\nDifferent drugs do this by different mechanisms, and some examples of agonists and\nantagonists are presented in Table 2. For each example, the drug\u2019s trade name, which is the\nname of the drug provided by the drug company, and generic name (in parentheses) are\nprovided.\nA very useful link at the end of this module shows the various steps involved in Psychopharmacology 487\nTable 1\nneurotransmission and some ways drugs can alter this.\nTable 2 Psychopharmacology 488\nTable 2 provides examples of drugs and their primary mechanism of action, but it is very\nimportant to realize that drugs also have effects on other neurotransmitters. This contributes\nto the kinds of side effects that are observed when someone takes a particular drug. The\nreality is that no drugs currently available work only exactly where we would like in the brain\nor only on a specific neurotransmitter. In many cases, individuals are sometimes prescribed\none psychotropic drug but then may also have to take additional drugs to reduce the side\neffects caused by the initial drug. Sometimes individuals stop taking medication because the\nside effects can be so profound.\nPharmacokinetics: What Is It \u2013 Why Is It Important?\nWhile this section may sound more like pharmacology, it is important to realize how important\npharmacokinetics can be when considering psychoactive drugs. Pharmacokinetics refers to\nhow the body handles a drug that we take. As mentioned earlier, psychoactive drugs exert\ntheir effects on behavior by altering neuronal communication in the brain, and the majority\nof drugs reach the brain by traveling in the blood. The acronym ADME is often used with A\nstanding for absorption (how the drug gets into the blood), Distribution (how the drug gets\nto the organ of interest \u2013 in this module, that is the brain), Metabolism (how the drug is broken\ndown so it no longer exerts its psychoactive effects), and Excretion (how the drug leaves the\nbody). We will talk about a couple of these to show their importance for considering\npsychoactive drugs.\nDrug Administration\nThere are many ways to take drugs, and\nthese routes of drug administration can\nhave a significant impact on how quickly\nthat drug reaches brain. The most\ncommon route of administration is oral\nadministration, which is relatively slow\nand \u2013 perhaps surprisingly \u2013 often the\nmost variable and complex route of\nadministration. Drugs enter the\nstomach and then get absorbed by the\nblood supply and capillaries that line the\nA drug delivered by IV reaches the brain more quickly than if the drug small intestine. The rate of absorption\nis taken orally. While rapid delivery has advantages, there are also can be affected by a variety of factors\nrisks involved with IV administration. [Photo: Bart Heird] including the quantity and the type of Psychopharmacology 489\nfood in the stomach (e.g., fats vs. proteins). This is why the medicine label for some drugs\n(like antibiotics) may specifically state foods that you should or should NOT consume within\nan hour of taking the drug because they can affect the rate of absorption. Two of the most\nrapid routes of administration include inhalation (i.e., smoking or gaseous anesthesia) and\nintravenous (IV) in which the drug is injected directly into the vein and hence the blood supply.\nBoth of these routes of administration can get the drug to brain in less than 10 seconds. IV\nadministration also has the distinction of being the most dangerous because if there is an\nadverse drug reaction, there is very little time to administer any antidote, as in the case of an\nIV heroin overdose.\nWhy might how quickly a drug gets to the brain be important? If a drug activates the reward\ncircuits in the brain AND it reaches the brain very quickly, the drug has a high risk for abuse\nand addiction. Psychostimulants like amphetamine or cocaine are examples of drugs that\nhave high risk for abuse because they are agonists at DA neurons involved in reward AND\nbecause these drugs exist in forms that can be either smoked or injected intravenously. Some\nargue that cigarette smoking is one of the hardest addictions to quit, and although part of\nthe reason for this may be that smoking gets the nicotine into the brain very quickly (and\nindirectly acts on DA neurons), it is a more complicated story. For drugs that reach the brain\nvery quickly, not only is the drug very addictive, but so are the cues associated with the drug\n(see Rohsenow, Niaura, Childress, Abrams, & Monti, 1990). For a crack user, this could be the\npipe that they use to smoke the drug. For a cigarette smoker, however, it could be something\nas normal as finishing dinner or waking up in the morning (if that is when the smoker usually\nhas a cigarette). For both the crack user and the cigarette smoker, the cues associated with\nthe drug may actually cause craving that is alleviated by (you guessed it) \u2013 lighting a cigarette\nor using crack (i.e., relapse). This is one of the reasons individuals that enroll in drug treatment\nprograms, especially out-of-town programs, are at significant risk of relapse if they later find\nthemselves in proximity to old haunts, friends, etc. But this is much more difficult for a cigarette\nsmoker. How can someone avoid eating? Or avoid waking up in the morning, etc. These\nexamples help you begin to understand how important the route of administration can be\nfor psychoactive drugs.\nDrug Metabolism\nMetabolism involves the breakdown of psychoactive drugs, and this occurs primarily in the\nliver. The liver produces enzymes (proteins that speed up a chemical reaction), and these\nenzymes help catalyze a chemical reaction that breaks down psychoactive drugs. Enzymes\nexist in \u201cfamilies,\u201d and many psychoactive drugs are broken down by the same family of\nenzymes, the cytochrome P450 superfamily. There is not a unique enzyme for each drug; Psychopharmacology 490\nrather, certain enzymes can break down a wide variety of drugs. Tolerance to the effects of\nmany drugs can occur with repeated exposure; that is, the drug produces less of an effect\nover time, so more of the drug is needed to get the same effect. This is particularly true for\nsedative drugs like alcohol or opiate-based painkillers. Metabolic tolerance is one kind of\ntolerance and it takes place in the liver. Some drugs (like alcohol) cause enzyme induction \u2013\nan increase in the enzymes produced by the liver. For example, chronic drinking results in\nalcohol being broken down more quickly, so the alcoholic needs to drink more to get the same\neffect \u2013 of course, until so much alcohol is consumed that it damages the liver (alcohol can\ncause fatty liver or cirrhosis).\nRecent Issues Related to Psychotropic Drugs and Metabolism\nGrapefruit Juice and Metabolism\nCertain types of food in the stomach can alter the\nrate of drug absorption, and other foods can also\nalter the rate of drug metabolism. The most well\nknown is grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice\nsuppresses cytochrome P450 enzymes in the\nliver, and these liver enzymes normally break\ndown a large variety of drugs (including some of\nthe psychotropic drugs). If the enzymes are\nsuppressed, drug levels can build up to\npotentially toxic levels. In this case, the effects\ncan persist for extended periods of time after the\nconsumption of grapefruit juice. As of 2013, there\nare at least 85 drugs shown to adversely interact\nwith grapefruit juice (Bailey, Dresser, & Arnold,\nGrapefruit can interfere with enzymes in the liver that\nhelp the body to process certain drugs. [Photo: 2013). Some psychotropic drugs that are likely\nwoodleywonderworks] to interact with grapefruit juice include\ncarbamazepine (Tegretol), prescribed for bipolar\ndisorder; diazepam (Valium), used to treat anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, and muscle spasms;\nand fluvoxamine (Luvox), used to treat obsessive compulsive disorder and depression. A link\nat the end of this module gives the latest list of drugs reported to have this unusual interaction.\nIndividualized Therapy, Metabolic Differences, and Potential Prescribing\nApproaches for the Future Psychopharmacology 491\nMental illnesses contribute to more disability in western countries than all other illnesses\nincluding cancer and heart disease. Depression alone is predicted to be the second largest\ncontributor to disease burden by 2020 (World Health Organization, 2004). The numbers of\npeople affected by mental health issues are pretty astonishing, with estimates that 25% of\nadults experience a mental health issue in any given year, and this affects not only the\nindividual but their friends and family. One in 17 adults experiences a serious mental illness\n(Kessler, Chiu, Demler, & Walters, 2005). Newer antidepressants are probably the most\nfrequently prescribed drugs for treating mental health issues, although there is no \u201cmagic\nbullet\u201d for treating depression or other conditions. Pharmacotherapy with psychological\ntherapy may be the most beneficial treatment approach for many psychiatric conditions, but\nthere are still many unanswered questions. For example, why does one antidepressant help\none individual yet have no effect for another? Antidepressants can take 4 to 6 weeks to start\nimproving depressive symptoms, and we don\u2019t really understand why. Many people do not\nrespond to the first antidepressant prescribed and may have to try different drugs before\nfinding something that works for them. Other people just do not improve with antidepressants\n(Ioannidis, 2008). As we better understand why individuals differ, the easier and more rapidly\nwe will be able to help people in distress.\nOne area that has received interest recently has to do with an individualized treatment\napproach. We now know that there are genetic differences in some of the cytochrome P450\nenzymes and their ability to break down drugs. The general population falls into the following\n4 categories: 1) ultra-extensive metabolizers break down certain drugs (like some of the current\nantidepressants) very, very quickly, 2) extensive metabolizers are also able to break down drugs\nfairly quickly, 3) intermediate metabolizers break down drugs more slowly than either of the\ntwo above groups, and finally 4) poor metabolizers break down drugs much more slowly than\nall of the other groups. Now consider someone receiving a prescription for an antidepressant \u2013\nwhat would the consequences be if they were either an ultra-extensive metabolizer or a poor\nmetabolizer? The ultra-extensive metabolizer would be given antidepressants and told it will\nprobably take 4 to 6 weeks to begin working (this is true), but they metabolize the medication\nso quickly that it will never be effective for them. In contrast, the poor metabolizer given the\nsame daily dose of the same antidepressant may build up such high levels in their blood\n(because they are not breaking the drug down), that they will have a wide range of side effects\nand feel really badly \u2013 also not a positive outcome. What if \u2013 instead \u2013 prior to prescribing an\nantidepressant, the doctor could take a blood sample and determine which type of\nmetabolizer a patient actually was? They could then make a much more informed decision\nabout the best dose to prescribe. There are new genetic tests now available to better\nindividualize treatment in just this way. A blood sample can determine (at least for some\ndrugs) which category an individual fits into, but we need data to determine if this actually is\neffective for treating depression or other mental illnesses (Zhou, 2009). Currently, this genetic Psychopharmacology 492\ntest is expensive and not many health insurance plans cover this screen, but this may be an\nimportant component in the future of psychopharmacology.\nOther Controversial Issues\nJuveniles and Psychopharmacology\nA recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report has suggested that as many as 1 in 5 children\nbetween the ages of 5 and 17 may have some type of mental disorder (e.g., ADHD, autism,\nanxiety, depression) (CDC, 2013). The incidence of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents\nhas also increased 40 times in the past decade (Moreno, Laje, Blanco, Jiang, Schmidt, & Olfson,\n2007), and it is now estimated that 1 in 88 children have been diagnosed with an autism\nspectrum disorder (CDC, 2011). Why has there been such an increase in these numbers?\nThere is no single answer to this important question. Some believe that greater public\nawareness has contributed to increased teacher and parent referrals. Others argue that the\nincrease stems from changes in criterion currently used for diagnosing. Still others suggest\nenvironmental factors, either prenatally or postnatally, have contributed to this upsurge.\nWe do not have an answer, but the question does\nbring up an additional controversy related to how\nwe should treat this population of children and\nadolescents. Many psychotropic drugs used for\ntreating psychiatric disorders have been tested in\nadults, but few have been tested for safety or\nefficacy with children or adolescents. The most well-\nestablished psychotropics prescribed for children\nand adolescents are the psychostimulant drugs\nused for treating attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD), and there are clinical data on how\neffective these drugs are. However, we know far less\nabout the safety and efficacy in young populations\nof the drugs typically prescribed for treating anxiety,\ndepression, or other psychiatric disorders. The\nyoung brain continues to mature until probably well\nafter age 20, so some scientists are concerned that\ndrugs that alter neuronal activity in the developing\nThere are concerns about both the safety and\nbrain could have significant consequences. There efficacy of drugs like Prozac for children and teens.\nis an obvious need for clinical trials in children and [Photo:zaza_bj] Psychopharmacology 493\nadolescents to test the safety and effectiveness of many of these drugs, which also brings up\na variety of ethical questions about who decides what children and adolescents will participate\nin these clinical trials, who can give consent, who receives reimbursements, etc.\nThe Elderly and Psychopharmacology\nAnother population that has not typically been included in clinical trials to determine the\nsafety or effectiveness of psychotropic drugs is the elderly. Currently, there is very little high-\nquality evidence to guide prescribing for older people \u2013 clinical trials often exclude people\nwith multiple comorbidities (other diseases, conditions, etc.), which are typical for elderly\npopulations (see Hilmer and Gnjidict, 2008; Pollock, Forsyth, & Bies, 2008). This is a serious\nissue because the elderly consume a disproportionate number of the prescription meds\nprescribed. The term polypharmacy refers to the use of multiple drugs, which is very common\nin elderly populations in the United States. As our population ages, some estimate that the\nproportion of people 65 or older will reach 20% of the U.S. population by 2030, with this group\nconsuming 40% of the prescribed medications. As shown in Table 3 (from Schwartz and\nAbernethy, 2008), it is quite clear why the typical clinical trial that looks at the safety and\neffectiveness of psychotropic drugs can be problematic if we try to interpret these results for\nan elderly population.\nTable 3. Characteristics if clinical trial subjects vs. actual patients. (Reprinted by permission\nfrom Schwartz & Abernethy, 2008.) Psychopharmacology 494\nMetabolism of drugs is often slowed considerably for elderly populations, so less drug can\nproduce the same effect (or all too often, too much drug can result in a variety of side effects).\nOne of the greatest risk factors for elderly populations is falling (and breaking bones), which\ncan happen if the elderly person gets dizzy from too much of a drug. There is also evidence\nthat psychotropic medications can reduce bone density (thus worsening the consequences\nif someone falls) (Brown & Mezuk, 2012). Although we are gaining an awareness about some\nof the issues facing pharmacotherapy in older populations, this is a very complex area with\nmany medical and ethical questions.\nThis module provided an introduction of some of the important areas in the field of\npsychopharmacology. It should be apparent that this module just touched on a number of\ntopics included in this field. It should also be apparent that understanding more about\npsychopharmacology is important to anyone interested in understanding behavior and that\nour understanding of issues in this field has important implications for society.

Fiske\nPeople are often biased against others outside of their own social group, showing prejudice\n(emotional bias), stereotypes (cognitive bias), and discrimination (behavioral bias). In the past,\npeople used to be more explicit with their biases, but during the 20th century, when it became\nless socially acceptable to exhibit bias, such things like prejudice, stereotypes, and\ndiscrimination became more subtle (automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent). In the 21st\ncentury, however, with social group categories even more complex, biases may be\ntransforming once again.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Distinguish prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination.\n\u2022 Distinguish old-fashioned, blatant biases from contemporary, subtle biases.\n\u2022 Understand old-fashioned biases such as social dominance orientation and right-wing.\nauthoritarianism.\n\u2022 Understand subtle, unexamined biases that are automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent.\n\u2022 Understand 21st century biases that may break down as identities get more complicated.\nIntroduction\nEven in one\u2019s own family, everyone wants to be seen for who they are, not as \u201cjust another Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 501\ntypical X.\u201d But still, people put\nother people into groups, using\nthat label to inform their\nevaluation of the person as a\nwhole\u2014a process that can result\nin serious consequences. This\nmodule focuses on biases against\nsocial groups, which social psych\u00ad\nologists sort into emotional\nprejudices, mental stereotypes,\nand behavioral discrimination.\nThese three aspects of bias are\nrelated, but they each can occur\nYou are a complex individual, full of different dreams, beliefs, identities, and\nseparately from the others\nmore that help make you unique.

[Photo: leg0fenris] reaction to a social group\n(prejudice) without knowing even\nthe most superficial reasons to dislike them (stereotypes).\nThis module shows that today\u2019s biases are not yesterday\u2019s biases in many ways, but at the\nsame time, they are troublingly similar. First, we\u2019ll discuss old-fashioned biases that might\nhave belonged to our grandparents and great-grandparents\u2014or even the people nowadays\nwho have yet to leave those wrongful times. Next, we will discuss late 20th century biases\nthat affected our parents and still linger today. Finally, we will talk about today\u2019s 21st century\nbiases that challenge fairness and respect for all.\nOld-fashioned Biases: Almost Gone\nYou would be hard pressed to find someone today who openly admits they don\u2019t believe in\nequality. Regardless of one\u2019s demographics, most people believe everyone is entitled to the\nsame, natural rights. However, as much as we now collectively believe this, not too far back\nin our history, this ideal of equality was an unpracticed sentiment. Of all the countries in the\nworld, only a few have equality in their constitution, and those who do, originally defined it\nfor a select group of people.\nAt the time, old-fashioned biases were simple: people openly put down those not from their Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 502\nown group. For example, just 80 years ago, American college students unabashedly thought\nTurkish people were \u201ccruel, very religious, and treacherous\u201d (Katz & Braly, 1933). So where did\nthey get those ideas, assuming that most of them had never met anyone from Turkey? Old-\nfashioned stereotypes were overt, unapologetic, and expected to be shared by others\u2014what\nwe now call \u201cblatant biases.\u201d\nBlatant biases are conscious beliefs, feelings, and behavior that people are perfectly willing\nto admit, which mostly express hostility toward other groups (outgroups) while unduly favoring\none\u2019s own group (in-group). For example, organizations that preach contempt for other races\n(and praise for their own) is an example of a blatant bias. And scarily, these blatant biases\ntend to run in packs: People who openly hate one outgroup also hate many others. To illustrate\nthis pattern, we turn to two personality scales next.\nSocial Dominance Orientation\nSocial dominance orientation (SDO)\ndescribes a belief that group hierarchies are\ninevitable in all societies and are even a good\nidea to maintain order and stability\n(Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Those who score\nhigh on SDO believe that some groups are\ninherently better than others, and because\nof this, there is no such thing as group\n\u201cequality.\u201d At the same time, though, SDO is\nnot just about being personally dominant\nand controlling of others; SDO describes a\npreferred arrangement of groups with some\non top (preferably one\u2019s own group) and\nsome on the bottom. For example, someone\nhigh in SDO would likely be upset if someone\nPeople with a social dominance orientation are more likely to\nfrom an outgroup moved into his or her\nbe attracted to certain types of careers, such as law\nneighborhood. It\u2019s not that the person high\nenforcement, that maintain group hierarchies. [Photo:\nin SDO wants to \u201ccontrol\u201d what this outgroup canonsnapper]\nmember does; it\u2019s that moving into this \u201cnice\nneighborhood\u201d disrupts the social hierarchy the person high in SDO believes in (i.e. living in\na nice neighborhood denotes one\u2019s place in the social hierarchy\u2014a place reserved for one\u2019s\nin-group members). Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 503\nAlthough research has shown that people higher in SDO are more likely to be politically\nconservative, there are other traits that more strongly predict one\u2019s SDO. For example,\nresearchers have found that those who score higher on SDO are usually lower than average\non tolerance, empathy, altruism, and community orientation. In general, those high in SDO\nhave a strong belief in work ethic\u2014that hard work always pays off and leisure is a waste of\ntime. People higher on SDO tend to choose and thrive in occupations that maintain existing\ngroup hierarchies (police, prosecutors, business), compared to those lower in SDO, who tend\nto pick more equalizing occupations (social work, public defense, psychology).\nThe point is that SDO\u2014a preference for inequality as normal and natural\u2014also predicts\nendorsing the superiority of certain groups: men, native-born residents, heterosexuals, and\nbelievers in the dominant religion. This means seeing women, minorities, homosexuals, and\nnon-believers as inferior. Understandably, the first list of groups tend to score higher on SDO,\nwhile the second group tends to score lower. For example, the SDO gender difference (men\nhigher, women lower) appears all over the world.\nAt its heart, SDO rests on a fundamental belief that the world is tough and competitive with\nonly a limited number of resources. Thus, those high in SDO see groups as battling each other\nfor these resources, with winners at the top of the social hierarchy and losers at the bottom\n(see Table 1).\nTable 1. Old-Fashioned Biases\nRight-wing Authoritarianism\nRight-wing authoritarianism (RWA) focuses on value conflicts, whereas SDO focuses on the\neconomic ones. That is, RWA endorses respect for obedience and authority in the service of\ngroup conformity (Altemeyer, 1988). Returning to an example from earlier, the homeowner Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 504\nwho\u2019s high in SDO may dislike the outgroup member moving into his or her neighborhood\nbecause it \u201cthreatens\u201d one\u2019s economic resources (e.g. lowering the value of one\u2019s house; fewer\nopenings in the school; etc.). Those high in RWA may equally dislike the outgroup member\nmoving into the neighborhood but for different reasons. Here, it\u2019s because this outgroup\nmember brings in values or beliefs that the person high in RWA disagrees with, thus\n\u201cthreatening\u201d the collective values of his or her group. RWA respects group unity over individual\npreferences, wanting to maintain group values in the face of differing opinions. Despite its\nname, though, RWA is not necessarily limited to people on the right (conservatives). Like SDO,\nthere does appear to be an association between this personality scale (i.e. the preference for\norder, clarity, and conventional values) and conservative beliefs. However, regardless of\npolitical ideology, RWA focuses on groups\u2019 competing frameworks of values. Extreme scores\non RWA predict biases against outgroups while demanding in-group loyalty and conformity\nNotably, the combination of high RWA and high SDO predicts joining hate groups that openly\nendorse aggression against minority groups, immigrants, homosexuals, and believers in non-\ndominant religions (Altemeyer, 2004).\n20th Century Biases: Subtle but Significant\nFortunately, old-fashioned biases\nhave diminished over the 20th\ncentury and into the 21st century.\nOpenly expressing prejudice is like\nblowing second-hand cigarette\nsmoke in someone\u2019s face: It\u2019s just\nnot done any more in most circles,\nand if it is, people are readily\ncriticized for their behavior. Still,\nthese biases exist in people; they\u2019re\njust less in view than before. These\nsubtle biases are unexamined and\nsometimes unconscious but real in\ntheir consequences. They are\nautomatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent,\nbut nonetheless biased, unfair, and\nAn actual screenshot from an IAT (Implicit Association Test) that is designed disrespectful to the belief in\nto test a person\u2019s reaction time (measured in milliseconds) to an array of\nequality.\nstimuli that are presented on the screen. This particular item is testing an\nindividual\u2019s unconscious reaction towards members of various ethnic\nAutomatic Biases\ngroups. [Image: Courtesy of Anthony Greenwald from Project Implicit] Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 505\nMost people like themselves well enough, and most people identify themselves as members\nof certain groups but not others. Logic suggests, then, that because we like ourselves, we\ntherefore like the groups we associate with more, whether those groups are our hometown,\nschool, religion, gender, or ethnicity. Liking yourself and your groups is human nature. The\nlarger issue, however, is that own-group preference often results in liking other groups less.\nAnd whether you recognize this \u201cfavoritism\u201d as wrong, this trade-off is relatively automatic,\nthat is, unintended, immediate, and irresistible.\nSocial psychologists have developed several ways to measure this relatively automatic own-\ngroup preference, the most famous being the Implicit Association Test (IAT;Greenwald, Banaji,\nRudman, Farnham, Nosek, & Mellott, 2002; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). The test\nitself is rather simple and you can experience it yourself if you Google \u201cimplicit\u201d or go\nto understandingprejudice.org. Essentially, the IAT is done on the computer and measures how\nquickly you can sort words or pictures into different categories. For example, if you were asked\nto categorize \u201cice cream\u201d as good or bad, you would quickly categorize it as good. However,\nimagine if every time you ate ice cream, you got a brain freeze. When it comes time to categorize\nice cream as good or bad, you may still categorize it as \u201cgood,\u201d but you will likely be a little\nslower in doing so compared to someone who has nothing but positive thoughts about ice\ncream. Related to group biases, people may explicitly claim they don\u2019t discriminate against\noutgroups\u2014and this is very likely true. However, when they\u2019re given this computer task to\ncategorize people from these outgroups, that automatic or unconscious hesitation (a result\nof having mixed evaluations about the outgroup) will show up in the test. And as countless\nstudies have revealed, people are mostly faster at pairing their own group with good\ncategories, compared to pairing others\u2019 groups. In fact, this finding generally holds regardless\nif one\u2019s group is measured according race, age, religion, nationality, and even temporary,\ninsignificant memberships.\nThis all-too-human tendency would remain a mere interesting discovery except that people\u2019s\nreaction time on the IAT predicts actual feelings about individuals from other groups, decisions\nabout them, and behavior toward them, especially nonverbal behavior (Greenwald, Poehlman,\nUhlmann, & Banaji, 2009). For example, although a job interviewer may not be \u201cblatantly\nbiased,\u201d his or her \u201cautomatic or implicit biases\u201d may result in unconsciously acting distant\nand indifferent, which can have devastating effects on the hopeful interviewee\u2019s ability to\nperform well (Word, Zanna, & Cooper, 1973). Although this is unfair, sometimes the automatic\nassociations\u2014often driven by society\u2019s stereotypes\u2014trump our own, explicit values (Devine,\n1989). And sadly, this can result in consequential discrimination, such as allocating fewer\nresources to disliked outgroups (Rudman & Ashmore, 2009). See Table 2 for a summary of\nthis section and the next two sections on subtle biases. Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 506\nTable 2: Subtle Biases\nAmbiguous Biases\nAs the IAT indicates, people\u2019s biases often stem\nfrom the spontaneous tendency to favor their own,\nat the expense of the other. Social identity theory\n(Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, & Flament, 1971) describes\nthis tendency to favor one\u2019s own in-group over\nanother\u2019s outgroup. And as a result, outgroup\ndisliking stems from this in-group liking (Brewer &\nBrown, 1998). For example, if two classes of\nchildren want to play on the same soccer field, the\nclasses will come to dislike each other not because\nof any real, objectionable traits about the other\ngroup. The dislike originates from each class\u2019s\nfavoritism toward itself and the fact that only one\ngroup can play on the soccer field at a time. With\nthis preferential perspective for one\u2019s own group,\npeople are not punishing the other one so much\nas neglecting it in favor of their own. However, to\njustify this preferential treatment, people will often\nexaggerate the differences between their in-group\nand the outgroup. In turn, people see the outgroup\nas more similar in personality than they are. This\nWhether we are aware of it or not (and usually we're\nnot), we sort the world into \"us\" and \"them\" results in the perception that \u201cthey\u201d really differ\ncategories. We are more likely to treat with bias or from us, and \u201cthey\u201d are all alike. Spontaneously,\ndiscrimination anyone we feel is outside our own\npeople categorize people into groups just as we\ngroup. [Photo: id-iom]\ncategorize furniture or food into one type or Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 507\nanother. The difference is that we people inhabit categories ourselves, as self-categorization\ntheory points out (Turner, 1975). Because the attributes of group categories can be either\ngood or bad, we tend to favor the groups with people like us and incidentally disfavor the\nothers. In-group favoritism is an ambiguous form of bias because it disfavors the outgroup\nby exclusion. For example, if a politician has to decide between funding one program or\nanother, s/he may be more likely to give resources to the group that more closely represents\nhis in-group. And this life-changing decision stems from the simple, natural human tendency\nto be more comfortable with people like yourself.\nA specific case of comfort with the ingroup is called aversive racism, so-called because people\ndo not like to admit their own racial biases to themselves or others (Dovidio & Gaertner, 2010).\nTensions between, say, a White person\u2019s own good intentions and discomfort with the perhaps\nnovel situation of interacting closely with a Black person may cause the White person to feel\nuneasy, behave stiffly, or be distracted. As a result, the White person may give a good excuse\nto avoid the situation altogether and prevent any awkwardness that could have come from\nit. However, such a reaction will be ambiguous to both parties and hard to interpret. That is,\nwas the White person right to avoid the situation so that neither person would feel\nuncomfortable? Indicators of aversive racism correlate with discriminatory behavior, despite\nbeing the ambiguous result of good intentions gone bad.\nBias Can Be Complicated - Ambivalent Biases\nNot all stereotypes of outgroups are all bad. For example, ethnic Asians living in the United\nStates are commonly referred to as the \u201cmodel minority\u201d because of their perceived success\nin areas such as education, income, and social stability. Another example includes people\nwho feel benevolent toward traditional women but hostile toward nontraditional women. Or\neven ageist people who feel respect toward older adults but, at the same time, worry about\nthe burden they place on public welfare programs. A simple way to understand these mixed\nfeelings, across a variety of groups, results from the Stereotype Content Model (Fiske, Cuddy,\n& Glick, 2007).\nWhen people learn about a new group, they first want to know if its intentions of the people\nin this group are for good or ill. Like the guard at night: \u201cWho goes there, friend or foe?\u201d If the\nother group has good, cooperative intentions, we view them as warm and trustworthy and\noften consider them part of \u201cour side.\u201d However, if the other group is cold and competitive or\nfull of exploiters, we often view them as a threat and treat them accordingly. After learning\nthe group\u2019s intentions, though, we also want to know whether they are competent enough to\nact on them (if they are incompetent, or unable, their intentions matter less). These two simple Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 508\ndimensions\u2014warmth and competence\u2014together map how groups relate to each other in\nsociety.\nFigure 1: Stereotype Content Model - 4 kinds of stereotypes that\nform from perceptions of competence and warmth\nThere are common stereotypes of people from all sorts of categories and occupations that\nlead them to be classified along these two dimensions. For example, a stereotypical\n\u201chousewife\u201d would be seen as high in warmth but lower in competence. This is not to suggest\nthat actual housewives are not competent, of course, but that they are not widely admired\nfor their competence in the same way as scientific pioneers, trendsetters, or captains of\nindustry. At another end of the spectrum are homeless people and drug addicts, stereotyped\nas not having good intentions (perhaps exploitative for not trying to play by the rules), and\nlikewise being incompetent (unable) to do anything useful. These groups reportedly make\nsociety more disgusted than any other groups do.\nSome group stereotypes are mixed, high on one dimension and low on the other. Groups\nstereotyped as competent but not warm, for example, include rich people and outsiders good\nat business. These groups that are seen as \u201ccompetent but cold\u201d make people feel some envy,\nadmitting that these others may have some talent but resenting them for not being \u201cpeople\nlike us.\u201d The \u201cmodel minority\u201d stereotype mentioned earlier includes people with this excessive\ncompetence but deficient sociability. Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 509\nThe other mixed combination is high warmth but low competence. Groups who fit this\ncombination include older people and disabled people. Others report pitying them, but only\nso long as they stay in their place. In an effort to combat this negative stereotype, disability-\nand elderly-rights activists try to eliminate that pity, hopefully gaining respect in the process.\nAltogether, these four kinds of stereotypes and their associated emotional prejudices (pride,\ndisgust, envy, pity) occur all over the world for each of society\u2019s own groups. These maps of\nthe group terrain predict specific types of discrimination for specific kinds of groups,\nunderlining how bias is not exactly equal opportunity.\nFigure 2: Combinations of perceived warmth and confidence and\nthe associated behaviors/emotional prejudices.\nConclusion: 21st Century Prejudices\nAs the world becomes more interconnected\u2014more collaborations between countries, more\nintermarrying between different groups\u2014more and more people are encountering greater\ndiversity of others in everyday life. Just ask yourself if you\u2019ve ever been asked, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\nSuch a question would be preposterous if you were only surrounded by members of your\nown group. Categories, then, are becoming more and more uncertain, unclear, volatile, and\ncomplex (Bodenhausen & Peery, 2009). People\u2019s identities are multifaceted, intersecting\nacross gender, race, class, age, region, and more. Identities are not so simple, but maybe as Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 510\nthe 21st century unfurls, we will recognize each other by the content of our character instead\nof the cover on our outside.

Levine\nThis module introduces several major principles in the process of persuasion. It offers an\noverview of the different paths to persuasion. It then describes how mindless processing\nmakes us vulnerable to undesirable persuasion and some of the \u201ctricks\u201d that may be used\nagainst us.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Recognize the difference between the central and peripheral routes to persuasion.\n\u2022 Understand the concepts of trigger features, fixed action patterns, heuristics, and mindless\nthinking, and how these processes are essential to our survival but, at the same time, leave\nus vulnerable to exploitation.\n\u2022 Understand some common \u201ctricks\u201d persuasion artists may use to take advantage of us.\n\u2022 Use this knowledge to make you less susceptible to unwanted persuasion.\nIntroduction\nHave you ever tried to swap seats with a stranger on an airline? Ever negotiated the price of\na car? Ever tried to convince someone to recycle, quit smoking, or make a similar change in\nhealth behaviors? If so, you are well versed with how persuasion can show up in everyday life.\nPersuasion has been defined as \u201cthe process by which a message induces change in beliefs,\nattitudes, or behaviors\u201d (Myers, 2011). Persuasion can take many forms. It may, for example, Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 517\ndiffer in whether it targets public compliance or private acceptance, is short-term or long-\nterm, whether it involves slowly escalating commitments or sudden interventions and, most\nof all, in the benevolence of its intentions. When persuasion is well-meaning, we might call it\neducation. When it is manipulative, it might be called mind control (Levine, 2003).\nWhatever the content, however, there\nis a similarity to the form of the\npersuasion process itself. As the\nadvertising commentator Sid Bernstein\nonce observed, \u201cOf course, you sell\ncandidates for political office the same\nway you sell soap or sealing wax or\nwhatever; because, when you get right\ndown to it, that\u2019s the only way anything\nis sold\u201d (Levine, 2003).\nPersuasion is one of the most studied\nof all social psychology phenomena.\nThe instruments of persuasion work the same for selling products or\nThis module provides an introduction\npoliticians. [Image: Brian]\nto several of its most important\ncomponents.\nTwo Paths to Persuasion\nPersuasion theorists distinguish between the central and peripheral routes to persuasion\n(Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). The central route employs direct, relevant, logical messages. This\nmethod rests on the assumption that the audience is motivated, will think carefully about\nwhat is presented, and will react on the basis of your arguments. The central route is intended\nto produce enduring agreement. For example, you might decide to vote for a particular political\ncandidate after hearing her speak and finding her logic and proposed policies to be convincing.\nThe peripheral route, on the other hand, relies on superficial cues that have little to do with\nlogic. The peripheral approach is the salesman\u2019s way of thinking. It requires a target who isn\u2019t\nthinking carefully about what you are saying. It requires low effort from the target and often\nexploits rule-of-thumb heuristics that trigger mindless reactions (see below). It may be\nintended to persuade you to do something you do not want to do and might later be sorry\nyou did. Advertisements, for example, may show celebrities, cute animals, beautiful scenery,\nor provocative sexual images that have nothing to do with the product. The peripheral Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 518\napproach is also common in the darkest of persuasion programs, such as those of dictators\nand cult leaders. Returning to the example of voting, you can experience the peripheral route\nin action when you see a provocative, emotionally charged political advertisement that tugs\nat you to vote a particular way.\nTriggers and Fixed Action Patterns\nThe central route emphasizes objective communication of information. The peripheral route\nrelies on psychological techniques. These techniques may take advantage of a target\u2019s not\nthinking carefully about the message. The process mirrors a phenomenon in animal behavior\nknown as fixed action patterns (FAPs). These are sequences of behavior that occur in exactly\nthe same fashion, in exactly the same order, every time they\u2019re elicited. Cialdini (2008)\ncompares it to a prerecorded tape that is turned on and, once it is, always plays to its finish.\nHe describes it is as if the animal were turning on a tape recorder (Cialdini, 2008). There is the\nfeeding tape, the territorial tape, the migration tape, the nesting tape, the aggressive tape\u2014\neach sequence ready to be played when a situation calls for it.\nIn humans fixed action patterns include many of the activities we engage in while mentally\non \"auto-pilot.\" These behaviors are so automatic that it is very difficult to control them. If\nyou ever feed a baby, for instance, nearly everyone mimics each bite the baby takes by opening\nand closing their own mouth! If two people near you look up and point you will automatically\nlook up yourself. We also operate in a reflexive, non-thinking way when we make many\ndecisions. We are more likely, for example, to be less critical about medical advice dispensed\nfrom a doctor than from a friend who read an interesting article on the topic in a popular\nmagazine.\nA notable characteristic of fixed action patterns is how they are activated. At first glance, it\nappears the animal is responding to the overall situation. For example, the maternal tape\nappears to be set off when a mother sees her hungry baby, or the aggressive tape seems to\nbe activated when an enemy invades the animal\u2019s territory. It turns out, however, that the on/\noff switch may actually be controlled by a specific, minute detail of the situation\u2014maybe a\nsound or shape or patch of color. These are the hot buttons of the biological world\u2014what\nCialdini refers to as \u201ctrigger features\u201d and biologists call \u201creleasers.\u201d\nHumans are not so different. Take the example of a study conducted on various ways to\npromote a campus bake sale for charity (Levine, 2003). Simply displaying the cookies and\nother treats to passersby did not generate many sales (only 2 out of 30 potential customers\nmade a purchase). In an alternate condition, however, when potential customers were asked Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 519\nto \"buy a cookie for a good cause\" the\nnumber rose to 12 out of 30. It seems\nthat the phrase \"a good cause\"\ntriggered a willingness to act. In fact,\nwhen the phrase \"a good cause\" was\npaired with a locally-recognized\ncharity (known for its food-for-the-\nhomeless program) the numbers held\nsteady at 14 out of 30. When a fictional\ngood cause was used instead (the\nmake believe \"Levine House\") still 11\nout of 30 potential customers made\nCertain triggers can cause people to switch into an automatic pattern purchases and not one asked about\nof behavior. In an experiment, potential customers were more easily\nthe purpose or nature of the cause.\npersuaded to buy when they heard the words \"for a good cause.\" [Photo:\nThe phrase \"for a good cause\" was an\nAlameda County Library]\ninfluential enough hot button that the\nexact cause didn't seem to matter.\nThe effectiveness of peripheral persuasion relies on our frequent reliance on these sorts of\nfixed action patterns and trigger features. These mindless, rules-of-thumb are generally\neffective shortcuts for coping with the overload of information we all must confront. They\nserve as heuristics\u2014mental shortcuts-- that enable us to make decisions and solve problems\nquickly and efficiently. They also, however, make us vulnerable to uninvited exploitation\nthrough the peripheral route of persuasion.\nThe Source of Persuasion: The Triad of Trustworthiness\nEffective persuasion re\u00ad\nquires trusting the source\nof the communication.\nStudies have identified\nthree characteristics that\nlead to trust: perceived\nauthority, honesty, and\nlikability.\nWhen the source appears\nto have any or all of Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 520\nthese characteristics, people not only are more willing to agree to their request but are willing\nto do so without carefully considering the facts. We assume we are on safe ground and are\nhappy to shortcut the tedious process of informed decision making. As a result, we are more\nsusceptible to messages and requests, no matter their particular content or how peripheral\nthey may be.\nAuthority\nFrom earliest childhood, we learn to rely on authority figures for sound decision making\nbecause their authority signifies status and power, as well as expertise. These two facets often\nwork together. Authorities such as parents and teachers are not only our primary sources of\nwisdom while we grow up, but they control us and our access to the things we want. In\naddition, we have been taught to believe that respect for authority is a moral virtue. As adults,\nit is natural to transfer this respect to society\u2019s designated authorities, such as judges, doctors,\nbosses, and religious leaders. We assume their positions give them special access to\ninformation and power. Usually we are correct, so that our willingness to defer to authorities\nbecomes a convenient shortcut to sound decision making. Uncritical trust in authority may,\nhowever, lead to bad decisions. Perhaps the most famous study ever conducted in social\npsychology demonstrated that, when conditions were set up just so, two-thirds of a sample\nof psychologically normal men were willing to administer potentially lethal shocks to a stranger\nwhen an apparent authority in a laboratory coat ordered them to do so (Milgram, 1974; Burger,\n2009).\nUncritical trust in authority can be problematic for several reasons. First, even if the source\nof the message is a legitimate, well-intentioned authority, they may not always be correct.\nSecond, when respect for authority becomes mindless, expertise in one domain may be\nconfused with expertise in general. To assume there is credibility when a successful actor\npromotes a cold remedy, or when a psychology professor offers his views about politics, can\nlead to problems. Third, the authority may not be legitimate. It is not difficult to fake a college\ndegree or professional credential or to buy an official-looking badge or uniform.\nHonesty\nHonesty is the moral dimension of trustworthiness. Persuasion professionals have long\nunderstood how critical it is to their efforts. Marketers, for example, dedicate exorbitant\nresources to developing and maintaining an image of honesty. A trusted brand or company\nname becomes a mental shortcut for consumers. It is estimated that some 50,000 new\nproducts come out each year. Forrester Research, a marketing research company, calculates Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 521\nthat children have seen almost six million ads by the age of 16. An established brand name\nhelps us cut through this volume of information. It signals we are in safe territory. \u201cThe real\nsuggestion to convey,\u201d advertising leader Theodore MacManus observed in 1910, \u201cis that the\nman manufacturing the product is an honest man, and the product is an honest product, to\nbe preferred above all others\u201d (Fox, 1997).\nLikability\nIf we know that celebrities aren\u2019t really experts, and that\nthey are being paid to say what they\u2019re saying, why do their\nendorsements sell so many products? Ultimately, it is\nbecause we like them. More than any single quality, we\ntrust people we like. Roger Ailes, a public relations adviser\nto Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, observed: \u201cIf\nyou could master one element of personal communication\nthat is more powerful than anything . . . it is the quality of\nbeing likeable. I call it the magic bullet, because if your\naudience likes you, they\u2019ll forgive just about everything else\nyou do wrong. If they don\u2019t like you, you can hit every rule\nright on target and it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nThe mix of qualities that make a person likable are complex\nand often do not generalize from one situation to another.\nPeople tend to favor products that are\nOne clear finding, however, is that physically attractive\nassociated with people they like. This is the\npeople tend to be liked more. In fact, we prefer them to a\nkey ingredient to celebrity endorsements.\nWhile there are a lot of factors that can disturbing extent: Various studies have shown we perceive\ncontribute to likability, being physically attractive people as smarter, kinder, stronger, more\nattractive is right at the top of the list in\nsuccessful, more socially skilled, better poised, better\nterms of importance. [Photo: Georges\nadjusted, more exciting, more nurturing, and, most\nBiard]\nimportant, of higher moral character. All of this is based\non no other information than their physical appearance (e.g., Dion, Berscheid, & Walster,\n1972).\nManipulating the Perception of Trustworthiness\nThe perception of trustworthiness is highly susceptible to manipulation. Levine (2003) lists\nsome of the most common psychological strategies that are used to achieve this effect: Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 522\nTestimonials and Endorsement\nThis technique employs someone who people already trust to testify about the product or\nmessage being sold. The technique goes back to the earliest days of advertising when satisfied\ncustomers might be shown describing how a patent medicine cured their life-long battle with\n\u201cnerves\u201d or how Dr. Scott\u2019s Electric Hair Brush healed their baldness (\u201cMy hair (was) falling out,\nand I was rapidly becoming bald, but since using the brush a thick growth of hair has made\nits appearance, quite equal to that I had before previous to its falling out,\u201d reported a satisfied\ncustomer in an 1884 ad for the product). Similarly, Kodak had Prince Henri D\u2019Orleans and\nothers endorse the superior quality of their camera (\u201cThe results are marvellous[sic]. The\nenlargements which you sent me are superb,\u201c stated Prince Henri D\u2019Orleans in a 1888 ad).\nCelebrity endorsements are a frequent feature in commercials aimed at children. The practice\nhas aroused considerable ethical concern, and research shows the concern is warranted. In\na study funded by the Federal Trade Commission, more than 400 children ages 8 to 14 were\nshown one of various commercials for a model racing set. Some of the commercials featured\nan endorsement from a famous race car driver, some included real racing footage, and others\nincluded neither. Children who watched the celebrity endorser not only preferred the toy cars\nmore but were convinced the endorser was an expert about the toys. This held true for children\nof all ages. In addition, they believed the toy race cars were bigger, faster, and more complex\nthan real race cars they saw on film. They were also less likely to believe the commercial was\nstaged (Ross et al., 1984).\nPresenting the Message as Education\nThe message may be framed as objective information. Salespeople, for example, may try to\nconvey the impression they are less interested in selling a product than helping you make the\nbest decision. The implicit message is that being informed is in everyone\u2019s best interest,\nbecause they are confident that when you understand what their product has to offer that Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 523\nyou will conclude it is the best choice. Levine (2003) describes how, during training for a job\nas a used car salesman, he was instructed: \u201cIf the customer tells you they do not want to be\nbothered by a salesperson, your response is \u2018I\u2019m not a salesperson, I\u2019m a product consultant.\nI don\u2019t give prices or negotiate with you. I\u2019m simply here to show you our inventory and help\nyou find a vehicle that will fit your needs.\u2019\u201d\nWord of Mouth\nImagine you read an ad that claims a new restaurant has the best food in your city. Now,\nimagine a friend tells you this new restaurant has the best food in the city. Who are you more\nlikely to believe? Surveys show we turn to people around us for many decisions. A 1995 poll\nfound that 70% of Americans rely on personal advice when selecting a new doctor. The same\npoll found that 53% of moviegoers are influenced by the recommendation of a person they\nknow. In another survey, 91% said they\u2019re likely to use another person\u2019s recommendation\nwhen making a major purchase.\nPersuasion professionals may exploit these tendencies. Often, in fact, they pay for the surveys.\nUsing this data, they may try to disguise their message as word of mouth from your peers.\nFor example, Cornerstone Promotion, a leading marketing firm that advertises itself as under-\nthe-radar marketing specialists, sometimes hires children to log into chat rooms and pretend\nto be fans of one of their clients or pays students to throw parties where they subtly circulate\nmarketing material among their classmates.\nThe Maven\nMore persuasive yet, however, is to involve peers face-to-face. Rather than over-investing in\nformal advertising, businesses and organizations may plant seeds at the grassroots level\nhoping that consumers themselves will then spread the word to each other. The seeding\nprocess begins by identifying so-called information hubs\u2014individuals the marketers believe\ncan and will reach the most other people.\nThe seeds may be planted with established opinion leaders. Software companies, for example,\ngive advance copies of new computer programs to professors they hope will recommend it\nto students and colleagues. Pharmaceutical companies regularly provide travel expenses and\nspeaking fees to researchers willing to lecture to health professionals about the virtues of\ntheir drugs. Hotels give travel agents free weekends at their resorts in the hope they\u2019ll later\nrecommend them to clients seeking advice. Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 524\nThere is a Yiddish word, maven, which refers to a person who\u2019s an expert or a connoisseur,\nas in a friend who knows where to get the best price on a sofa or the co-worker you can turn\nto for advice about where to buy a computer. They (a) know a lot of people, (b) communicate\na great deal with people, (c) are more likely than others to be asked for their opinions, and (d)\nenjoy spreading the word about what they know and think. Most important of all, they are\ntrusted. As a result, mavens are often targeted by persuasion professionals to help spread\ntheir message.\nOther Tricks of Persuasion\nThere are many other mindless, mental shortcuts\u2014heuristics and fixed action patterns\u2014that\nleave us susceptible to persuasion. A few examples:\n\u2022 \"Free Gifts\" & Reciprocity\n\u2022 Social Proof\n\u2022 Getting a Foot-in-the-Door\n\u2022 A Door-in-the-Face\n\u2022 \"And That's Not All\"\n\u2022 The Sunk Cost Trap\n\u2022 Scarcity & Psychological Reactance\nReciprocity\n\u201cThere is no duty more indispensable than that of returning a kindness,\u201d wrote Cicero. Humans\nare motivated by a sense of equity and fairness. When someone does something for us or\ngives us something, we feel obligated to return the favor in kind. It triggers one of the most\npowerful of social norms, the reciprocity rule, whereby we feel compelled to repay, in equitable\nvalue, what another person has given to us.\nGouldner (1960), in his seminal study of the reciprocity rule, found it appears in every culture.\nIt lays the basis for virtually every type of social relationship, from the legalities of business\narrangements to the subtle exchanges within a romance. A salesperson may offer free gifts,\nconcessions, or their valuable time in order to get us to do something for them in return. For\nexample, if a colleague helps you when you\u2019re busy with a project, you might feel obliged to\nsupport her ideas for improving team processes. You might decide to buy more from a supplier\nif they have offered you an aggressive discount. Or, you might give money to a charity Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 525\nfundraiser who has given you a flower in the street (Cialdini, 2008; Levine, 2003).\nSocial Proof\nIf everyone is doing it, it must be right. People are more likely to work late if others on their\nteam are doing the same, to put a tip in a jar that already contains money, or eat in a restaurant\nthat is busy. This principle derives from two extremely powerful social forces\u2014social\ncomparison and conformity. We compare our behavior to what others are doing and, if there\nis a discrepancy between the other person and ourselves, we feel pressure to change (Cialdini,\n2008).\nThe principle of social proof is so\ncommon that it easily passes unnoticed.\nAdvertisements, for example, often\nconsist of little more than attractive\nsocial models appealing to our desire to\nbe one of the group. For example, the\nGerman candy company Haribo suggests\nthat when you purchase their products\nyou are joining a larger society of\nsatisfied customers: \u201cKids and grown-\nups love it so-- the happy world of\nHaribo\u201d. Sometimes social cues are\nWhile few people really like to wait in long lines, we might do it\npresented with such specificity that it is\nanyway in certain situations. If enough people are willing to wait it\nas if the target is being manipulated by a (usually) is a sign that there is something worth having at the end.\npuppeteer\u2014for example, the laugh A line in front of a restaurant, movie, etc. is social proof that will\ntracks on situation comedies that likely influence other people to try. [Photo: mattdaily]\ninstruct one not only when to laugh but\nhow to laugh. Studies find these techniques work. Fuller and Skeehy-Skeffington (1974), for\nexample, found that audiences laughed longer and more when a laugh track accompanied\nthe show than when it did not, even though respondents knew the laughs they heard were\nconnived by a technician from old tapes that had nothing to do with the show they were\nwatching. People are particularly susceptible to social proof (a) when they are feeling uncertain,\nand (b) if the people in the comparison group seem to be similar to ourselves. As P.T. Barnum\nonce said, \u201cNothing draws a crowd like a crowd.\u201d\nCommitment and Consistency Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 526\nWesterners have a desire to both feel and be perceived to act consistently. Once we have\nmade an initial commitment, it is more likely that we will agree to subsequent commitments\nthat follow from the first. Knowing this, a clever persuasion artist might induce someone to\nagree to a difficult-to-refuse small request and follow this with progressively larger requests\nthat were his target from the beginning. The process is known as getting a foot in the door\nand then slowly escalating the commitments.\nParadoxically, we are less likely to say \u201cNo\u201d to a large request than we are to a small request\nwhen it follows this pattern. This can have costly consequences. Levine (2003), for example,\nfound ex-cult members tend to agree with the statement: \u201cNobody ever joins a cult. They just\npostpone the decision to leave.\u201d\nA Door in the Face\nSome techniques bring a paradoxical approach to the escalation sequence by pushing a\nrequest to or beyond its acceptable limit and then backing off. In the door-in-the-face\n(sometimes called the reject-then-compromise) procedure, the persuader begins with a large\nrequest they expect will be rejected. They want the door to be slammed in their face. Looking\nforlorn, they now follow this with a smaller request, which, unknown to the customer, was\ntheir target all along.\nIn one study, for example, Mowen and Cialdini (1980), posing as representatives of the fictitious\n\u201cCalifornia Mutual Insurance Co.,\u201d asked university students walking on campus if they\u2019d be\nwilling to fill out a survey about safety in the home or dorm. The survey, students were told,\nwould take about 15 minutes. Not surprisingly, most of the students declined\u2014only one out\nof four complied with the request. In another condition, however, the researchers door-in-\nthe-faced them by beginning with a much larger request. \u201cThe survey takes about two hours,\u201d\nstudents were told. Then, after the subject declined to participate, the experimenters retreated\nto the target request: \u201c. . . look, one part of the survey is particularly important and is fairly\nshort. It will take only 15 minutes to administer.\u201d Almost twice as many now complied.\nAnd That\u2019s Not All!\nThe that\u2019s-not-all technique also begins with the salesperson asking a high price. This is\nfollowed by several seconds\u2019 pause during which the customer is kept from responding. The\nsalesperson then offers a better deal by either lowering the price or adding a bonus product.\nThat\u2019s-not-all is a variation on door-in-the-face. Whereas the latter begins with a request that\nwill be rejected, however, that\u2019s-not-all gains its influence by putting the customer on the Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 527\nfence, allowing them to waver and then offering them a comfortable way off.\nBurger (1986) demonstrated the technique in a series of field experiments. In one study, for\nexample, an experimenter-salesman told customers at a student bake sale that cupcakes cost\n75 cents. As this price was announced, another salesman held up his hand and said, \u201cWait a\nsecond,\u201d briefly consulted with the first salesman, and then announced (\u201cthat\u2019s-not-all\u201d) that\nthe price today included two cookies. In a control condition, customers were offered the\ncupcake and two cookies as a package for 75 cents right at the onset. The bonus worked\nmagic: Almost twice as many people bought cupcakes in the that\u2019s-not-all condition (73%)\nthan in the control group (40%).\nThe Sunk Cost Trap\nSunk cost is a term used in economics referring to nonrecoverable investments of time or\nmoney. The trap occurs when a person\u2019s aversion to loss impels them to throw good money\nafter bad, because they don\u2019t want to waste their earlier investment. This is vulnerable to\nmanipulation. The more time and energy a cult recruit can be persuaded to spend with the\ngroup, the more \u201cinvested\u201d they will feel, and, consequently, the more of a loss it will feel to\nleave that group. Consider the advice of billionaire investor Warren Buffet: \u201cWhen you find\nyourself in a hole, the best thing you can do is stop digging\u201d (Levine, 2003).\nScarcity and Psychological Reactance\nPeople tend to perceive things as more\nattractive when their availability is limited,\nor when they stand to lose the opportunity\nto acquire them on favorable terms (Cialdini,\n2008). Anyone who has encountered a\nwillful child is familiar with this principle. In\na classic study, Brehm & Weinraub (1977),\nfor example, placed 2-year-old boys in a\nroom with a pair of equally attractive toys.\nOne of the toys was placed next to a\nplexiglass wall; the other was set behind the\nPeople may be more attracted to an opportunity when supplies\nplexiglass. For some boys, the wall was 1 foot\nor time is limited. [Photo: watz]\nhigh, which allowed the boys to easily reach\nover and touch the distant toy. Given this easy access, they showed no particular preference\nfor one toy or the other. For other boys, however, the wall was a formidable 2 feet high, which Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 528\nrequired them to walk around the barrier to touch the toy. When confronted with this wall\nof inaccessibility, the boys headed directly for the forbidden fruit, touching it three times as\nquickly as the accessible toy.\nResearch shows that much of that 2-year-old remains in adults, too. People resent being\ncontrolled. When a person seems too pushy, we get suspicious, annoyed, often angry, and\nyearn to retain our freedom of choice more than before. Brehm (1966) labeled this the principle\nof psychological reactance.\nThe most effective way to circumvent psychological reactance is to first get a foot in the door\nand then escalate the demands so gradually that there is seemingly nothing to react against.\nHassan (1988), who spent many years as a higher-up in the \u201cMoonies\u201d cult, describes how\nthey would shape behaviors subtly at first, then more forcefully. The material that would make\nup the new identity of a recruit was doled out gradually, piece by piece, only as fast as the\nperson was deemed ready to assimilate it. The rule of thumb was to \u201ctell him only what he\ncan accept.\u201d He continues: \u201cDon\u2019t sell them [the converts] more than they can handle . . . . If\na recruit started getting angry because he was learning too much about us, the person working\non him would back off and let another member move in .....\u201d\nDefending Against Unwelcome Persuasion\nThe most commonly used approach to help people defend against unwanted persuasion is\nknown as the \u201cinoculation\u201d method. Research has shown that people who are subjected to\nweak versions of a persuasive message are less vulnerable to stronger versions later on, in\nmuch the same way that being exposed to small doses of a virus immunizes you against full-\nblown attacks. In a classic study by McGuire (1964), subjects were asked to state their opinion\non an issue. They were then mildly attacked for their position and then given an opportunity\nto refute the attack. When later confronted by a powerful argument against their initial\nopinion, these subjects were more resistant than were a control group. In effect, they\ndeveloped defenses that rendered them immune.\nSagarin and his colleagues have developed a more aggressive version of this technique that\nthey refer to as \u201cstinging\u201d (Sagarin, Cialdini, Rice, & Serna, 2002). Their studies focused on the\npopular advertising tactic whereby well-known authority figures are employed to sell products\nthey know nothing about, for example, ads showing a famous astronaut pontificating on Rolex\nwatches. In a first experiment, they found that simply forewarning people about the\ndeviousness of these ads had little effect on peoples\u2019 inclination to buy the product later. Next,\nthey stung the subjects. This time, they were immediately confronted with their gullibility. Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 529\n\u201cTake a look at your answer to the first question. Did you find the ad to be even somewhat\nconvincing? If so, then you got fooled. ... Take a look at your answer to the second question.\nDid you notice that this \u2018stockbroker\u2019 was a fake?\u201d They were then asked to evaluate a new set\nof ads. The sting worked. These subjects were not only more likely to recognize the\nmanipulativeness of deceptive ads; they were also less likely to be persuaded by them.\nAnti-vulnerability trainings such as these can be helpful. Ultimately, however, the most\neffective defense against unwanted persuasion is to accept just how vulnerable we are. One\nmust, first, accept that it is normal to be vulnerable and, second, to learn to recognize the\ndanger signs when we are falling prey. To be forewarned is to be forearmed.\nConclusion\nThis module has provided a brief introduction to the psychological processes and subsequent\n\u201ctricks\u201d involved in persuasion. It has emphasized the peripheral route of persuasion because\nthis is when we are most vulnerable to psychological manipulation. These vulnerabilities are\nside effects of \u201cnormal\u201d and usually adaptive psychological processes. Mindless heuristics\noffer shortcuts for coping with a hopelessly complicated world. They are necessities for human\nsurvival. All, however, underscore the dangers that accompany any mindless thinking. Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 530\nOutside Resources\nBook: Ariely, D. (2008).

Burger\nWe often change our attitudes and behaviors to match the attitudes and behaviors of the\npeople around us. One reason for this conformity is a concern about what other people think\nof us. This process was demonstrated in a classic study in which college students deliberately\ngave wrong answers to a simple visual judgment task rather than go against the group. Another\nreason we conform to the norm is because other people often have information we do not,\nand relying on norms can be a reasonable strategy when we are uncertain about how we are\nsupposed to act. Unfortunately, we frequently misperceive how the typical person acts, which\ncan contribute to problems such as the excessive binge drinking often seen in college students.\nObeying orders from an authority figure can sometimes lead to disturbing behavior. This\ndanger was illustrated in a famous study in which participants were instructed to administer\npainful electric shocks to another person in what they believed to be a learning experiment.\nDespite vehement protests from the person receiving the shocks, most participants continued\nthe procedure when instructed to do so by the experimenter. The findings raise questions\nabout the power of blind obedience in deplorable situations such as atrocities and genocide.\nThey also raise concerns about the ethical treatment of participants in psychology\nexperiments.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Become aware of how widespread conformity is in our lives and some of the ways each of\nus changes our attitudes and behavior to match the norm.\n\u2022 Understand the two primary reasons why people often conform to perceived norms.\n\u2022 Appreciate how obedience to authority has been examined in laboratory studies and some\nof the implications of the findings from these investigations.\n\u2022 Consider some of the remaining issues and sources of controversy surrounding Milgram\u2019s Conformity and Obedience 537\nobedience studies.\nIntroduction\nWhen he was a teenager, my son often enjoyed looking at photographs of me and my wife\ntaken when we were in high school. He laughed at the hairstyles, the clothing, and the kind\nof glasses people wore \u201cback then.\u201d And when he was through with his ridiculing, we would\npoint out that no one is immune to fashions and fads and that someday his children will\nprobably be equally amused by his high school photographs and the trends he found so\nnormal at the time.\nEveryday observation confirms that we often adopt the actions and attitudes of the people\naround us. Trends in clothing, music, foods, and entertainment are obvious. But our views on\npolitical issues, religious questions, and lifestyles also reflect to some degree the attitudes of\nthe people we interact with. Similarly, decisions about behaviors such as smoking and drinking\nare influenced by whether the people we spend time with engage in these activities.\nPsychologists refer to this widespread tendency to act and think like the people around us as\nconformity.\nFashion trends serve as good, and sometimes embarrassing, examples of\nour own susceptibility to conformity. [Photo: messtiza] Conformity and Obedience 538\nConformity\nWhat causes all this conformity? To start, humans may possess an inherent tendency to imitate\nthe actions of others. Although we usually are not aware of it, we often mimic the gestures,\nbody posture, language, talking speed, and many other behaviors of the people we interact\nwith. Researchers find that this mimicking increases the connection between people and\nallows our interactions to flow more smoothly (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999).\nBeyond this automatic tendency to imitate others, psychologists have identified two primary\nreasons for conformity. The first of these is normative influence. When normative influence\nis operating, people go along with the crowd because they are concerned about what others\nthink of them. We don\u2019t want to look out of step or become the target of criticism just because\nwe like different kinds of music or dress differently than everyone else. Fitting in also brings\nrewards such as camaraderie and compliments.\nHow powerful is normative influence? Consider a classic study conducted many years ago by\nSolomon Asch (1956). The participants were male college students who were asked to engage\nin a seemingly simple task. An experimenter standing several feet away held up a card that\ndepicted one line on the left side and three lines on the right side. The participant\u2019s job was\nto say aloud which of the three lines on the right was the same length as the line on the left.\nSixteen cards were presented one at a time, and the correct answer on each was so obvious\nas to make the task a little boring. Except for one thing. The participant was not alone. In fact,\nthere were six other people in the room who also gave their answers to the line-judgment\ntask aloud. Moreover, although they pretended to be fellow participants, these other\nindividuals were, in fact, confederates working with the experimenter. The real participant\nwas seated so that he always gave his answer after hearing what five other \u201cparticipants\u201d said.\nEverything went smoothly until the third trial, when inexplicably the first \u201cparticipant\u201d gave\nan obviously incorrect answer. The mistake might have been amusing, except the second\nparticipant gave the same answer. As did the third, the fourth, and the fifth participant.\nSuddenly the real participant was in a difficult situation. His eyes told him one thing, but five\nout of five people apparently saw something else.\nIt\u2019s one thing to wear your hair a certain way or like certain foods because everyone around\nyou does. But, would participants intentionally give a wrong answer just to conform with the\nother participants? The confederates uniformly gave incorrect answers on 12 of the 16 trials,\nand 76 percent of the participants went along with the norm at least once and also gave the\nwrong answer. In total, they conformed with the group on one-third of the 12 test trials.\nAlthough we might be impressed that the majority of the time participants answered honestly, Conformity and Obedience 539\nmost psychologists find it remarkable that so\nmany college students caved in to the pressure\nof the group rather than do the job they had\nvolunteered to do. In almost all cases, the\nparticipants knew they were giving an incorrect\nanswer, but their concern for what these other\npeople might be thinking about them\noverpowered their desire to do the right thing.\nVariations of Asch\u2019s procedures have been\nconducted numerous times (Bond, 2005; Bond\nExamples of the cards used in the Asch experiment. How & Smith, 1996). We now know that the findings\npowerful is the normative influence? Would you be tempted\nare easily replicated, that there is an increase\nto give a clearly incorrect answer, like many participants in\nin conformity with more confederates (up to\nthe Asch experiment did, to better match the thoughts of\nabout five), that teenagers are more prone to\na group of peers? [Image: wikimedia commons]\nconforming than are adults, and that people\nconform significantly less often when they believe the confederates will not hear their\nresponses (Berndt, 1979; Bond, 2005; Crutchfield, 1955; Deutsch & Gerard, 1955). This last\nfinding is consistent with the notion that participants change their answers because they are\nconcerned about what others think of them. Finally, although we see the effect in virtually\nevery culture that has been studied, more conformity is found in collectivist countries such\nas Japan and China than in individualistic countries such as the United States (Bond & Smith,\n1996). Compared with individualistic cultures, people who live in collectivist cultures place a\nhigher value on the goals of the group than on individual preferences. They also are more\nmotivated to maintain harmony in their interpersonal relations.\nThe other reason we sometimes go along with the crowd is that people are often a source of\ninformation. Psychologists refer to this process as informational influence. Most of us, most\nof the time, are motivated to do the right thing. If society deems that we put litter in a proper\ncontainer, speak softly in libraries, and tip our waiter, then that\u2019s what most of us will do. But\nsometimes it\u2019s not clear what society expects of us. In these situations, we often rely on\ndescriptive norms (Cialdini, Reno, & Kallgren, 1990). That is, we act the way most people\u2014or\nmost people like us\u2014act. This is not an unreasonable strategy. Other people often have\ninformation that we do not, especially when we find ourselves in new situations. If you have\never been part of a conversation that went something like this,\n\u201cDo you think we should?\u201d\n\u201cSure. Everyone else is doing it.\u201d, Conformity and Obedience 540\nyou have experienced the power of informational influence.\nHowever, it\u2019s not always easy to obtain good descriptive norm information, which means we\nsometimes rely on a flawed notion of the norm when deciding how we should behave. A good\nexample of how misperceived norms can lead to problems is found in research on binge\ndrinking among college students. Excessive drinking is a serious problem on many campuses\n(Mita, 2009). There are many reasons why students binge drink, but one of the most important\nis their perception of the descriptive norm. How much students drink is highly correlated with\nhow much they believe the average student drinks (Neighbors, Lee, Lewis, Fossos, & Larimer,\n2007). Unfortunately, students aren\u2019t very good at making this assessment. They notice the\nboisterous heavy drinker at the party but fail to consider all the students not attending the\nparty. As a result, students typically overestimate the descriptive norm for college student\ndrinking (Borsari & Carey, 2003; Perkins, Haines, & Rice, 2005). Most students believe they\nconsume significantly less alcohol than the norm, a miscalculation that creates a dangerous\npush toward more and more excessive alcohol consumption. On the positive side, providing\nstudents with accurate information about drinking norms has been found to reduce\noverindulgent drinking (Burger, LaSalvia, Hendricks, Mehdipour, & Neudeck, 2011; Neighbors,\nLee, Lewis, Fossos, & Walter, 2009).\nResearchers have demonstrated the power of\ndescriptive norms in a number of areas.\nHomeowners reduced the amount of energy they\nused when they learned that they were\nconsuming more energy than their neighbors\n(Schultz, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, & Griskevicius,\n2007). Undergraduates selected the healthy food\noption when led to believe that other students\nhad made this choice (Burger et al., 2010). Hotel\nguests were more likely to reuse their towels\nwhen a hanger in the bathroom told them that\nthis is what most guests did (Goldstein, Cialdini,\n& Griskevicius, 2008). And more people began\nEfforts to influence people to engage in healthier or\nusing the stairs instead of the elevator when\nmore sustainable behaviors have benefitted from use\nof the informational influence. For example, hotels have informed that the vast majority of people took\nbeen able to significantly increase the numbers of the stairs to go up one or two floors (Burger &\npeople who re-use bath towels (reducing water and\nShelton, 2011).\nenergy use) by informing them on signs in their rooms\nthat re-using towels is a typical behavior of other hotel\nObedience\nguests. [Image: Tubetroll] Conformity and Obedience 541\nAlthough we may be influenced by the people around us more than we recognize, whether\nwe conform to the norm is up to us. But sometimes decisions about how to act are not so\neasy. Sometimes we are directed by a more powerful person to do things we may not want\nto do. Researchers who study obedience are interested in how people react when given an\norder or command from someone in a position of authority. In many situations, obedience\nis a good thing. We are taught at an early age to obey parents, teachers, and police officers.\nIt\u2019s also important to follow instructions from judges, firefighters, and lifeguards. And a military\nwould fail to function if soldiers stopped obeying orders from superiors. But, there is also a\ndark side to obedience. In the name of \u201cfollowing orders\u201d or \u201cjust doing my job,\u201d people can\nviolate ethical principles and break laws. More disturbingly, obedience often is at the heart\nof some of the worst of human behavior\u2014massacres, atrocities, and even genocide.\nIt was this unsettling side of obedience that\nled to some of the most famous and most\ncontroversial research in the history of\npsychology. Milgram (1963, 1965, 1974)\nwanted to know why so many otherwise\ndecent German citizens went along with\nthe brutality of the Nazi leaders during the\nHolocaust. \u201cThese inhumane policies may\nhave originated in the mind of a single\nperson,\u201d Milgram (1963, p. 371) wrote, \u201cbut\nthey could only be carried out on a massive\nPhotographs of victims of Cambodian dictator Pol Pot. From\nscale if a very large number of persons\n1975-79 the Khmer Rouge army obediently carried out orders to\nobeyed orders.\u201d\nexecute tens of thousands of civilians. [Photo: Rusty Stewart]\nTo understand this obedience, Milgram conducted a series of laboratory investigations. In all\nbut one variation of the basic procedure, participants were men recruited from the community\nsurrounding Yale University, where the research was carried out. These citizens signed up for\nwhat they believed to be an experiment on learning and memory. In particular, they were told\nthe research concerned the effects of punishment on learning. Three people were involved\nin each session. One was the participant. Another was the experimenter. The third was a\nconfederate who pretended to be another participant.\nThe experimenter explained that the study consisted of a memory test and that one of the\nmen would be the teacher and the other the learner. Through a rigged drawing, the real\nparticipant was always assigned the teacher\u2019s role and the confederate was always the learner.\nThe teacher watched as the learner was strapped into a chair and had electrodes attached\nto his wrist. The teacher then moved to the room next door where he was seated in front of Conformity and Obedience 542\na large metal box the experimenter identified as a \u201cshock generator.\u201d The front of the box\ndisplayed gauges and lights and, most noteworthy, a series of 30 levers across the bottom.\nEach lever was labeled with a voltage figure, starting with 15 volts and moving up in 15-volt\nincrements to 450 volts. Labels also indicated the strength of the shocks, starting with \u201cSlight\nShock\u201d and moving up to \u201cDanger: Severe Shock\u201d toward the end. The last two levers were\nsimply labeled \u201cXXX\u201d in red.\nThrough a microphone, the teacher administered\na memory test to the learner in the next room.\nThe learner responded to the multiple-choice\nitems by pressing one of four buttons that were\nbarely within reach of his strapped-down hand.\nIf the teacher saw the correct answer light up on\nhis side of the wall, he simply moved on to the\nnext item. But if the learner got the item wrong,\nthe teacher pressed one of the shock levers and,\nthereby, delivered the learner\u2019s punishment. The\nteacher was instructed to start with the 15-volt\nlever and move up to the next highest shock for\neach successive wrong answer.\nIn reality, the learner received no shocks. But he\ndid make a lot of mistakes on the test, which\nforced the teacher to administer what he\nDiagram of the Milgram Experiment. \"E\" = the believed to be increasingly strong shocks. The\nexperimenter, \"T\" = the teacher, who was the focus of\npurpose of the study was to see how far the\nthe experiment, \"L\" = the learner, the person expected\nteacher would go before refusing to continue.\nto receive the shocks but who was actually an actor\nThe teacher\u2019s first hint that something was amiss\ncooperating with the experimenter. [Image: \"Milgram\nexperiment v2\" by Fred the Oyster - wikimedia came after pressing the 75-volt lever and hearing\ncommons] through the wall the learner say \u201cUgh!\u201d The\nlearner\u2019s reactions became stronger and louder\nwith each lever press. At 150 volts, the learner yelled out, \u201cExperimenter! That\u2019s all. Get me\nout of here. I told you I had heart trouble. My heart\u2019s starting to bother me now. Get me out\nof here, please. My heart\u2019s starting to bother me. I refuse to go on. Let me out.\u201d\nThe experimenter\u2019s role was to encourage the participant to continue. If at any time the teacher\nasked to end the session, the experimenter responded with phrases such as, \u201cThe experiment\nrequires that you continue,\u201d and \u201cYou have no other choice, you must go on.\u201d The experimenter\nended the session only after the teacher stated four successive times that he did not want to Conformity and Obedience 543\ncontinue. All the while, the learner\u2019s protests became more intense with each shock. After 300\nvolts, the learner refused to answer any more questions, which led the experimenter to say\nthat no answer should be considered a wrong answer. After 330 volts, despite vehement\nprotests from the learner following previous shocks, the teacher heard only silence, suggesting\nthat the learner was now physically unable to respond. If the teacher reached 450 volts\u2014the\nend of the generator\u2014the experimenter told him to continue pressing the 450 volt lever for\neach wrong answer. It was only after the teacher pressed the 450-volt lever three times that\nthe experimenter announced that the study was over.\nIf you had been a participant in this research, what would you have done? Virtually everyone\nsays he or she would have stopped early in the process. And most people predict that very\nfew if any participants would keep pressing all the way to 450 volts. Yet in the basic procedure\ndescribed here, 65 percent of the participants continued to administer shocks to the very end\nof the session. These were not brutal, sadistic men. They were ordinary citizens who\nnonetheless followed the experimenter\u2019s instructions to administer what they believed to be\nexcruciating if not dangerous electric shocks to an innocent person. The disturbing implication\nfrom the findings is that, under the right circumstances, each of us may be capable of acting\nin some very uncharacteristic and perhaps some very unsettling ways.\nIf you had been \"a teacher\" in the Milgram experiment, would you have behaved differently\nthan the majority who delivered what they thought were massive 450-volt shocks? [Photo:\nSharon Drummond]\nMilgram conducted many variations of this basic procedure to explore some of the factors Conformity and Obedience 544\nthat affect obedience. He found that obedience rates decreased when the learner was in the\nsame room as the experimenter and declined even further when the teacher had to physically\ntouch the learner to administer the punishment. Participants also were less willing to continue\nthe procedure after seeing other teachers refuse to press the shock levers, and they were\nsignificantly less obedient when the instructions to continue came from a person they believed\nto be another participant rather than from the experimenter. Finally, Milgram found that\nwomen participants followed the experimenter\u2019s instructions at exactly the same rate the\nmen had.\nMilgram\u2019s obedience research has been the subject of much controversy and discussion.\nPsychologists continue to debate the extent to which Milgram\u2019s studies tell us something\nabout atrocities in general and about the behavior of German citizens during the Holocaust\nin particular (Miller, 2004). Certainly, there are important features of that time and place that\ncannot be recreated in a laboratory, such as a pervasive climate of prejudice and\ndehumanization. Another issue concerns the relevance of the findings. Some people have\nargued that today we are more aware of the dangers of blind obedience than we were when\nthe research was conducted back in the 1960s. However, findings from partial and modified\nreplications of Milgram\u2019s procedures conducted in recent years suggest that people respond\nto the situation today much like they did a half a century ago (Burger, 2009).\nAnother point of controversy concerns the ethical treatment of research participants.\nResearchers have an obligation to look out for the welfare of their participants. Yet, there is\nlittle doubt that many of Milgram\u2019s participants experienced intense levels of stress as they\nwent through the procedure. In his defense, Milgram was not unconcerned about the effects\nof the experience on his participants. And in follow-up questionnaires, the vast majority of\nhis participants said they were pleased they had been part of the research and thought similar\nexperiments should be conducted in the future. Nonetheless, in part because of Milgram\u2019s\nstudies, guidelines and procedures were developed to protect research participants from\nthese kinds of experiences. Although Milgram\u2019s intriguing findings left us with many\nunanswered questions, conducting a full replication of his experiment remains out of bounds\nby today\u2019s standards.\nSocial psychologists are fond of saying that we are all influenced by the people around us\nmore than we recognize. Of course, each person is unique, and ultimately each of us makes\nchoices about how we will and will not act. But decades of research on conformity and\nobedience make it clear that we live in a social world and that\u2014for better or worse\u2014much\nof what we do is a reflection of the people we encounter.
