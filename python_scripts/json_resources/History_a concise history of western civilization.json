Furthermore, who or what is part of it? Like all ideas,\nthe concept of Western Civilization itself has a history, one that coalesced in college textbooks\nand curriculums for the first time in the United States in the 1920s. In many ways, the very idea\nof Western Civilization is a \u201cloaded\u201d one, opposing one form or branch of civilization from others\nas if they were distinct, even unrelated. Thus, before examining the events of Western\nCivilization\u2019s history, it is important to unpack the history of the concept itself.\nWhere is the West?\nThe obvious question is \u201cwest of what\u201d? Likewise, where is \u201cthe east\u201d? Terms used in\npresent-day geopolitics regularly make reference to an east and west, as in \u201cFar East,\u201d and\n\u201cMiddle East,\u201d as well as in \u201cWestern\u201d ideas or attitudes. The obvious answer is that \u201cthe West\u201d\nhas something to do with Europe. If the area including Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Israel -\nPalestine, and Egypt is somewhere called the \u201cMiddle\u201d or \u201cNear\u201d East, doesn't that imply that it\nis just to the east of something else?\nIn fact, we get the original term from ancient Greece. Greece is the center-point, east of\nthe Balkan Peninsula was east, west of the Balkans was west, and the Greeks were at the\ncenter of their self-understood world. Likewise, the sea that both separated and united the\nGreeks and their neighbors, including the Egyptians and the Persians, is still called the\nMediterranean, which means \u201csea in the middle of the earth\u201d (albeit in Latin, not Greek - we get\nthe word from a later \"Western\" civilization, the Romans). The ancient civilizations clustered\naround the Mediterranean treated it as the center of the world itself, their major trade route to\none another and a major source of their food as well.\nTo the Greeks, there were two kinds of people: Greeks and barbarians (the Greek word\nis barbaros). Supposedly, the word barbarian came from Greeks mocking the sound of\nnon-Greek languages: \u201cbar-bar-bar-bar.\u201d The Greeks traded with all of their neighbors and\nknew perfectly well that the Persians and the Egyptians and the Phoenicians, among others,\nwere not their inferiors in learning, art, or political organization, but the fact remains that they\n3 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nwere not Greek, either. Thus, one of the core themes of Western Civilization is that right from its\ninception, of the east being east of Greece and the west being west of Greece, and of the world\nbeing divided between Greeks and barbarians, there was an idea of who is central and superior,\nand who is out on the edges and inferior (or at least not part of the best version of civilization).\nIn a sense, then, the Greeks invented the idea of west and east, but they did not extend\nthe idea to anyone but themselves, certainly including the \u201cbarbarians\u201d who inhabited the rest of\nEurope. In other words, the Greeks did not have a concept of \u201cWestern Civilization,\u201d just Greek\nvs. barbarian. Likewise, the Greeks did not invent \u201ccivilization\u201d itself; they inherited things like\nagriculture and writing from their neighbors. Neither was there ever a united Greek empire:\nthere was a great Greek civilization when Alexander the Great conquered what he thought was\nmost of the world, stretching from Greece itself through Egypt, the Middle East, as far as\nwestern India, but it collapsed into feuding kingdoms after he died. Thus, while later cultures\ncame to look to the Greeks as their intellectual and cultural ancestors, the Greeks themselves\ndid not set out to found \u201cWestern Civilization\u201d itself.\nMesopotamia\nWhile many traditional Western Civilization textbooks start with Greece, this one does\nnot. That is because civilization is not Greek in its origins. The most ancient human civilizations\narose in the Fertile Crescent, an area stretching from present-day Israel - Palestine through\nsouthern Turkey and into Iraq. Closely related, and lying within the Fertile Crescent, is the\nregion of Mesopotamia, which is the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in\npresent-day Iraq. In these areas, people invented the most crucial technology necessary for the\ndevelopment of civilization: agriculture. The Mesopotamians also invented other things that are\ncentral to civilization, including:\n\u25cf Cities: note that in English, the very word \u201ccivilization\u201d is closely related to the word\n\u201ccivic,\u201d meaning \u201chaving to do with cities\u201d as in \"civic government\" or \"civic duty.\" Cities\nwere essential to sophisticated human groups because they allowed specialization: you\ncould have some people concentrate all of their time and energy on tasks like art,\nbuilding, religious worship, or warfare, not just on farming.\n\u25cf Bureaucracy: while it seems like a prosaic subject, bureaucracy was and remains the\nmost effective way to organize large groups of people. Civilizations that developed large\nand efficient bureaucracies grew larger and lasted longer than those that neglected\n4 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nbureaucracy. Bureaucracy is, essentially, the substitution of rules in place of individual\nhuman decisions. That process, while often frustrating to individuals caught up in it,\ndoes have the effect of creating a more efficient set of processes than can be achieved\nthrough arbitrary decision-making. Historically, bureaucracy was one of the most\nimportant \"technologies\" that early civilizations developed.\n\u25cf Large-scale warfare: even before large cities existed, the first towns were built with\nfortifications to stave off attackers. It is very likely that the first kings were war leaders\nallied with priests.\n\u25cf Mathematics: without math, there cannot be advanced engineering, and without\nengineering, there cannot be irrigation, walls, or large buildings. The ancient\nMesopotamians were the first people in the world to develop advanced mathematics in\nlarge part because they were also the most sophisticated engineers of the ancient world.\n\u25cf Astronomy: just as math is necessary for engineering, astronomy is necessary for a\nsophisticated calendar. The ancient Mesopotamians began the process of\nsystematically recording the changing positions of the stars and other heavenly bodies\nbecause they needed to be able to track when to plant crops, when to harvest, and when\nreligious rituals had to be carried out. Among other things, the Mesopotamians were the\nfirst to discover the 365 (and a quarter) days of the year and set those days into a fixed\ncalendar.\n\u25cf Empires: an empire is a political unit comprising many different \u201cpeoples,\u201d whether\n\u201cpeople\u201d is defined linguistically, religiously, or ethnically. The Mesopotamians were the\nfirst to conquer and rule over many different cities and \u201cpeoples\u201d at once.\nThe Mesopotamians also created systems of writing, of organized religion, and of\nliterature, all of which would go on to have an enormous influence on world history, and in turn,\nWestern Civilization. Thus, in considering Western Civilization, it would be misleading to start\nwith the Greeks and skip places like Mesopotamia, because those areas were the heartland of\ncivilization in the whole western part of Eurasia.\nGreece and Rome\nEven if we do not start with the Greeks, we do need to acknowledge their importance.\nAlexander the Great was one of the most famous and important military leaders in history, a\nman who started conquering \u201cthe world\u201d when he was eighteen years old. When he died his\n5 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nempire fell apart, in part because he did not say which of his generals was to take over after his\ndeath. Nevertheless, the empires he left behind were united in important ways, using Greek as\none of their languages, employing Greek architecture in their buildings, putting on plays in the\nGreek style, and of course, trading with one another. This period in history was called the\nHellenistic Age. The people who were part of that age were European, Middle Eastern, and\nNorth African, people who worshiped both Greeks gods and the gods of their own regions,\nspoke all kinds of different languages, and lived as part of a hybrid culture. Hellenistic\ncivilization demonstrates the fact that Western Civilization has always been a blend of different\npeoples, not a single encompassing group or language or religion.\nPerhaps the most important empire in the ancient history of Western Civilization was\nancient Rome. Over the course of roughly five centuries, the Romans expanded from the city of\nRome in the middle of the Italian peninsula to rule an empire that stretched from Britain to Spain\nand from North Africa to Persia (present-day Iran). Through both incredible engineering, the\nhard work of Roman citizens and Roman subjects, and the massive use of slave labor, they built\nremarkable buildings and created infrastructure like roads and aqueducts that survive to the\npresent day.\nThe Romans are the ones who give us the idea of Western Civilization being something\nongoing \u2013 something that had started in the past and continued into the future. In the case of\nthe Romans, they (sometimes grudgingly) acknowledged Greece as a cultural model; Roman\narchitecture used Greek shapes and forms, the Roman gods were really just the Greek gods\ngiven new names (Zeus became Jupiter, Hades became Pluto, etc.), and educated Romans\nspoke and read Greek so that they could read the works of the great Greek poets, playwrights,\nand philosophers. Thus, the Romans deliberately adopted an older set of ideas and considered\nthemselves part of an ongoing civilization that blended Greek and Roman values. Like the\nGreeks before them, they also divided civilization itself in a stark binary: there was\nGreco-Roman culture on the one hand and barbarism on the other, although they made a\nreluctant exception for Persia at times.\nThe Romans were largely successful at assimilating the people they conquered. They\nunited their provinces with the Latin language, which is the ancestor of all of the major\nlanguages spoken in Southern Europe today (French, Italian, Spanish, Romanian, etc.), Roman\nLaw, which is the ancestor of most forms of law still in use today in Europe, and the Roman form\nof government. Along with those factors, the Romans brought Greek and Roman science,\nlearning, and literature to the reaches of their empire. In many ways, the Romans believed that\nthey were bringing civilization itself everywhere they went, and because they made the\n6 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nconnection between Greek civilization and their own, they played a significant role in inventing\nthe idea of Western Civilization as something that was ongoing.\nThat noted, the Romans did not use the term \u201cWestern Civilization\u201d and as their empire\nexpanded, even the connection between Roman identity and Italy itself weakened. During the\nperiod that the empire was at its height the bulk of the population and wealth was in the east,\nconcentrated in Egypt, Anatolia (the region corresponding to the present-day nation of Turkey)\nand the Middle East. This shift to the east culminated in the move of the capital of the empire\nfrom the city of Rome to the Greek town of Byzantium, renamed Constantinople by the emperor\nwho ordered the move: Constantine. Thus, while the Greco-Roman legacy was certainly a\nmajor factor in the development of the idea of Western Civilization much later, \u201cRoman\u201d was\ncertainly not the same thing as \u201cwestern\u201d at the time.\nThe Middle Ages and Christianity\nAnother stage in the development of the idea of Western Civilization came about after\nRome ceased to exist as a united empire, during the era known as the Middle Ages. The\nMiddle Ages were the period between the fall of Rome, which happened around 476 CE, and\nthe Renaissance, which started around 1300 CE. During the Middle Ages, another concept of\nwhat lay at the heart of Western Civilization arose, especially among Europeans. It was not just\nthe connection to Roman and Greek accomplishments, but instead, to religion. The Roman\nEmpire had started to become Christian in the early fourth century CE when the emperor,\nConstantine, converted to Christianity. Many Europeans in the Middle Ages came to believe\nthat, despite the fact that they spoke different languages and had different rulers, they were\nunited as part of \u201cChristendom\u201d: the kingdom of Christ and of Christians.\nChristianity obviously played a hugely important role in the history of Western\nCivilization. It inspired amazing art and music. It was at the heart of scholarship and learning\nfor centuries. It also justified the aggressive expansion of European kingdoms. Europeans truly\nbelieved that members of other religions were infidels (meaning \"those who are unfaithful,\"\nthose who worshipped the correct God, but in the wrong way, including Jews and Muslims, but\nalso Christians who deviated from official orthodoxy) or pagans (those who worshipped false\ngods) who should either convert or be exterminated. For instance, despite the fact that Muslims\nand Jews worshiped the same God and shared much of the same sacred literature, medieval\nEuropeans had absolutely no qualms about invading Muslim lands and committing horrific\natrocities in the name of their religion. Likewise, medieval anti-Semitism (prejudice and hatred\n7 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ndirected against Jews) eventually drove many Jews from Europe itself to take shelter in the\nkingdoms and empires of the Middle East and North Africa. Historically it was much safer and\nmore comfortable for Jews to live in places like the predominantly Muslim Ottoman Empire than\nin most of Christian Europe.\nA major irony of the idea that Western Civilization is somehow inherently Christian is that\nIslam is unquestionably just as \u201cWestern.\u201d Islam\u2019s point of origin, the Arabian Peninsula, is\ngeographically very close to that of both Judaism and Christianity. Its holy writings are also\nclosely aligned to Jewish and Christian values and thought. Perhaps most importantly, Islamic\nkingdoms and empires were part of the networks of trade, scholarship, and exchange that linked\ntogether the entire greater Mediterranean region. Thus, despite the fervor of European\ncrusaders, it would be profoundly misleading to separate Islamic states and cultures from the\nrest of Western Civilization.\nThe Renaissance and European Expansion\nPerhaps the most crucial development in the idea of Western Civilization in the\npre-modern period was the Renaissance. The idea of the \u201cMiddle Ages\u201d was invented by\nthinkers during the Renaissance, which started around 1300 CE. The great thinkers and artists\nof the Renaissance claimed to be moving away from the ignorance and darkness of the Middle\nAges \u2013 which they also described as the \u201cdark ages\u201d - and returning to the greatness of the\nRomans and Greeks. People like Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Christine de Pizan, and\nPetrarch proudly connected their work to the work of the Romans and Greeks, claiming that\nthere was an unbroken chain of ideas, virtues, and accomplishments stretching all the way back\nthousands of years to people like Alexander the Great, Plato, and Socrates.\nDuring the Renaissance, educated people in Europe roughly two thousand years after\nthe life of the Greek philosopher Plato based their own philosophies and outlooks on Plato's\nphilosophy, as well as that of other Greek thinkers. The beauty of Renaissance art is directly\nconnected to its inspiration in Roman and Greek art. The scientific discoveries of the\nRenaissance were inspired by the same spirit of inquiry that Greek scientists and Roman\nengineers had cultivated. Perhaps most importantly, Renaissance thinkers proudly linked\ntogether their own era to that of the Greeks and Romans, thus strengthening the concept of\nWestern Civilization as an ongoing enterprise.\nIn the process of reviving the ideas of the Greeks and Romans, Renaissance thinkers\ncreated a new program of education: \u201chumanist\u201d education. Celebrating the inherent goodness\n8 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nand potentialities of humankind, humanistic education saw in the study of classical literature a\nsource of inspiration for not just knowledge, but also morality and virtue. Combining the\npractical study of languages, history, mathematics, and rhetoric (among other subjects) with the\ncultivation of an ethical code the humanistics traced back to the Greeks, humanistic education\nultimately created a curriculum meant to create well-rounded, virtuous individuals. That\nprogram of education remained intact into the twentieth century, with the study of the classics\nremaining a hallmark of elite education until it began to be displaced by the more specialized\ndisciplinary studies of the modern university system that was born near the end of the\nnineteenth century.\nIt was not Renaissance ideas, however, that had the greatest impact on the globe at the\ntime. Instead, it was European soldiers, colonists, and most consequentially, diseases. The\nfirst people from the Eastern Hemisphere since prehistory to travel to the Western Hemisphere\n(and remain - an earlier Viking colony did not survive) were European explorers who, entirely by\naccident, \u201cdiscovered\u201d the Americas at the end of the fifteenth century CE. It bears emphasis\nthat the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the Americas is a misnomer: millions of people already lived there, as\ntheir ancestors had for thousands of years, but geography had left them ill-prepared for the\narrival of the newcomers. With the European colonists came an onslaught of epidemics to\nwhich the Native peoples of the Americas had no resistance, and within a few generations the\nimmense majority - perhaps as many as 90% - of Native Americans perished as a result. The\nsubsequent conquest of the Americas by Europeans and their descendents was thus made\nvastly easier. Europeans suddenly had access to an astonishing wealth of land and natural\nresources, wealth that they extracted in large part by enslaving millions of Native Americans and\nAfricans.\nThanks largely to the European conquest of the Americas and the exploitation of\nAmerican resources and enslaved people, Europe went from a region of little economic and\nmilitary power and importance to one of the most formidable in the following centuries.\nFollowing the Spanish and Portuguese conquest of Central and South America, the other major\nEuropean states embarked on their own imperialistic ventures in the following centuries. \u201cTrade\nempires\u201d emerged over the course of the seventeenth century, first and foremost those of the\nDutch and English, which established the precedent that profit and territorial control were\nmutually reinforcing priorities for European states. Driven by that conjoined motive, European\nstates established huge, and growing, global empires. By 1800, roughly 35% of the surface of\nthe world was controlled by Europeans or their descendants.\n9 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Modern Era\nMost of the world, however, was off limits to large-scale European expansion. Not only\nwere there prosperous and sophisticated kingdoms in many regions of Africa, but (in an ironic\nreversal of the impact of European diseases on Americans) African diseases ensured that\nwould-be European explorers and conquerors were initially unable to penetrate beyond the\ncoasts of most of sub-Saharan Africa entirely. Meanwhile, the enormous and sophisticated\nempires and kingdoms of China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and South Asia (i.e. India) largely\nregarded Europeans as incidental trading partners of relatively little importance. The Middle\nEast was dominated by two powerful and \u201cwestern\u201d empires of its own: Persia and the Ottoman\nEmpire.\nThe explosion of European power, one that coincided with the fruition of the idea that\nWestern Civilization was both distinct from and better than other branches of civilization, came\nas a result of a development in technology: the Industrial Revolution. Starting in Great Britain in\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, Europeans learned how to exploit fossil fuels in the form of\ncoal to harness hitherto unimaginable amounts of energy. That energy underwrote a vast and\ndramatic expansion of European technology, wealth, and military power, this time built on the\nbacks not of outright slaves, but of workers paid subsistence wages.\nOver the course of the nineteenth century, the Industrial Revolution underwrote and\nenabled the transformation of Europe from regional powerhouse to global hegemon. By the\nearly twentieth century, Europe and the American nations founded by the descendents of\nEuropeans controlled roughly 85% of the globe. Europeans either forced foreign states to\nconcede to their economic demands and political influence, as in China and the Ottoman\nEmpire, or simply conquered and controlled regions directly, as in South Asia (i.e. India) and\nAfrica. None of this would have been possible without the technological and energetic\nrevolution wrought by industrialism.\nTo Europeans and North Americans, however, the reason that they had come to enjoy\nsuch wealth and power was not because of a (temporary) monopoly of industrial technology.\nInstead, it was the inevitable result of their inherent biological and cultural superiority. The idea\nthat the human species was divided into biologically distinct races was not entirely invented in\nthe nineteenth century, but it became the predominant outlook and acquired all the trappings of\na \u201cscience\u201d over the course of the 1800s. By the year 1900, almost any person of European\n10 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ndescent would have claimed to be part of a distinct, superior \u201crace\u201d whose global dominance\nwas simply part of their collective birthright.\nThat conceit arrived at its zenith in the first half of the twentieth century. The European\npowers themselves fell upon one another in the First World War in the name of expanding, or at\nleast preserving, their share of global dominance. Soon after, the new (related) ideologies of\nfascism and Nazism put racial superiority at the very center of their worldviews. The Second\nWorld War was the direct result of those ideologies, when racial warfare was unleashed for the\nfirst time not just on members of races Europeans had already classified as \u201cinferior,\u201d but on\nEuropean ethnicities that fascists and Nazis now considered inferior races in their own right,\nmost obviously the Jews. The bloodbath that followed resulted in approximately 55 million\ndeaths, including the 6 million Jewish victims of the Holocaust and at least 25 million citizens of\nthe Soviet Union, another \u201cracial\u201d enemy from the perspective of the Nazis.\nWestern Civilization Is Reinvented\nIt was against the backdrop of this descent into what Europeans and Americans\nfrequently called \u201cbarbarism\u201d - the old antithesis of the \u201ctrue\u201d civilization that started with the\nGreeks - that the history of Western Civilization first came into being as a textbook topic and,\nsoon, a mainstay of college curriculums. Prominent scholars in the United States, especially\nhistorians, came to believe that the best way to defend the elements of civilization with which\nthey most strongly identified, including certain concepts of rationality and political equality, was\nto describe all of human existence as an ascent from primitive savagery into enlightenment, an\nascent that may not have strictly speaking started in Europe, but which they felt enjoyed its\ngreatest success there. The early proponents of the \u201cWestern Civ\u201d concept spoke and wrote\nexplicitly of European civilization as an unbroken ladder of ideas, technologies, and cultural\nachievements that led to the present. Along the way, of course, they included the United States\nas both a product of those European achievements and, in the twentieth century, as one of the\nstaunchest defenders of that legacy.\nThat first generation of historians of Western Civilization succeeded in crafting what was\nto be the core of history curriculums for most of the twentieth century in American colleges and\nuniversities, not to mention high schools. The narrative in the introduction in this book follows a\ntraditional Western Civilization curriculum\u2019s basic contours, without all of the qualifying remarks:\nit starts with Greece, goes through Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, then on to the\ngrowth in European power leading up to the recent past. The traditional story, however, made a\n11 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nhard and fast distinction between Western Civilization as the site of progress, and the rest of the\nworld (usually referred to as the \u201cOrient,\u201d simply meaning \u201ceast,\u201d all the way up until textbooks\nstarted changing their terms in the 1980s) which were invariably characterized as lagging\nbehind. Outside of the West, went the narrative, there was despotism, stagnation, and\ncorruption, so it was almost inevitable that the West would eventually achieve global dominance.\nThis was, in hindsight, a somewhat surprising conclusion given when the narrative was\ninvented. The West\u2019s self-understanding as the most \u201ccivilized\u201d culture had imploded with the\nworld wars, but the inventors of Western Civilization as a concept were determined to not only\nrescue its legacy from that implosion, but to celebrate it as the only major historical legacy of\nrelevance to the present. In doing so, they reinforced many of the intellectual dividing lines\ncreated centuries earlier: there was true civilization opposed by barbarians, there was an\nongoing and unbroken legacy of achievement and progress, and most importantly, only people\nwho were born in or descended from people born in Europe had played a significant historical\nrole. The entire history of most of humankind was not just irrelevant to the narrative of\nEuropean or American history, it was irrelevant to the history of the modern world for everyone.\nIn other words, Africans and Asians, to say nothing of the people of the Pacific or Native\nAmericans, could have little of relevance to learn from their own history that was not somehow\n\u201cobsolete\u201d in the modern era. And yet, this astonishing conclusion was born from a culture that\nunleashed the most horrific destruction (self-destruction) ever witnessed by the human species.\nThe Approach of This Book (with Caveats)\nThis textbook follows the contours of the basic Western Civilization narrative described\nabove in terms of chronology and, to an extent, geography because it was written to be\ncompatible with most Western Civilization courses as they exist today. It deliberately breaks,\nhowever, from the \u201ctriumphalist\u201d narrative that describes Western Civilization as the most\nsuccessful, rational, and enlightened form of civilization in human history. It casts a wider\ngeographical view than most traditional Western Civilization textbooks, focusing in many cases\non the critical historical role of the Middle East, not just Europe. It also abandons the pretense\nthat the history of Western Civilization was generally progressive, with the conditions of life and\nunderstanding of the natural world of most people improving over time (as a matter of fact, they\ndid not).\nThe purpose of this approach is not to disparage the genuine breakthroughs,\naccomplishments, and forms of \u201cprogress\u201d that did originate in \u201cthe West.\u201d Technologies as\n12 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ndiverse and important as the steam engine and antibiotics originated in the West. Major\nintellectual and ideological movements calling for religious toleration, equality before the law,\nand feminism all came into being in the West. For better and for worse, the West was also the\npoint of origin of true globalization (starting with the European contact with the Americas, as\nnoted above). It would be as misleading to dismiss the history of Western Civilization as\nunimportant as it is to claim that only the history of Western Civilization is important.\nThus, this textbook attempts to present a balanced account of major events that\noccurred in the West over approximately the last 10,000 years. \u201cBalance\u201d is in the eye of the\nreader, however, so the account will not be satisfactory to many. The purpose of this\nintroduction is to make explicit the background and the framework that informed the writing of\nthe book, and the author chooses to release it as an Open Education Resource in the\nknowledge that many others will have the opportunity to modify it as they see fit.\nFinally, a note on the kind of history this textbook covers is in order. For the sake of\nclarity and manageability, historians distinguish between different areas of historical study:\npolitical, intellectual, military, cultural, artistic, social, and so on. Historians have made\nenormous strides in the last sixty years in addressing various areas that were traditionally\nneglected, most importantly in considering the histories of the people who were not in power,\nincluding the common people of various epochs, of women for almost all of history, and of\nslaves and servants. The old adage that \u201chistory is written by the winners\u201d is simply untrue -\nhistory has left behind mountains of evidence about the lives of those who had access to less\npersonal autonomy than did social elites. Those elites did much to author some of the most\nfamiliar historical narratives, but those traditional narratives have been under sustained critique\nfor several decades.\nThis textbook tries to address at least some of those histories, but here it will be found\nwanting by many. Given the vast breadth of history covered in its chapters, the bulk of the\nconsideration is on \u201chigh level\u201d political history, charting a chronological framework of major\nstates, political events, and political changes. There are two reasons for that approach. First,\nthe history of politics lends itself to a history of events linked together by causality: first\nsomething happened, and then something else happened because of it. In turn, there is a\nfundamental coherence and simplicity to textbook narratives of political history (one that\ninfuriates many professional historians, who are trained to identify and study complexity).\nPolitical history can thus serve as an accessible starting place for newcomers to the study of\nhistory, providing a relatively easy-to-follow chronological framework.\n13 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe other, related, reason for the political framing of this textbook is that history has long\nsince declined as a subject central to education from the elementary through high school levels\nin many parts of the United States. It is no longer possible to assume that anyone who has\ncompleted high school already has some idea of major (measured by their impact at the time\nand since) events of the past. This textbook attempts to use political history as, again, a starting\npoint in considering events, people, movements, and ideas that changed the world at the time\nand continue to exert an influence in the present.\nTo be clear, not all of what follows has to do with politics in so many words.\nConsiderable attention is also given to intellectual, economic, and to an extent, religious history.\nSocial and cultural history are covered in less detail, both for reasons of space and the simple\nfact that the author was trained as an intellectual historian interested in political theory. These,\nhopefully, are areas that will be addressed in future revisions.\nOriginal Version: March 2019\nNotes on the Second Edition (\u201cVersion 2.5\u201d)\nThe second edition of this textbook attempts to redress some of the \u201cmissing pieces\u201d\nnoted in the conclusion of the introduction above. First, greater emphasis is placed on the\nhistory of the Middle East, especially in the period after the collapse of the political authority of\nthe Abbasid Caliphate in the ninth century CE. The textbook now addresses the histories of\nPersia (Iran) and the Ottoman Empire in considerable detail, emphasizing both their own\npolitical, religious, and economic developments and their respective relationships with other\ncultures. Second, much greater focus is given to the history of gender roles and to women\u2019s\nhistory.\nFrom the perspective of the author, the new material on the Middle East integrates\nnaturally with the narrative because it remains focused mostly on political history. The material\non gender and women\u2019s history requires a shift in the overall approach of the textbook in that\nwomen were almost entirely excluded from traditional \u201chigh-level\u201d political histories precisely\nbecause so few women were ever in positions of political authority until the recent past. The\nshift in focus to include more women\u2019s history necessarily entails greater emphasis not just on\ngender roles, but on the social history of everyday life, stepping away at times from the political\nhistory framework of the volumes as a whole. The result is a broader and more robust historical\n14 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\naccount than that of the earlier edition, although the overarching narrative is still driven by\npolitical developments.\nAs of the autumn of 2021 the first volume of this textbook is now in its \u201cVersion 2.5,\u201d\npreserving the entire second edition with a few key changes. Wendy Fall, at the time of this\nrelease a Ph.D. candidate in literature at Marquette University, was kind enough to volunteer to\nedit the entire first volume. She corrected numerous grammatical issues and streamlined the\nphrasing considerably. Wendy also provided additional content, especially on literary history,\nwhich has enriched the intellectual and cultural histories covered in the volume. My sincere\nthanks to Wendy for her efforts!\nFinally, a note on grammatical conventions: in keeping with most American English\napproaches, the writing errs on the side of capitalizing proper nouns. For example, terms like\n\u201cthe Church\u201d when referring to the Catholic Church in its institutional presence, specific regions\nlike \u201cWestern Europe,\u201d and historical eras like \u201cthe Middle Ages\u201d and \u201cthe Enlightenment\u201d are all\ncapitalized. When possible, the names of individuals are kept as close to their authentic\nspelling and/or pronunciation as possible, hence \u201cChinggis Khan\u201d instead of \u201cGenghis Khan,\u201d\n\u201cWilhelm I\u201d instead of \u201cWilliam I,\u201d and \u201cNikolai I\u201d instead of \u201cNicholas I.\u201d Some exceptions have\nbeen made to avoid confusion where there is a prevailing English version, as in \u201cJosef Stalin\u201d\ninstead of the more accurate \u201cIosif Stalin.\u201d Diacritical marks are kept when possible in original\nspellings, as in the term \u201cF\u00fchrer\u201d when discussing Adolf Hitler. Herculean efforts have gone into\nreducing the number of semicolons throughout the text, to little avail.\nChristopher Brooks, Ph.D.\nFaculty Member in History, Portland Community College\nSecond Edition (Version 2.5): September 2021\n15 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nChapter 1: The Origins of Civilization\nIntroduction\nWhat is \u201ccivilization\u201d? In English, the word encompasses a wide variety of meanings,\noften implying a culture possessing some combination of learning, refinement, and political\nidentity. As described in the introductory chapter, it is also a \u201cloaded\u201d term, replete with an\nimplied division between civilization and its opposite, barbarism, with \u201ccivilized\u201d people often\neager to describe people who are of a different culture as being \u201cuncivilized\u201d in so many words.\nFortunately, more practical and value-neutral definitions of the term also exist. Civilization as a\nhistorical phenomenon speaks to certain foundational technologies, most significantly\nagriculture, combined with a high degree of social specialization, technological progress (albeit\nof a very slow kind in the case of the pre-modern world), and cultural sophistication as\nexpressed in art, learning, and spirituality.\nIn turn, the study of civilization has been the traditional focus of history, as an academic\ndiscipline, since the late nineteenth century. As academic fields became specialized over the\ncourse of the 1800s CE, history identified itself as the study of the past based on written\nartifacts. A sister field, archeology, developed as the study of the past based on non-written\nartifacts (such as the remains of bodies in grave sites, surviving buildings, and tools). Thus, for\npractical reasons, the subject of \u201chistory\u201d as a field of study begins with the invention of writing,\nsomething that began with the earliest civilization itself, that of the Fertile Crescent (described\nbelow). That being noted, history and archeology remain closely intertwined, especially since\nso few written records remain from the remote past that most historians of the ancient world also\nperform archeological research, and all archeologists are also at least conversant with the\nrelevant histories of their areas of study.\nHominids\nHuman beings are members of a species of hominid. The term \u201chominid\u201d refers to the\nbiological \u201cfamily\u201d that encompasses a number of species, including great apes and Homo\nSapiens. The earliest hominid ancestor of humankind was called Australopithecus: a biological\nspecies of African hominid that evolved about 3.9 million years ago. Australopithecus was\n16 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nsimilar to present-day chimpanzees, loping across the ground on all fours rather than standing\nupright, with brains about one-third the size of the modern human brain. They were the first to\ndevelop tool-making technology, chipping obsidian (volcanic glass) to make knives. From\nAustralopithecus, various other hominid species evolved, building on the genetic advantages of\nhaving a large brain and being able to craft simple tools.\nOne noteworthy descendent of Australopithecus was Homo erectus, which gets its name\nfrom the fact that it was the first hominid to walk upright. It also benefited from a brain\nthree-fourths the size of the modern human equivalent. Homo erectus developed more\nadvanced stone tool-making than had Australopithecus, and survived until about 200,000 years\nago, by which time the earliest Homo sapiens \u2013 humans \u2013 had long since evolved alongside\nthem.\nHomo sapiens emerged in a form biologically identical to present-day humankind by\nabout 300,000 years ago (fossil evidence frequently revises that number - the oldest known\nspecimen was discovered in Morocco in 2017). Armed with their unparalleled craniums, Homo\nsapiens created sophisticated bone and stone implements, including weapons and tools, and\nalso mastered the use of fire. They were thus able to hunt and protect themselves from animals\nthat had far better natural weapons, and (through cooking) eat foods that would have been\nindigestible raw. Likewise, animal skins served as clothes and shelter, allowing them to exist in\nclimates that they could not have settled otherwise.\nHomo sapiens was split between two distinct types, physically different but able to\ninterbreed, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens sapiens (the latter term means \u201cthe wisest man\u201d in\nGreek). Neanderthals enjoyed a long period of existence between about 400,000 and 70,000\nyears ago, spreading from Africa to the Middle East and Europe. They were physically larger\nand stronger than Homo sapiens sapiens and were able to survive in colder conditions, which\nwas a key asset during the long ice age that began around 100,000 years ago. Neanderthals\ncongregated in small groups, apparently interacting only to exchange breeding partners\n(naturally, we have no idea how these exchanges were negotiated - the evidence of their\nlifestyle is drawn from fossils and archeology).\nHomo sapiens sapiens were weaker and less able to deal with harsh conditions than\nneanderthals, staying confined to Africa for thousands of years after Neanderthals had spread\nto other regions. They did enjoy some key advantages, however, having longer limbs and\ncongregating in much larger groups of up to 100 individuals. A recent archeological discovery\n(in 2019) demonstrated that Homo sapiens sapiens reached Europe and the Near East by\n210,000 years ago, but that wave of migrants subsequently vanished. As conditions warmed by\n17 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nabout 70,000 years ago another wave of Homo sapiens sapiens spread to the Middle East and\nEurope and started both interbreeding with and - probably - slowly killing off the Neanderthals,\nwho vanished soon after. By that time, Homo sapiens sapiens was already in the process of\nspreading all over the world.\nOf the advanced hominids, only homo sapiens spread around the entire globe.\nThat massive global emigration was mostly complete by about 40,000 years ago. The\nlast lands to be inhabited were the Americas and Pacific Islands; the Americas were populated\nabout 15,000 years ago during another ice age, when humans traveled overland on the Bering\nLand Bridge, a chunk of land that used to connect eastern Russia to Alaska. Later, very\nenterprising ancient humans built seagoing canoes and settled in many of the Pacific Islands.\nThus, well before ancient humans had developed the essential technologies that are normally\nconnotated with civilization, they had already accomplished transcontinental and transoceanic\nvoyages and adapted to almost every climate on the planet.\nLikewise, the absence of advanced technologies was not an impediment to the attempt\nto understand the world. One astonishing outgrowth of Homo sapiens\u2019 brain power was the\ncreation of both art and spirituality. Early Homo sapiens painted on the walls of caves, most\nfamously in what is today southern France, and at some point they also began the practice of\nburying the dead in prepared grave sites, indicating that they believed that the spirit somehow\nsurvived physical death. Artifacts that have survived from prehistory clearly indicate that Homo\nsapiens was not only creating physical tools to prosper, but creating art and belief systems in an\nattempt to make sense of the world at a higher level than mere survival.\n18 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nPart of the Lascaux cave paintings in southern France.\nCivilization and Agriculture\nThus, human beings have existed all over the world for many thousands of years.\nHuman civilization, however, has not. The word civilization is tied to the Latin (the language of\nthe ancient Romans) word for city, as are related words like \u201ccivic\u201d and \u201ccivil.\u201d The key element\nof the definition is the idea that a large number of people come together in a group that is too\nlarge to consist only of an extended family group. Once large groups had formed, other\ndiscoveries and developments, from writing to mathematics to organized religion, followed.\nUp until that point in history, however, cities had not been possible because there was\nnever enough food to sustain a large group that stayed in a single place for long. Ancient\nhumans were hunter-gatherers. They followed herds of animals on the hunt and they gathered\nedible plants as well. This way of life fundamentally worked for hundreds of thousands of years\n- it was the basis of life for the very people who populated the world as described above. The\nproblem with the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, however, is that it is extremely precarious: there is\nnever a significant surplus of caloric energy, that is, of food, and thus population levels among\n19 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nhunting-gathering people were generally static. There just was not enough food to sustain\nsignificant population growth.\nStarting around 9,500 BCE, humans in a handful of regions around the world discovered\nagriculture, that is, the deliberate cultivation of edible plants. People discovered that certain\nseeds could be planted and crops could be reliably grown. Sometimes after that, people in the\nsame regions began to domesticate animals, keeping herds of cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats in\ncontrolled conditions, defending them from predators, and eating them and using their hides. It\nis impossible to overstate how important these changes were. Even fairly primitive agriculture\ncan produce fifty times more caloric energy than hunting and gathering does. The very basis of\nhuman life is how much energy we can derive from food; with agriculture and animal\ndomestication, it was possible for families to grow much larger and overall population levels to\nrise dramatically.\nOne of the noteworthy aspects of this transition is that hunting-gathering people actually\nhad much more leisure time than farmers did (and were also healthier and longer-lived).\nArchaeologists and anthropologists have determined that hunter-gatherer people generally only\n\u201cworked\u201d for a few hours a day, and spent the rest of their time in leisure activities. Meanwhile,\nfarmers have always worked incredibly hard for very long hours; in many places in the ancient\nworld, there were groups of people who remained hunter-gatherers despite knowing about\nagriculture, and it is quite possible they did that because they saw no particular advantage in\nadopting agriculture. There were also many areas that practiced both \u2013 right up until the\nmodern era, many farmers also foraged in areas of semi-wilderness near their farms.\nAgriculture was developed in a few different places completely independently. According\nto archeological evidence, agriculture did not start in one place and then spread; it started in a\nfew distinct areas and then spread from those areas, sometimes meeting in the middle. For\nexample, agriculture developed independently in China by 5000 BCE, and of course agriculture\nin the Americas (starting in western South America) had nothing to do with its earlier invention in\nthe Fertile Crescent.\nThe most important regions for the development of Western Civilization were\nMesopotamia and Egypt, because it was from those regions that the different technologies,\nempires, and ideas that came together in Western Civilization were forged. Thus, it is important\nto emphasize that the original heartland of Western Civilization was not in Greece or anywhere\nelse in Europe; it was in the Middle East and North Africa. Many of the different elements of\nWestern Civilization, things like scientific inquiry, the religions of the book (Judaism, Christianity,\n20 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nand Islam), engineering, and mathematics, were originally conceived in Mesopotamia and\nEgypt.\nThe earliest sites of agriculture emerged in the Fertile Crescent, the region encompassing Egypt\nalong the Nile river, the Near East, and Mesopotamia\n21 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nEarly agriculture, the kind of agriculture that made later advances in civilization possible,\nconsisted of people simply planting seeds by hand or with shovels and picks. There were some\nimportant technological discoveries that took place over time that allowed much greater crop\nyields, however. They included:\n1. Crop rotation, which people discovered sometime around 8000 BCE. Crop rotation is\nthe process of planting a different kind of crop in a field each year, then \u201crotating\u201d to the\nnext field in the next year. Every few years, a field is allowed to \u201clie fallow,\u201d meaning\nnothing is planted and animals can graze on it. This process serves to return nutrients to\nthe soil that would otherwise be leached out by successive years of planting, and it\ngreatly increases yields overall.\n2. The metal plow, which people invented around 5000 BCE. Plows are hugely important;\nthey opened up areas to cultivation that would be too rocky or the soil too hard to\nsupport crops normally.\n3. Irrigation, which happened in an organized fashion sometime around the same time in\nMesopotamia.\nThe early civilization of Mesopotamia consisted of fairly small farming communities. A\ncommon theory is that they may have originally came together in order to coordinate the need\nfor irrigation systems; the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are notorious for flooding unpredictably, so\nit took a lot of human effort to create the dikes and canals necessary to divert floodwaters and\nirrigate the farmlands near the rivers. Recent archaeological evidence suggests other motives,\nhowever, including the need for protection from rival groups and access to natural resources\nthat were concentrated in a specific area.\nOf the areas in which agriculture developed, the Fertile Crescent enjoyed significant\nadvantages. Many nutritious staple crops like wheat and barley grew naturally in the region.\nSeveral of the key animal species that were first domesticated by humans were also native to\nthe region, including goats, sheep, and cows. The region was also much more temperate and\nfertile than it is today, and the transition from hunting and gathering to large-scale farming was\npossible in Mesopotamia in a way that it was not in most other regions of the ancient world.\nThe food surplus that agriculture made possible in the Fertile Crescent eventually led to\nthe emergence of the first large settlements. Some of the earliest that were large enough to\nqualify as towns were Jericho in Palestine, which existed by about 8000 BCE, and \u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck\nin Turkey, which existed by about 7500 BCE. There were certainly many others in the Fertile\nCrescent, but due to their antiquity the remains of only a few - Jericho and \u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck most\nimportantly - have survived to be studied by archaeologists.\n22 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nFrom their remains it becomes possible to piece together certain facts about ancient\nsocieties on the cusp of civilization. First, it is clear that the earliest settlements (already) had\nsocial divisions. Hunter-gatherer societies have very few social divisions; there may be chiefs\nand shamans, but all members of the group are roughly equal in social power. One of the traits\nof civilization is the increasing complexity of social divisions, and with them, of social hierarchy.\nIn \u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck, tombs have revealed that some people were buried with jewelry and wealth,\nwhile others were buried with practically nothing. It is very clear that even at such an ancient\ntime, there were already major divisions between rich and poor.\nThat wealth was based on access to natural resources. \u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck was built on a site\nthat had a large deposit of obsidian (also called volcanic glass). Obsidian could be chipped to\ncreate extremely sharp tools and weapons. Tools made from \u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck's obsidian have been\ndiscovered by archaeologists hundreds of miles from \u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck itself; thus, it is clear that\n\u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck was already part of long-distance trade networks, trading obsidian for other goods\nwith other towns and villages. In essence, \u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck's trade in obsidian proves that\nspecialized manufacturing (in this case, of obsidian tools) and trade networks have been around\nsince the dawn of civilization itself.\nIn turn, the social divisions revealed in \u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck\u2019s graves reveal another key aspect\nof civilization: specialization. Social divisions themselves are only possible when there is a food\nsurplus. If everyone has to work all the time to get enough food, there is little time left over for\nanyone to specialize in other activities. The reason that hunter-gatherer societies produce little\nin the way of scholarship or technology is that they do not have the resources for people to\nspecialize in those areas. When agriculture made a food surplus possible for the first time in\nhistory, however, not everyone had to work on getting enough food, and soon, certain people\nmanaged to lay claim to new areas of expertise. Even in a settlement as ancient as \u00c7atal\nH\u00f6y\u00fck, there were craftsmen, builders, and perhaps most interestingly, priests. In the ruins of\nthe settlement archaeologists have found dozens of shrines to ancient gods and evidence of\nthere being a priesthood.\nThe existence of a priesthood and organized worship in \u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck is striking, because\nit means that people were trying in a systematic way to understand how the world worked. In\nturn, priests were probably the world's first intellectuals, people who use their minds for a living.\nPriests probably directed the efforts to build irrigation systems and made the decisions about\nbuilding and rebuilding the town since they had a monopoly on explaining the larger forces at\nwork in human life. Especially in a period like the ancient past when natural forces \u2013 forces like\n23 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nfloods and disease - were vastly more powerful than the ability of humans to control them,\npriests were the only people who could offer an explanation.\nNot just in Mesopotamia, but all around the ancient world, there is significant evidence of\nreligious belief systems centered on two major themes: fertility and death. One example of this\nare the \u201cVenus figurines\u201d depicting pregnant women with exaggerated physical features. Similar\nfigures can be seen from all over the ancient Middle East and Europe, demonstrating that\nancient peoples hoped to shape the forces that were most important to them. Early religions\nhoped to ensure fertility and stave off the many natural disasters that ancient peoples had no\ncontrol over.\nAn example of a \u201cVenus figurine\u201d excavated at \u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck.\n24 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe earliest surviving work of literature in the world, the Mesopotamian story known as\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, was obsessed with the theme of human mortality. Ancient peoples\nalready sensed that human beings were in the process of accomplishing things that had never\nbeen accomplished before, namely the construction of large settlements, the creation of new\ntechnologies, and the invention of organized religions, and yet they also sensed that the human\nexperience could be fraught with misery, despair, and what seemed like totally unfair and\narbitrary disasters. And, as the Epic of Gilgamesh demonstrates, ancient peoples were well\naware that no matter how great the accomplishments of a person during life, that person would\ninevitably die. That concern \u2013 the challenge of making sense of human existence in the face of\ndeath \u2013 is sometimes referred to by philosophers as \u201cthe human condition,\u201d and it is one that\nancient peoples grappled with in their religious systems.\nMesopotamia\nMesopotamia, on the eastern end of the Fertile Crescent, was the cradle of Western\nCivilization. It has the distinction of being the very first place on earth in which the development\nof agriculture led to the emergence of the essential technologies of civilization. In addition to\nmany great scientific advances such as mathematics, astronomy, and engineering, political\nnetworks and forms of organization like kingdoms, empires, and bureaucracy all originated in\nMesopotamia.\nMesopotamia is a region in present-day Iraq. The word Mesopotamia is Greek, meaning\n\u201cbetween the rivers,\u201d and it refers to the area between the Tigris and Euphrates, two of the most\nimportant waterways in the ancient world. It is no coincidence that it was here that civilization\nwas born: like nearby Egypt and the Nile river, early agriculture relied on a regular supply of\nwater in a highly fertile region. The ancient Mesopotamians had everything they needed for\nagriculture, they just had to figure out how to cultivate cereals and grains (natural varieties of\nwhich naturally occurred in the area, as noted above) and how to manage the sudden floods of\nboth rivers.\nMesopotamia\u2019s climate was much more temperate and fertile than it is today. There is a\ngreat deal of evidence (e.g. in ancient art, in archeological discoveries of ancient settlements,\netc.) that Mesopotamia was once a grassland that could support both large herds of animals\nand abundant crops. Thus, between the water provided by the rivers and their tributaries, the\ntemperate climate, and the prevalence of the plant and animal species in the area that were\n25 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ncandidates for domestication, Mesopotamia was better suited to agriculture than practically any\nother region on the planet.\nWhile the Tigris and Euphrates provided abundant water, they were highly unpredictable\nand given to periodic flooding. The southern region of Mesopotamia, Sumer, has an elevation\ndecline of only 50 meters over about 500 kilometers of distance, meaning the riverbeds of both\nrivers would have shifted and spread out over the plains in the annual floods. Over time, the\ninhabitants of villages realized that they needed to work together to build larger-scale levees,\ncanals, and dikes to protect against the floods. One theory regarding the origins of large-scale\nsettlements is that when enough villages got together to work on these hydrological systems,\nthey needed some kind of leadership to direct the efforts, leading to systems of governance and\nadministration. Thus, the earliest cities in the world may have been born not just out of\nagriculture, but out of the need to manage the natural resource of water.\nThe first settlements that straddled the line between \u201ctowns\u201d and real \u201ccities\u201d existed\naround 4000 BCE, but a truly urban society in Mesopotamia was in place closer 3000 BCE,\nwherein a few dozen city-states managed the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates. A note on the\nchronology: the town of \u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck discussed above existed over four thousand years before\nthe first great cities in Mesopotamia. It is important to bear this in mind, because when\nconsidering ancient history (in this case, in a short chapter of a textbook), it can seem like it all\nhappened quite rapidly, that people discovered agriculture and soon they were building massive\ncities and developing advanced technology. That simply was not the case: compared to the\nhundreds of thousands of years preceding the discovery of agriculture, things moved \u201cquickly,\u201d\nbut from a modern perspective, it took a very long time for things to change.\nOne compelling theory about the period between the invention of agriculture and the\nemergence of large cities (again, between about 8,000 BCE and 4000 BCE) is that a hybrid\nlifestyle of farming and gathering appears to have been very common in the large wetlands\nalong the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris. Given the richness of dietary options in the region\nat the time, people lived in small communities for millenia without feeling compelled to build\nlarger settlements. Somehow, however, a regime eventually emerged that imposed a new form\nof social organization and hierarchy, introducing taxation, large-scale building projects, and\nunfree labor (i.e. both slavery and forms of indentured labor). In turn, this appears to have\noccurred in the areas that grew cereal grains like wheat and barley extensively, because cereal\ngrains were easy to collect and store, making them easy to tax.\nAs a result of these new hierarchies, the first true cities emerged in the southern region\nof Sumer. There, the two rivers join in a large delta that flows into the Persian Gulf. Further up\n26 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthe rivers, the northern region of Mesopotamia was known as Akkad. The division is both\ngeographical and lingual: ancient Sumerian is not related to any modern language, but the\nAkkadian family of languages was Semitic, related to modern languages like Arabic and\nHebrew. Urban civilization eventually flourished in both regions, starting in Sumer but quickly\nspreading north.\nOne early Sumerian city was Uruk, which was a large city by 3500 BCE. Uruk had about\n50,000 people in the city itself and the surrounding region. It was a major center for\nlong-distance trade, with its trade networks stretching all across the Middle East and as far east\nas the Indus river valley of India, with merchants relying on caravans of donkeys and the use of\nwheeled carts. Trade linked Mesopotamia and Anatolia (the region of present-day Turkey) as\nwell. The economy of Uruk was what historians call \u201credistributive,\u201d in which a central authority\nhas the right to control all economic activity, essentially taxing all of it, and then re-distributing it\nas that authority sees fit. Practically speaking, this entailed the collection of foodstuffs and\nwealth by each city-state\u2019s government, which then used it to \u201cpay\u201d (sometimes in daily\nallotments of food and beer) workers tasked with constructing walls, roads, temples, and\npalaces.\n27 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe influence of Sumerian civilization was felt all over the Mesopotamian region. The above\nmap depicts the \u201cUrukean expansion,\u201d a period in the fourth millennium BCE in which Sumerian\nmaterial culture (and presumably Sumerian people) spread hundreds of miles from Sumer itself.\nPolitical leaders in ancient Mesopotamia appear to have been drawn from both\npriesthoods and the warrior elite, with the two classes working closely together in governing the\ncities. Each Mesopotamian city was believed to be \u201cowned\u201d by a patron god, a deity that\nwatched over it and would respond to prayers if they were properly made and accompanied by\nrituals and sacrifices. The priests of Uruk predicted the future and explained the present in\nterms of the will of the gods, and they claimed to be able to influence the gods through their\nrituals. They claimed all of the economic output of Uruk and its trade network because the city\u2019s\n28 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\npatron god \u201cowned\u201d the city, which justified the priesthood's control. They not only taxed the\nwealth, the crops, and the goods of the subjects of Uruk, but they also had a right to demand\nlabor, requiring the common people (i.e. almost everyone) to work on the irrigation systems, the\ntemples, and the other major public buildings.\nMeanwhile, the first kings were almost certainly war leaders who led their city-states\nagainst rival city-states and against foreign invaders. They soon ascended to positions of\npolitical power in their cities, working with the priesthood to maintain control over the common\npeople. The Mesopotamian priesthood endorsed the idea that the gods had chosen the kings to\nrule, a belief that quickly bled over into the idea that the kings were at least in part divine\nthemselves. In fact, one of the earliest terms for \u201cking\u201d was ensis, meaning the representative of\nthe god who \u201creally\u201d ruled the city. Thus, the typical early Mesopotamian city-state, right around\n2500 BCE, was a city-state engaged in long-distance trade, and ruled by a king who worked\nclosely with the city's priesthood and who frequently made war against his neighbors.\nBelief, Thought, and Learning\nThe Mesopotamians believed that the gods were generally cruel, capricious, and easily\noffended. Humans had been created by the gods not to enjoy life, but to toil, and the gods\nwould inflict pain and suffering on humans whenever they (the gods) were offended. A major\nelement of the power of the priesthood in the Mesopotamian cities was the fact that the priests\nclaimed to be able to soothe and assuage the gods, to prevent the gods from sending yet\nanother devastating flood, epidemic, or plague of locusts. It is not too far off to say that the most\nimportant duty of Mesopotamian priests was to beg the gods for mercy.\nAll of the Mesopotamian cities worshiped the same gods, referred to as the\nMesopotamian pantheon (pantheon means \u201cgroup of gods.\u201d) As noted above, each city had its\nown specific patron deity who \u201cowned\u201d and took particular interest in the affairs of that city. By\nabout 3,000 BCE, in the center of each city was a huge temple called a ziggurat, or\nstep-pyramid, a few of which still survive today. Unlike the Egyptian pyramids that came later,\nMesopotamian ziggurats were not tombs, but temples, and as such they were the centerpieces\nof the great cities. They were not just the centers of worship, but were also banks and\nworkshops, with the priests overseeing the exchange of wealth and the production of crafts.\nAlongside the development of religious belief, science made major strides in\nMesopotamian civilization. The Mesopotamians were the first great astronomers, accurately\nmapping the movement of the stars and recording them in star charts. They invented functional\n29 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nwagons and chariots and, as seen in the case of both ziggurats and irrigation systems, they\nwere excellent engineers. They also invented the 360 degrees used to measure angles in\ngeometry and they were the first to divide a system of timekeeping that used a 60-second\nminute. Finally, they developed a complex and accurate system of arithmetic that would go on\nto form the basis of mathematics as it was used and understood throughout the ancient\nMediterranean world.\nAt the same time, however, the Mesopotamians employed \u201cmagical\u201d practices. The\npriests did not just conduct sacrifices to the gods, they practiced the art of divination: the\npractice of trying to predict the future. To them, magic and science were all aspects of the same\npursuit, namely trying to learn about how the universe functioned so that human beings could\ninfluence it more effectively. From the perspective of the ancient Mesopotamians, there was\nlittle that distinguished religious and magical practices from \u201creal\u201d science in the modern sense.\nTheir goals were the same, and the Mesopotamians actively experimented to develop both\nsystems in tandem.\nThe Mesopotamians also invented the first systems of writing, first developed in order to\nkeep track of tax records sometime around 3000 BCE. Their style of writing is called cuneiform;\nit started out as a pictographic system in which each word or idea was represented by a symbol,\nbut it eventually changed to include both pictographs and syllabic symbols (i.e. symbols that\nrepresent a sound instead of a word). While it was originally used just for record-keeping,\nwriting soon evolved into the creation of true forms of literature.\nAn example of cuneiform script, carved into a stone tablet, dating from c. 2400 BCE.\nThe first known author in history whose name and some of whose works survive was a\nSumerian high priestess, Enheduanna. Daughter of the great conqueror Sargon of Akkad\n30 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\n(described below), Enheduanna served as the high priestess of the goddess Inanna and the\ngod of the moon, Nanna, in the city of Ur after its conquest by Sargon\u2019s forces. Enheduanna\nwrote a series of hymns to the gods that established her as the earliest poet in recorded history,\npraising Inanna and, at one point, asking for the aid of the gods during a period of political\nturmoil.\nEnheduanna did not record the first known work of prose, however, whose author or\nauthors remain unknown. Remembered as The Epic of Gilgamesh, the earliest surviving work of\nliterature, it is the best known of the surviving Mesopotamian stories. The Epic describes the\nadventures of a partly-divine king of the city of Uruk, Gilgamesh, who is joined by his friend\nEnkidu as they fight monsters, build great works, and celebrate their own power and greatness.\nEnkidu is punished by the gods for their arrogance and he dies. Gilgamesh, grief-stricken, goes\nin search of immortality when he realizes that he, too, will someday die. In the end, immortality\nis taken from him by a serpent, and humbled, he returns to Uruk a wiser, better king.\nLike Enheduanna\u2019s hymns, which reveal at times her own personality and concerns, The\nEpic of Gilgamesh is a fascinating story in that it speaks to a very sophisticated and\nrecognizable set of issues: the qualities that make a good leader, human failings and frailty, the\npower and importance of friendship, and the unfairness of fate. Likewise, a central focus of the\nepic is Gilgamesh's quest for immortality when he confronts the absurdity of death. Death\u2019s\nseeming unfairness is a distinctly philosophical concern that demonstrates an advanced\nengagement with human nature and the human condition present in Mesopotamian society.\nAlong with literature, the other great written accomplishments of the Mesopotamians\nwere their systems of law. The most substantial surviving law code is that of the Babylonian\nking Hammurabi, dating from about 1780 BCE. Hammurabi's law code went into great detail\nabout the rights and obligations of Babylonians. It drew legal distinctions between the \u201cfree\nmen\u201d or aristocratic citizens, commoners, and slaves, treating the same crimes very differently.\nThe laws speak to a deep concern with fairness \u2013 the code tried to protect people from unfair\nterms on loans, it provided redress for damaged property, it even held city officials responsible\nfor catching criminals. Justice as detailed in Hammurabi\u2019s code famously assigned punishments\nfor specific crimes, which included the death penalty and mutilation among other forms of\nretribution (e.g. \u201cIf a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out\u201d). It also\nincluded legal protections for women in various ways. While women were unquestionably\nsecondary to men in their legal status, the Code still afforded them more rights and protections\nthan did many codes of law that emerged thousands of years later.\n31 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nWar and Empire\nMesopotamia presents the earliest indications of large-scale warfare. Mesopotamian\ncities always had walls \u2013 some of which were 30 feet high and 60 feet wide, essentially\nenormous piles of earth strengthened by brick. The evidence (based on pictures and\ninscriptions) suggests, however, that most soldiers were peasant conscripts with little or no\narmor and light weapons. In these circumstances, defense almost always won out over offense,\nmaking the actual conquest of foreign cities very difficult if not impossible, and hence while cities\nwere around for thousands of years (again, from about 3500 BCE), there were no empires yet.\nCities warred on one another for territory, captives, and riches, but they rarely succeeded in\nconquering other cities outright. War was instead primarily about territorial raids and perhaps\nnoble combats meant to demonstrate strength and power.\nOver the course of the third millennium BCE, chariots became increasingly important in\nwarfare. Early chariots were four-wheeled carts that were clumsy and hard to maneuver. They\nwere still very effective against hapless peasants with spears, however, so it appears that when\nrival Mesopotamian city-states fought actual battles, they consisted largely of massed groups of\nchariots carrying archers who shot at each other. Noble charioteers and archers could win glory\nfor their skill, even though these battles were probably not very lethal (compared to later forms\nof war, at any rate).\nThe first time that a single military leader managed to conquer and unite many of the\nMesopotamian cities was in about 2340 BCE, when the king Sargon the Great, also known as\nSargon of Akkad (father of Enheduanna, described above), conquered almost all of the major\nMesopotamian cities and forged the world's first true empire, in the process uniting the regions\nof Akkad and Sumer. His empire appears to have held together for about another century, until\nsomewhere around 2200 BCE. Sargon also created the world's first standing army, a group of\nsoldiers employed by the state who did not have other jobs or duties. One inscription claims\nthat \u201c5,400 soldiers ate daily in his palace,\u201d and there are contemporaneous illustrations not only\nof soldiers, but of siege weapons and mining (digging under the walls of enemy fortifications to\ncause them to collapse).\n32 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe expansion of Sargon\u2019s empire, which eventually stretched from present-day Lebanon to\nSumer.\nSargon himself was born an illegitimate child and was, at one point, a royal gardener\nwho worked his way up in the palace, eventually seizing power in a coup. He boasted about his\nlowly origins and claimed to protect and represent the interests of common people and\nmerchants. Sargon appointed governors in his conquered cities, and his whole empire was\ndesigned to extract wealth from all of its cities and farmlands and pump it back to the capital of\nAkkad, which he built somewhere near present-day Baghdad. While his descendents did their\nbest to hold on to power, the resentment of the subject cities eventually resulted in the empire\u2019s\ncollapse.\nThe next major Mesopotamian empire was the \u201cUr III\u201d dynasty, named after the city-state\nof Ur which served as its capital and founded in about 2112 BCE. Just as Sargon had, the king\nUr-Nammu conquered and united most of the city-states of Mesopotamia. The most important\nhistorical legacy of the Ur III dynasty was its complex system of bureaucracy, which was more\neffective in governing the conquered cities than Sargon\u2019s rule had been.\nBureaucracy (which literally means \u201crule by office\u201d) is one of the most underappreciated\nphenomena in history, probably because the concept is not particularly exciting to most people.\nThe fact remains that there is no more efficient way yet invented to manage large groups of\npeople: it was viable to coordinate small groups through the personal control and influence of a\nfew individuals, but as cities grew and empires formed, it became untenable to have everything\n33 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nboil down to personal relationships. An efficient bureaucracy, one in which the individual people\nwho were part of it were less important than the system itself (i.e. its rules, its records, and its\nchain of command), was always essential in large political units.\nThe Ur III dynasty is an example of an early bureaucratic empire. Historians have more\nrecords of this dynasty than any other from this period of ancient Mesopotamia thanks to its\nfocus on codifying its regulations. The kings of Ur III were very adept at playing off their civic\nand military leaders against each other, appointing generals to direct troops in other cities and\nmaking sure that each governor's power relied on his loyalty to the king. The administration of\nthe Ur III dynasty divided the empire into three distinct tax regions, and its tax bureaucracy\ncollected wealth without alienating the conquered peoples as much as Sargon and his\ndescendants had (despite its relative success, Ur III, too, eventually collapsed, although it was\ndue to a foreign invasion rather than an internal revolt).\nFinally, there was the great empire of Hammurabi (which lasted from 1792 \u2013 1595 BCE),\nthe author of the code of laws noted above. By about 1780 BCE, Hammurabi conquered many\nof the city-states near Babylon in the heart of Mesopotamia. He was not only concerned with\nlaws, but also with ensuring the economic prosperity of his empire; while it is impossible to know\nhow sincere he was about it, he wanted to be remembered as a kind of benevolent dictator who\nlooked after his subjects. The Babylonian empire re-centered Mesopotamia as a whole on\nBabylon. It lasted until 1595 BCE when it was defeated by an empire from Anatolia known as\nthe Hittites.\nWhat all of these ancient empires had in common beyond a common culture was that\nthey were very precarious. Their bureaucracies were not large enough or organized enough to\nmanage large populations easily, and rebellions were frequent. There was also the constant\nthreat of what the surviving texts refer to as \u201cbandits,\u201d which in this context means the same\nthing as \u201cbarbarians.\u201d To the north of Mesopotamia are the great steppes of Central Asia, the\nsource of limitless and almost nonstop invasions throughout ancient history. Nomads from the\nsteppe regions were the first to domesticate horses, and for thousands of years only steppe\npeoples knew how to fight directly from horseback instead of using chariots. Thus, the rulers of\nthe Mesopotamian city-states and empires all had to contend with policing their borders against\na foe they could not pursue, while still maintaining control over their own cities.\nThis precarity was responsible for the fact that these early empires were not especially\nlong-lasting, and were unable to conquer territory outside of Mesopotamia itself. What came\nafterwards were the first early empires that, through a combination of governing techniques,\nbeliefs, and technology, were able to grow much larger and more powerful.\n34 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nImage Citations (Wikimedia Commons):\nHomo sapiens map - NordNordWest\nLascaux painting - Prof saxx\nFertile crescent map - NormanEinstein\nVenus figurine - Nevit Dilmen\nSumerian expansion map - S\u00e9mhur\nCuneiform - Salvor\nSargon map - Nareklm\n35 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nChapter 2: Egypt\nAs noted in the last chapter, the Mesopotamians regarded the gods as cruel and\narbitrary and thought that human existence was not a very pleasant experience. This attitude\nwas not only shaped by all of the things that ancient people did not understand, like disease,\nweather, and death itself, but by the simple fact that it was often difficult to live next to the Tigris\nand Euphrates rivers, which flooded unpredictably and necessitated constant work in order to\nbe useful for irrigation. Likewise, the threat of invasion from both rival cities and from foreigners\n(both \u201cbarbarians\u201d and more organized groups) threatened to disrupt whatever stability existed.\nLife for most Mesopotamians, especially the vast majority who were common farmers, was not\neasy.\nThings were a bit different in the other great ancient civilization of the eastern\nMediterranean: Egypt, whose civilization developed along the banks of the Nile river. The Nile\nis the world's longest river, stretching over 4,000 miles from its mouth in the Mediterranean to its\norigin in Lake Victoria in Central Africa. Because of consistent weather patterns, the Nile floods\nevery year at just about the same time (late summer), depositing enormous amounts of mud\nand silt along its banks and making it one of the most fertile regions in the world. The essential\nsource of energy for the Egyptians was thus something that could be predicted and planned for\nin a way that was impossible in Mesopotamia. There is a direct connection between this\npredictability and the incredible stability of Egyptian civilization, which (despite new kings and\nnew dynasties and the occasional foreign invasion) remained remarkably stable and consistent\nfor thousands of years.\nThe Egyptians themselves called the Nile valley \u201cKemet,\u201d the Black Land, because of the\nannually-renewed black soil that arrived with the flood. For the most part, this was ancient\nEgypt: a swath of land between 10 and 20 miles wide (and in some places merely 1 or 2 miles\nwide) made up of incredibly fertile soil that relied on the floods of the Nile. This land was so\nagriculturally productive that Egyptian peasants could bring in harvests three times as bountiful\nof those in other regions like Mesopotamia. In turn, this created an enormous surplus of wealth\nfor the royal government, which had the right to tax and redistribute it (as did the Mesopotamian\nstates to the east). Beyond that strip of land were deserts populated by people the Egyptians\nsimply dismissed as \u201cbandits\u201d \u2013 meaning nomads and tribal groups, not just robbers.\n36 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nAncient Egypt\u2019s Old Kingdom came into being with the unification of Lower Egypt, where the\nNile empties into the Mediterranean, and Upper Egypt, where the Nile leads into Nubia\n(present-day Sudan).\nThere were three major periods in ancient Egyptian history, the time during which Egypt\nwas not subject to foreign powers and during which it developed its distinctive culture and built\nits spectacular examples of monumental architecture: the Old Kingdom (2680 \u2013 2200 BCE), the\nMiddle Kingdom (2040 \u2013 1720 BCE), and the New Kingdom (1550 \u2013 1150 BCE). There were\nalso two \u201cintermediate periods\u201d between the Old and Middle Kingdoms (The First Intermediate\nPeriod, 2200 \u2013 2040 BCE) and Middle and New Kingdoms (The Second Intermediate Period,\n37 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\n1720 \u2013 1550 BCE). These were periods during which the political control of the ruling dynasty\nbroke down and rival groups fought for control. The very large overarching story of ancient\nEgyptian history is that each of the different major kingdoms was quite stable and relatively\npeaceful, while the intermediary periods were troubled, violent, and chaotic. The remarkable\nthing about the history overall is the simple fact of its longevity; even compared to other ancient\ncultures (Mesopotamia, for instance), Egyptian politics were incredibly consistent.\nThe concept of these different periods was created by Manetho, an Egyptian priest who,\nin about 300 BCE, recorded the \u201cdefinitive\u201d history of the ancient kings and created the very\nnotion of the old, middle, and new kingdoms. While that periodization overlooks some of the\nspecifics of Egyptian history, it is still the preferred method for dating ancient Egypt to this day\nbecause of its simplicity and clarity.\nAlso, a note on nomenclature: the term \u201cpharaoh\u201d means \u201cgreat house,\u201d the term used\nfor the royal palace and its vast supporting bureaucracy. It came to be used to refer to the king\nhimself starting in the New Kingdom period; it would be as if the American president was called\n\u201cthe White House\u201d in everyday language. This chapter will use the term \u201cking\u201d for the kings of\nEgypt leading up to the New Kingdom, then \u201cpharaoh\u201d for the New Kingdom rulers to reflect the\naccurate use of the term.\nThe Political history of ancient Egypt\nEgypt was divided between \u201cUpper Egypt,\u201d the southern stretch of the Nile Valley that\nrelied on the Nile floods for irrigation, and \u201cLower Egypt,\u201d the enormous delta region where the\nNile meets the Mediterranean. The two regions had been politically distinct for centuries, but\n(according to both archeology and the dating system created by Manetho) in roughly 3100 BCE\nNarmer, a king of Upper Egypt, conquered Lower Egypt and united the country for the first time.\nThe date used for the founding of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, 2680 BCE, is when the third royal\ndynasty to rule all of Egypt established itself. Its king, Djoser, was the first to commission an\nenormous tomb to house his remains when he died: the first pyramid. The Old Kingdom\nrepresented a long, unbroken line of kings that presided over the first full flowering of Egyptian\nculture, architecture, and prosperity.\nThe Old Kingdom united Egypt under a single ruling house, developed systems of\nrecord-keeping, and formed an all-important caste of scribes, the royal bureaucrats who\nmastered hieroglyphic writing. Likewise, the essential characteristics of Egyptian religion\nemerged during the Old Kingdom, especially the idea that the king was actually a god and that\n38 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nhis rule ensured that the world itself would continue \u2013 the Egyptians thought that if there was no\nking or the proper prayers were not recited by the priests, terrible chaos and destruction would\nreign on earth.\nThe Old Kingdom was stable and powerful, although its kings did not use that power to\nexpand their borders beyond Egypt itself. Instead, all of Old Kingdom society revolved around\nthe production of agricultural surpluses from the Nile, efficiently cataloged and taxed by the royal\nbureaucracy and \u201cspent\u201d on building enormous temples and, in time, tombs. The pyramids of\nEgypt were all built during the Old Kingdom, and their purpose was to house the bodies of the\nkings so that their spirits could travel to the land of the dead and join their fellow gods in the\nafterlife (thereby maintaining ma\u2019at - sacred order and balance).\nA present-day picture of the Great Pyramid, outside of Cairo.\nThe pyramids are justly famous as the ultimate example of Egyptian prosperity and\ningenuity. The Great Pyramid of Khufu, the single largest pyramid of the period, contained over\n2.5 million stone blocks, each weighing approximately 2.5 tons. The sheer amount of energy\nexpended on the construction of the pyramids is thus staggering; it was only the incredible\nbounty of the Nile and its harvests that enabled the construction of the pyramids by providing\nthe calories consumed by the workers and draught animals, the wealth used to employ the\n39 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nsupporting bureaucracy, and the size of the population that sustained the entire enterprise.\nLikewise, while the details are now lost, the Old Kingdom\u2019s government must have been highly\neffective at tax collection and the distribution of food, supplies, and work teams. Pyramids on\nthe scale of the Old Kingdom would have been all but impossible anywhere else in the world at\nthe time.\nA major factor in the stability of Old Kingdom Egypt was that it was very isolated.\nDespite its geographical proximity to Mesopotamia and Anatolia, Egypt at the time was largely\nseparated from the civilizations of those regions. The Sinai Peninsula, which divides Egypt from\npresent-day Palestine and Israel, is about 120 miles of desert. With a few violent exceptions, no\nmajor incursions were able to cross over Sinai, and contact with the cultures of Mesopotamia\nand the Near East was limited as a result. Likewise, even though Egypt is on the\nMediterranean, sailing technology was so primitive that there was little contact with other\ncultures via the sea.\nAround 2200 BCE, two hundred years after the last pyramids were built, the Old\nKingdom collapsed, leading to the First Intermediate Period. The reason for the collapse is not\nclear, but it probably had to do with the very infrequent occurrence of drought. There are written\nrecords from this period of instability, known as the First Intermediate Period, that make it clear\nthat Egyptians knew very well that things had been fundamentally upset and imbalanced, and\nthey did not know what to do about it. The kings were supposed to oversee the harmony of life\nand yet the royal dynasty had collapsed without a replacement. This disrupted the entire\nEgyptian worldview.\nIn turn, this disruption prompted a development in Egyptian religion. The Egyptian\nreligion of the Old Kingdom had emphasized life on earth; even though the pyramids were\ntombs built to house the kings and the things they would need on their journey to the afterlife,\nthere are no records with details about how most people would fare after they died. This\nchanged during the First Intermediate Period, when the Egyptians invented the idea that the\nsuffering of the present life might be overcome in a more perfect world to come. After death, the\nsoul would be brought before a judge of the gods, who would weigh the heart on scales against\nthe ideals of harmony and order. At this point, the heart might betray the soul, telling the god all\nof the sins its owner had committed in life. The lucky and virtuous person, though, would see\ntheir heart balance against the ideal of order and the soul would be rewarded with eternal life.\nOtherwise, their heart would be tossed to a crocodile-headed demon and devoured, the soul\nperishing in the process.\n40 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nMonumental building ceased during the Intermediate Period \u2013 there were no more\npyramids, palaces, or temples being built. A major social change that occurred was that royal\nofficials away from the capital started to inherit titles, and thus it was the first time there was a\nreal noble class with its own inherited power and land. Some historians have argued that a\nmajor cause of the collapse of royal authority was the growth in power of the nobility: in other\nwords, royal authority did not fall apart first and lead to elites seizing more power, elites seized\npower and thereby weakened royal authority. The irony of the period is that the economy of\nEgypt actually diversified and expanded. It seems to have been a time in which a new elite\ncommissioned royal-inspired goods and hence supported emerging craftspeople.\nThe Middle Kingdom was the next great Egyptian kingdom of the ancient world. The\ngovernor of the city of Thebes reunified the kingdom and established himself as the new king\n(Mentuhotep II, r. 2060 \u2013 2010 BCE). One major change in Egyptian belief is that the Middle\nKingdom rulers still claimed to be at least partly divine, but they also emphasized their humanity.\nThey wrote about themselves as shepherds trying to maintain the balance of harmony in Egypt\nand to protect their people, rather than just as lords over an immortal kingdom. Their nobles\nhad more power than had the nobility of the Old Kingdom as well, playing important political\nroles on their lands.\nStarting during the Middle Kingdom, the kings made a major effort to extend Egyptian\npower and influence beyond the traditional \u201ccore\u201d of the kingdom in Egypt itself. Egypt exerted\nmilitary power and extracted wealth from the northern part of the kingdom of Nubia (in\npresent-day Sudan) to the south, and also established at least limited ongoing contact with\nMesopotamia as well. The kings actively encouraged immigration from outside of Egypt, but\ninsisted that immigrants settle among Egyptians. They had the same policy with war captives,\noften settling them as farmers in the midst of Egyptians. This ensured speedy acculturation and\nhelped bring foreign talent into Egypt.\nWhile no more pyramids were ever built - it appears that the nearly obsessive focus on\nthe spirit of the king after death was confined to the Old Kingdom - the Middle Kingdom was\ndefinitely a period of stability and prosperity for Egypt as a whole. A fairly diverse body of\nliterature survived in the form of writings on papyrus, the form of paper made from Nile reeds\nmonopolized by Egypt for centuries, that suggests that commerce was extensive, Egyptian\nreligion celebrated the spiritual importance of ordinary people, and fairness and justice were\nregarded as major ethical imperatives.\nThings spun out of control for the Middle Kingdom starting in about 1720 BCE, roughly\n300 years after it had been founded, leading in turn to the Second Intermediate Period. Settlers\n41 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nfrom Canaan (present-day Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, and parts of Syria) had been streaming into\nEgypt for generations, initially settling and assimilating into Egyptian society. By about 1650\nBCE, however, a group of Canaanites founded what was known as the \u201cHyksos\u201d dynasty, an\nEgyptian term which simply means \u201cleaders of foreigners,\u201d after they overthrew the king and\nseized power in Lower Egypt. While they started as \u201cforeigners,\u201d the Hyksos quickly adopted\nthe practices of the Egyptian kings they had overthrown, using Egyptian scribes to keep records\nin hieroglyphics, worshiping the local gods, and generally behaving like Egyptians.\nThe most significant innovation introduced by the Hyksos was the use of bronze (it\nshould be noted that they introduced horses and chariots as well). There was very limited use\nof bronze in Egypt until the Second Intermediate Period, with both weapons and tools being\ncrafted from copper or stone. Bronze, an alloy of copper and zinc or nickel, required technical\nskill and access to its component minerals to craft. The finished product was far harder and\nmore durable than was copper alone, however, and with the advent of large-scale bronze use in\nEgypt thanks to the Hyksos, the possibilities for the growth of Egyptian power increased greatly.\nBronze had already been in use for over a thousand years by the time it became common in\nEgypt, but when it finally arrived with Canaanite craftsmen it radically altered the balance of\npower. Up to that point, Egyptian technology, especially in terms of metallurgy, was quite\nprimitive. Egyptian soldiers were often nothing more than peasants armed with copper knives,\nspears with copper heads, or even just clubs. Egypt's relative isolation meant that it had never\nneeded to develop more advanced weapons, a fact that the Hyksos were able to take\nadvantage of, belatedly bringing the large-scale use of bronze with them.\nIn 1550 BCE, the Second Intermediate Period ended when another Egyptian king,\nAhmose I, expelled the Hyksos from Egypt. Thus began the New Kingdom, the most powerful\nto date. This was also when the Egyptian kings started calling themselves pharaohs, which\nmeans \u201cgreat house,\u201d lord over all things. Using the new bronze military technology, the New\nKingdom was (at times) able to expand Egyptian control all the way into Mesopotamia. Bronze\nwas the key factor, but also important was the adoption of composite bows: bows that are made\nfrom strips of animal bone and sinew, glued together. A composite bow was much more\npowerful than a wooden one, and they greatly enhanced the power of the Egyptian military.\nLikewise, again thanks to the Hyksos, the New Kingdom was able to employ chariots in war for\nthe first time. One in ten men was impressed into military service, supplemented with auxiliaries\nfrom conquered lands as well as mercenary forces.\nWhile the Egyptians had always considered themselves to be the favored people of the\ngods, dwelling in the home of spiritual harmony in the universe, it was really during the New\n42 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nKingdom that they actively campaigned to take over foreign lands. The idea was that divine\nharmony existed only in Egypt and had to be brought to the rest of the world, by force if\nnecessary. By 1500 BCE, only 50 years after the founding of the new kingdom, Egypt had\nconquered Canaan and much of Syria. It then conquered northern Nubia. The pharaohs\ndispatched communities of Egyptians to settle conquered lands, both to pacify those lands and\nto exploit natural resources in order to increase royal revenue.\nThe New Kingdom pharaohs enlisted the leaders of the lands they had conquered as\npuppet kings, surrounded by Egyptian advisors. The pharaohs adopted the practice of bringing\nmany foreign princes of the lands they had conquered back to Egypt. There, a prince would be\nraised as an Egyptian and educated to think of Egyptian civilization as both superior to others\nand their own. Thus, when they returned to rule after their fathers died, these princes would\noften be thoroughly assimilated to Egyptian culture and would naturally be more loyal to the\npharaoh; using this technique, the New Kingdom was able to create several \u201cpuppet states,\u201d\nplaces with their own rulers who were loyal to Egypt, in the Near and Middle East.\nThe New Kingdom was also the great bureaucratic empire of Egypt. The pharaohs\ndivided Egypt into two administrative regions: Upper Egypt, up the Nile and governed from the\ncity of Thebes, and Lower Egypt, near the Nile delta where it drained into the Mediterranean\nand ruled from the city of Memphis. Regional administrators did the important work of drafting\nlaborers, extracting taxation, and making sure that agriculture was on track. A single royal\nofficial of vast personal power, the vizier, supervised the whole system and personally decided\nwhen to open the locks on the Nile to allow the floodwaters out each year.\nWhile royal officials and the priesthoods of the gods held significant power and influence\nduring the New Kingdom, the king (now known as the pharaoh) still ruled as a living god. The\npharaohs were still thought to be divine, but that did not mean they simply bullied their subjects.\nMany letters have survived between pharaohs and their subordinates, as well as between\npharaohs and other kings in foreign lands. They played tax breaks, gifts, and benefits off to\nencourage loyalty to Egypt rather than simply threatening people with divine power or armies.\nIn addition to the New Kingdom\u2019s expansionism, the governments pursued new forms of\nmonumental architecture. While the construction of pyramids never occurred after the Old\nKingdom, Egyptian kings remained focused on the creation of great buildings. They continued\nto build opulent tombs, but those were usually built into hillsides or in more conventional\nstructures, rather than pyramids. The monumental architecture of the New Kingdom consisted\nof huge temples and statues, most notably the Great Temple at Abu Simbel in northern Nubia,\nbuilt under the direction of the pharaoh Ramses II at some point around 1250 BCE. There,\n43 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ngigantic statues of the gods sit, and twice a year, the rising sun shines through the entrance and\ndirectly illuminates three of them, while the god of the underworld remains in shadow.\nThe imposing entrance to the Great Temple of Abu Simbel.\nDetailed records of noteworthy pharaohs survive from the New Kingdom. The New\nKingdom saw the only known female pharaoh, a woman who ruled from 1479 to 1458 BCE.\nHer name was Hatshepsut; she originally ruled as a regent (i.e. someone who is supposed to\nrule until the young king comes of age) for her stepson, but then claimed the title of pharaoh and\nruled outright. She ruled for 20 years, waged war, and oversaw a period of ongoing prosperity.\nThere were enormous building projects under her supervision, and it was also under her reign\nthat large quantities of sub-Saharan African goods started to be imported from Nubia: gold,\nincense, live elephants, panther skins, and other forms of wealth. When she died, however, her\nstepson Thutmose III took the throne. Decades after he became pharaoh, for reasons that are\nunclear, he tried to erase the memory of his mother\u2019s reign, perhaps driven by simple\nresentment over how long she had held power.\nAnother pharaoh of note was Amenhotep IV (r. 1353 - 1336 BCE). Amenhotep was\ninfamous in his own lifetime for attempting an ill-considered full-scale religious revolution. He\ntried to focus all worship of the Egyptian people on an aspect of the sun god, Ra, called Aten.\n44 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nHe went so far as to claim that Aten was the only god, something that seemed absurd to the\nresolutely polytheistic Egyptians. He renamed himself Akhenaten, which means \u201cthe one useful\nto Aten,\u201d moved the capital to a new city he had built, sacked the temples of other gods, and\neven had agents chisel off references to the other gods from buildings and walls. All the while,\nhe insisted that he and his queen, Nefertiti, be worshiped as gods themselves as the direct\nrepresentatives of Aten. Historians do not know why he tried to bring about this religious\nrevolution, but one reasonable theory is that he was trying to reduce the power of the priests,\nwho had steadily become richer and more powerful over the centuries at the expense of the\npharaohs themselves.\nAkhenaten\u2019s attempted revolution was a disaster. In the eyes of common people and of\nlater pharaohs, he had fundamentally undermined the very stability of Egypt. In the eyes of his\nsubjects, the royal person was no longer seen as a reliable spiritual anchor \u2013 the pharaoh was\nsupposed to be the great protector of the religious and social order, but instead one had tried to\ncompletely destroy it. This was the beginning of the end of the central position the pharaoh had\nenjoyed in the life of all Egyptians up until that point.\nAkhenaten\u2019s son restored all of the old religious traditions. This was the young king\nTutankhamun (\"King Tut\") (r. 1336 \u2013 1326), who is important for restoring the religion and,\narguably, for the simple fact that his tomb was never looted by grave robbers before it was\ndiscovered by a British archaeologist in 1922 CE. It provided the single most significant trove of\nartifacts from the New Kingdom yet found when it was discovered, sparking an interest in\nancient Egyptian history all over the world.\n45 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe sarcophagus of King Tutankhamun.\nA new dynasty of pharaohs ruled the New Kingdom in the aftermath of Akhenaten\u2019s\ndisastrous experiment, the most powerful of which was Ramses II (r. 1279 - 1213). Ramses\ncampaigned against the growing power of an empire in the north called the Hittites, one of the\nmajor empires of the Bronze Age period (considered in more detail in the next chapter). He\nruled for an astonishingly long time and reputedly sired some 160 children with wives and\nconcubines. He also supervised the construction of the Great Temple of Abu Simbel noted\nabove. Ramses was, however, the last of the great pharaohs, with all of those who followed\nworking to stave off disaster more so than expand Egyptian power.\nThe New Kingdom collapsed in about 1150 BCE. This collapse was part of a much\nlarger pattern across the ancient Middle East and North Africa: the collapse of the Bronze Age\n46 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nitself. In the case of Egypt, this took the form of the first of a series of foreign invasions, that of\nthe \u201cSea People,\u201d whose origins have never been determined despite concentrated scholarship\non the question. Later, invaders referred to as \u201cgangs of bandits\u201d from what is today Libya, to\nthe west of Egypt, further undermined the kingdom, and it finally fell into a long period of political\nfragmentation. A long period of civil war and conflict engulfed Egypt, and from that point on\nEgypt proved vulnerable to foreign conquest. In the course of the centuries that followed,\nAssyria, Persia, the Greeks, and the Romans would, one after the other, add Egypt to their\nrespective empires.\nContinuities in Egyptian History\nThe long-term pattern in Egyptian history is that there were long periods of stability and\nprosperity disrupted by periodic invasions and disasters. Throughout the entire period,\nhowever, there were many cultural, spiritual, and intellectual traditions that stayed the same. In\nterms of the spiritual beliefs of the ancient Egyptians, those traditions most often focused on the\nidentity and the role of the king in relation to the gods. In prosaic politics and social\norganization, they revolved around the role of the scribes. In terms of foreign relations, they\nevolved over time as Egypt developed stronger ongoing contacts with neighboring states and\ncultures.\nThe most important figure in Egyptian spiritual life was the king; he (or sometimes she)\nwas believed to form a direct connection between the gods and the Egyptian people. Each king\nhad five names \u2013 his birth name, three having to do with his divine status, and one having to do\nwith rulership of the two unified kingdoms. One of the divine names referred to the divine\nkingship itself, temporarily linked to the current holder of that title: whoever happened to be king\nat the time.\nThe Egyptians had a colorful and memorable set of religious beliefs, one that dominated\nthe lives of the kings, who claimed to be not just reflections of or servants of the gods, but gods\nthemselves on earth. The central theme among the great epic stories of Egyptian religion was\nthat there was a certain order and harmony in the universe that the gods had created, but that it\nwas threatened by forces of destruction and chaos. It was the job of humans, especially\nEgyptians, to maintain harmony through proper rituals and through making sure that Egyptian\nsociety was stable. For Egyptians the world was divided between themselves and everyone\nelse. This was not just a function of arrogance, however, but instead reflected a belief that the\ngods had designated the Egyptians to be the sacred keepers of order.\n47 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nOne peculiar aspect of the obsessive focus on the person of the king was the fact that\nthe kings often married their sisters and daughters; the idea was that if one was a god, one did\nnot want to pollute the sacred bloodline by having children with mere humans. An unfortunate\nside effect was, not surprisingly, that there were a lot of fairly deranged and unhealthy Egyptian\nroyalty over the years, since the royal lines were, by definition, inbred. Fortunately for the\nEgyptian state, however, the backbone of day-to-day politics was the enormous bureaucracy\nstaffed by the scribal class, a class that survived the entire period covered in this chapter.\nMore writing survives from ancient Egypt than any other ancient civilization of the\nMediterranean region. There are two major reasons for that survival. First, Egypt\u2019s dry climate\nensured that records kept on papyrus had a decent chance of surviving since they were unlikely\nto rot away. Thousands of papyri documents have been discovered that were simply dumped\ninto holes in the desert and left there; the sand and the climate conspired to preserve them.\nSecond, Egypt developed an important social class of scribes whose whole vocation was\nmastering the complex Egyptian writing systems and keeping extensive records of almost every\naspect of life, from religious ritual to mundane record-keeping.\nAn example of hieroglyphics - the above depicts the sacred style used in temple and tomb\ncarvings, as opposed to the \u201ccursive\u201d form used for everyday record keeping.\nThe writing of ancient Egypt was in hieroglyphics, which are symbols that were adapted\nover time from pictures. There were several different forms of hieroglyphics, including two\ndistinct alphabets during the period covered in this chapter, all of which were very difficult to\n48 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nmaster. It took years of training to become literate in hieroglyphics, training that was only\nafforded to the scribes. Scribes recorded everything from tax records, to mercantile\ntransactions, to the sacred prayers for the dead on the walls of the tombs of kings and nobles.\nThey served as an essential piece of the continuity of Egyptian politics and culture for\nthousands of years. In other words, because they used the same language and the same\nalphabets of symbols, and because they recorded the rituals and transactions of Egyptian\nsociety, scribes were a kind of cultural glue that kept things going from generation to generation.\nIn all three of the great dynasties and during the Intermediate Periods, it was the scribes who\nprovided continuity.\nAs iconic as hieroglyphic writing, which remains famous because of the sheer amount of\nit that survived carved in stone in tombs and palaces, was the creation of monumental\narchitecture by the Egyptian state, first exemplified by the pyramids. Sometime around 2660\nBCE the first pyramid was built for the king Djoser. Djoser was renowned in the Egyptian\nsources for his wisdom, and centuries after his death he became a legendary figure to later\nEgyptians. The architect who designed the pyramid, Imhotep, was later deified as a son of\nPtah, the god who created the universe. Unlike Mesopotamian ziggurats, which were always\ntemples, the pyramids were always tombs. The purpose of the pyramids was to house the king\nwith all of the luxuries and equipment he would need in his journey to the afterlife, as well as to\ncelebrate the king's legacy and memory.\nThe pyramids were constructed over a period of about 250 years, from 2660 to 2400\nBCE. For a long time, historians thought that they were built by slaves, but it now seems very\nlikely that they were built by laborers employed by the king and paid by royal agents. Each\nbuilding block weighed about 2.5 tons and had to be hauled up ramps with ropes. As noted\nabove, only Egypt\u2019s unique access to the bounty of the Nile provided enough energy for this to\nbe viable. Egypt was the envy of the ancient world because of its incredible wealth, wealth that\nwas the direct result of its huge surplus of grain, all fed by the Nile's floods. The pyramids were\nbuilt year-round, but work was most intense in September, when the floods of the Nile were at\ntheir height and farmers were not able to work the fields. In short, nowhere else on earth could\nthe pyramids have been built. There had to be a gigantic surplus of energy in the form of\ncalories available to get it done.\nPyramid building itself was the impetus behind the massive expansion of bureaucracy in\nthe Old Kingdom, since the state became synonymous with the diversion and redistribution of\nresources needed to keep an enormous labor force mobilized. The king could, in theory,\nrequisition anything, mobilize anyone, and generally exercise total control, although practical\n49 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nlimits were respected by the administration. Since there was no currency, \u201cpayment\u201d to scribes\nusually took the form of fiefs (i.e. grants of land) that returned to the royal holdings after the\nofficial's death, a practice that atrophied after the fall of the Old Kingdom.\nLike their neighbors in Mesopotamia, the Egyptians lived in a redistributive economy, an\neconomy in which crops were taken directly from farmers (i.e. peasants) by the agents of the\nking and then redistributed. Appropriately enough, many of the surviving documents from\nancient Egypt are tax records, carefully recorded in hieroglyphics by scribes. Peasants in Egypt\nwere tied to the land they lived on and were thus serfs rather than free peasants. A serf is a\nfarmer who is legally tied to the land he or she works on \u2013 they cannot leave the land to look for\na better job elsewhere, living in a state very near to slavery. The peasants lived in \u201cclosed\u201d\nvillages in which people were not allowed to move in, nor were existing families supposed to\nmove out.\nInterestingly, unlike many other ancient societies, women in Egypt were nearly the legal\nequals of men. They had the legal right to own property, sue, and essentially exist as\nindependent legal entities. This is all the more striking in that many of the legal rights that\nEgyptian women possessed were not available to women in Europe (or the United States) until\nthe late 1800s CE, over three thousand years later. Likewise, Egyptian women enjoyed much\nmore legal autonomy than did women in many other ancient societies, particularly that of the\nGreeks.\nEven though the essential characteristic of Egyptian religion and social structure was\ncontinuity, its relationships with neighboring cultures did change over time. One important\nneighbor of Egypt was the kingdom of Nubia to the south, in present-day Sudan. Nubia was\nrich in gold, ivory, and slaves, seized from neighboring lands, making it a wealthy and powerful\nplace in its own right. Egypt traded with Nubia, but also suffered from raids by warlike Nubian\nkingdoms. One of the key political posts in Egypt was the Keeper of the Gateway of the South,\na military governor who tried to protect trade from these attacks. At the start of the Middle\nKingdom, Mentuhotep II managed to not only reunite Egypt, but to conquer the northern portion\nof Nubia as well. Kings continued this pattern, holding on to Nubian territory and building a\nseries of forts and garrisons to ensure the speedy extraction of Nubian wealth. (Much later, a\nNubian king, Piankhy, returned the favor by conquering Egypt - he claimed to be restoring a\npurer form of Egyptian rule than had survived in Egypt itself!)\nTrade contact was not limited to Nubia, of course. Despite the fact that the Egyptians\nthought of themselves as being superior to other cultures and civilizations, they actively traded\nwith not only Nubia but the various civilizations and peoples of the Near and Middle East.\n50 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nStarting in earnest with the Middle Kingdom, trade caravans linked Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and\nEgypt (and, later, Greece as well). There was a rich diplomatic exchange between the Egyptian\nkings and the kings of their neighboring lands \u2013 overall, they spent far more time trading with\ntheir neighbors and sending one another gifts than waging war. Likewise, as noted above in the\nsection on the New Kingdom, military expansionism did not preclude Egypt\u2019s membership in a\n\u201cbrotherhood\u201d of other states during the Bronze Age.\nThat being said, by the time of the Middle Kingdom, there was an organized and fortified\nmilitary presence on all of Egypt\u2019s borders, with particular attention to Nubia and \u201cAsia\u201d (i.e.\neverything east of the Sinai Peninsula). One king described himself as the \u201cthroat-slitter of\nAsia,\u201d and all the way through the New Kingdom, Egyptians tended to regard themselves as\nbeing the most important and \u201ccentral\u201d civilization in the world.\nConclusion\nThis chapter concludes its detailed consideration of Egypt with the fall of the New\nKingdom not because Egyptian civilization vanished, but because it did not enjoy lasting stability\nunder a native Egyptian dynasty again for most of the rest of ancient history. Instead, after the\nNew Kingdom, Egypt was often torn between rival claimants to the title of pharaoh, and\nbeginning with a civilization discussed in the next chapter, the Assyrians, Egypt itself was often\nconquered by powerful rivals. It is important to bear in mind, however, that Egypt remained the\nrichest place in the ancient world because of the incredible abundance of the Nile, and whether\nit was the Assyrians, the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, or the Arabs doing the conquering,\nEgypt was always one of the greatest prizes that could be won in conquest. Likewise, Egypt\ncontributed not just wealth but its unique culture to the surrounding regions, serving as one of\nthe founding elements of Western Civilization as a whole.\nImage Citations (Wikimedia Commons):\nEgypt map - Jeff Dahl\nGreat Pyramid - Kallerna\nTutankhamun's coffin - D.

That period saw the emergence and evolution of increasingly sophisticated\nancient states, some of which evolved into real empires. It was a period in which long-distance\ntrade networks and diplomatic exchanges between states became permanent aspects of\npolitical, economic, and cultural life in the eastern Mediterranean region. It was, in short, the\nperiod during which civilization itself spread and prospered across the area.\nThe period is named after one of its key technological bases: the crafting of bronze.\nBronze is an alloy of tin and copper. An alloy is a combination of metals created when the\nmetals bond at the molecular level to create a new material entirely. Needless to say, historical\npeoples had no idea why, when they took tin and copper, heated them up, and beat them\ntogether on an anvil they created something much harder and more durable than either of their\nstarting metals. Some innovative smith did figure it out, and in the process ushered in an array\nof new possibilities.\nBronze was important because it revolutionized warfare and, to a lesser extent,\nagriculture. The harder the metal, the deadlier the weapons created from it and the more\neffective the tools. Agriculturally, bronze plows allowed greater crop yields. Militarily, bronze\nweapons completely shifted the balance of power in warfare; an army equipped with bronze\nspear and arrowheads and bronze armor was much more effective than one wielding wooden,\ncopper, or obsidian implements.\nAn example of bronze\u2019s impact is, as noted in the previous chapter, the expansionism of\nthe New Kingdom. The New Kingdom of Egypt conquered more territory than any earlier\nEgyptian empire. It was able to do this in part because of its mastery of bronze-making and the\neffectiveness of its armies as a result. The New Kingdom also demonstrates another\nnoteworthy aspect of bronze: it was expensive to make and expensive to distribute to soldiers,\nmeaning that only the larger and richer empires could afford it on a large scale. Bronze tended\nto stack the odds in conflicts against smaller city-states and kingdoms, because it was harder for\nthem to afford to field whole armies outfitted with bronze weapons. Ultimately, the power of\nbronze contributed to the creation of a whole series of powerful empires in North Africa and the\nMiddle East, all of which were linked together by diplomacy, trade, and (at times) war.\n52 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Bronze Age States\nThere were four major regions along the shores of, or near to, the eastern Mediterranean\nthat hosted the major states of the Bronze Age: Greece, Anatolia, Canaan and Mesopotamia,\nand Egypt. Those regions were close enough to one another (e.g. it is roughly 800 miles from\nGreece to Mesopotamia, the furthest distance between any of the regions) that ongoing\nlong-distance trade was possible. While wars were relatively frequent, most interactions\nbetween the states and cultures of the time were peaceful, revolving around trade and\ndiplomacy. Each state, large and small, oversaw diplomatic exchanges written in Akkadian (the\ninternational language of the time) maintaining relations, offering gifts, and demanding\nconcessions as circumstances dictated. Although the details are often difficult to establish, we\ncan assume that at least some immigration occurred as well.\nOne state whose very existence coincided with the Bronze Age, vanishing afterwards,\nwas that of the Hittites. Beginning in approximately 1700 BCE, the Hittites established a large\nempire in Anatolia, the landmass that comprises present-day Turkey. The Hittite Empire\nexpanded rapidly based on a flourishing bronze-age economy, expanding from Anatolia to\nconquer territory in Mesopotamia, Syria, and Canaan, ultimately clashing with the New Kingdom\nof Egypt. The Hittites fought themselves to a stalemate against the Egyptians, after which they\nreached a diplomatic accord to hold on to Syria while the Egyptians held Canaan.\nUnlike the Egyptians, the Hittites had the practice of adopting the customs, technologies,\nand religions of the people they conquered and the people they came in contact with. They did\nnot seek to impose their own customs on others, instead gathering the literature, stories, and\nbeliefs of their subjects. Their pantheon of gods grew every time they conquered a new\ncity-state or tribe, and they translated various tales and legends into their own language. There\nis some evidence that it was the Hittites who formed the crucial link between the civilizations of\nMesopotamia and the civilizations of the Mediterranean, most importantly of the Greeks. The\nHittites transmitted Mesopotamian technologies (including math, astronomy, and engineering)\nas well as Mesopotamian legends like the Epic of Gilgamesh, the latter of which may have gone\nthrough a long process of translation and re-interpretation to become the Greek story of\nHercules. Simply put, the Hittites were the quintessential Bronze Age civilization: militarily\npowerful, economically prosperous, and connected through diplomacy and war with the other\ncultures and states of the time.\n53 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Hittite state is depicted in pink and New Kingdom Egyptian territory in green on the map\nabove. The island \u201cAlasiya\u201d is present-day Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean.\nTo the east of the Hittite Empire, Mesopotamia was not ruled by a single state or empire\nduring most of the Bronze Age. The Babylonian empire founded by Hammurabi was invaded by\nthe Hittites, who sacked Babylon but did not stay to rule over it. Instead, Babylon was ruled by\nthe Kassites (whose origins are unknown) beginning in 1595 BCE. Over the following centuries,\nthe Kassites successfully ruled over Babylon and the surrounding territories, with the entire\nregion enjoying a period of prosperity. To the north, beyond Mesopotamia (the land between the\nrivers) itself, a rival state known as Assyria both traded with and warred against\nKassite-controlled Babylon. Eventually (starting in 1225 BCE), Assyria led a short-lived period\nof conquest that conquered Babylon and the Kassites, going on to rule over a united\nMesopotamia before being forced to retreat against the backdrop of a wider collapse of the\npolitical and commercial network of the Bronze Age (described below).\nBoth the Kassites and the Assyrians were proud members of the diplomatic network of\nrulers that included New Kingdom Egypt and the Hittites (as well as smaller and less significant\nkingdoms in Canaan and Anatolia). Likewise, both states encouraged trade, and goods were\nexchanged across the entire region of the Middle East. Compared to some later periods, it was\na time of relative stability and, while sometimes interrupted by short-term wars, mostly peaceful\nrelations between the different states.\n54 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nTo the west, it was during the Bronze Age that the first distinctly Greek civilizations\narose: the Minoans of the island of Crete and the Mycenaeans of Greece itself. Their\ncivilizations, which likely merged together due to invasion after a long period of coexistence,\nwere the basis of later Greek civilization and thus a profound influence on many of the\nneighboring civilizations of the Middle East in the centuries to come, just as the civilizations of\nthe Middle East unquestionably influenced them. At the time, however, the Minoans and\nMycenaeans were primarily traders and, in the case of the Mycenaeans, raiders, rather than\nrepresenting states on par with those of the Hittites, Assyrians, or Egyptians.\nBoth the Minoans and Mycenaeans were seafarers. Whereas almost all of the other\ncivilizations of the eastern Mediterranean were land empires, albeit ones who traded and\ntraveled via waterways, the Greek civilizations were very closely tied to the sea itself. The\nMinoans ruled the island of Crete in the Mediterranean and created a merchant marine (i.e. a\nfleet whose purpose is primarily trade, not war) to trade with the Egyptians, Hittites, and other\npeoples of the area. One of the noteworthy archaeological traits of the Minoans is that there is\nvery little evidence of fortifications of their palaces or cities, unlike those of other ancient\npeoples, indicating that they were much less concerned about foreign invasion than were the\nneighboring land empires thanks to the Minoans\u2019 island setting.\nThe Minoans built enormous palace complexes that combined government, spiritual, and\ncommercial centers in huge, sprawling buildings that were interconnected and which housed\nthousands of people. The Greek legend of the labyrinth, the great maze in which a bull-headed\nmonster called the minotaur roamed, was probably based on the size and the confusion of\nthese Minoan complexes. Frescoes painted on the walls of the palaces depicted elaborate\nathletic events featuring naked men leaping over charging bulls. Minoan frescoes have even\nbeen found in the ruins of an Egyptian (New Kingdom) palace, indicating that Minoan art was\nvalued outside of Crete itself.\nThe Minoans traded actively with their neighbors and developed their own systems of\nbureaucracy and writing. They used a form of writing referred to by historians as Linear A that\nhas never been deciphered. Their civilization was very rich and powerful by about 1700 BCE\nand it continued to prosper for centuries. Starting in the early 1400s BCE, however, a wave of\ninvasions carried out by the Mycenaeans to the north eventually extinguished Minoan\nindependence. By that time, the Minoans had already shared artistic techniques, trade, and\ntheir writing system with the Mycenaeans, the latter of which served as the basis of Mycenaean\nrecord keeping in a form referred to as Linear B. Thus, while the Minoans lost their political\n55 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nindependence, Bronze-Age Greek culture as a whole became a blend of Minoan and\nMycenaean influences.\nThe Minoans were, according to the surviving archaeological evidence, relatively\npeaceful. They traded with their neighbors, and while there is evidence of violence (including\nhuman sacrifice) within Minoan society, there is no indication of large-scale warfare, just passing\nreferences from the Mycenaeans about Minoan mastery of the seas. In contrast, the\nMycenaeans were extremely warlike. They traded with their neighbors but they also plundered\nthem when the opportunity arose. Centuries later, the culture of the Mycenaeans would be\ncelebrated in the epic poems (nominally written by the poet Homer, although it is likely \u201cHomer\u201d\nis a mythical figure himself) The Iliad and The Odyssey, describing the exploits of great\nMycenaean heroes like Agamemnon, Achilles, and Odysseus. Those exploits almost always\nrevolved around warfare, as immortalized in Homer\u2019s account of the Mycenaean siege of Troy, a\ncity in western Anatolia whose ruins were discovered in the late nineteenth century CE.\nFrom their ships, the Mycenaeans operated as both trading partners and raiders as\ncircumstances would dictate; it is clear from the archeological evidence that they traded with\nEgypt and the Near East (i.e. Lebanon and Palestine), but equally clear that they raided and\nwarred against both vulnerable foreign territories and against one another. There is even\nevidence that the Hittites enacted the world\u2019s first embargo of shipping and goods against the\nMycenaeans in retaliation for Mycenaean meddling in Hittite affairs.\nThe Mycenaeans relied on the sea so heavily because Greece was a very difficult place\nto live. Unlike Egypt or Mesopotamia, there were no great rivers feeding fertile soil, just\nmountains, hills, and scrubland with poor, rocky soil. There were few mineral deposits or other\nnatural resources that could be used or traded with other lands. As it happens, there are iron\ndeposits in Greece but its use was not yet known by the Mycenaeans. They thus learned to\ncultivate olives to make olive oil and grapes to make wine, two products in great demand all\nover the ancient world that were profitable enough to sustain seagoing trade. It is also likely\nthat the difficult conditions in Greece helped lead the Mycenaeans to be so warlike, as they\nraided each other and their neighbors in search of greater wealth and opportunity.\n56 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe \u201cMask of Agamemnon,\u201d a Mycenaean funerary mask discovered by a German\narchaeologist in the late nineteenth century.\nThe Mycenaeans were a society that glorified noble warfare. As war is depicted in the\nIliad, battles consisted of the elite noble warriors of each side squaring off against each other\nand fighting one-on-one, with the rank-and-file of poorer soldiers providing support but usually\nnot engaging in actual combat. In turn, Mycenaean ruins (and tombs) make it abundantly clear\nthat most Mycenaeans were dirt-poor farmers working with primitive tools, lorded over by\nbronze-wielding lords who demanded labor and wealth. Foreign trade was in service to\nproviding luxury goods to this elite social class, a class that was never politically united but\ninstead shared a common culture of warrior-kings and their armed retinues. Some beautiful\nartifacts and amazing myths and poems have survived from this civilization, but it was also one\nof the most predatory civilizations we know about from ancient history.\n57 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Collapse of the Bronze Age\nThe Bronze Age at its height witnessed several large empires and peoples in regular\ncontact with one another through both trade and war. The pharaohs of the New Kingdom\ncorresponded with the kings and queens of the Hittite Empire and the rulers of the Kassites and\nAssyrians; it was normal for rulers to refer to one another as \u201cbrother\u201d or \u201csister.\u201d Each empire\nwarred with its rivals at times, but it also worked with them to protect trade routes. Certain\nMesopotamian languages, especially Akkadian, became international languages of diplomacy,\nallowing travelers and merchants to communicate wherever they went. Even the warlike and\nrelatively unsophisticated Mycenaeans played a role on the periphery of this ongoing network of\nexchange.\nThat said, most of the states involved in this network fell into ruin between 1200 - 1100\nBCE. The great empires collapsed, followed by a period of about 100 years of recovery, with\nnew empires arising in the aftermath. There is still no definitive explanation for why this\ncollapse occurred, not least because the states that had been keeping records stopped doing so\nas their bureaucracies disintegrated. The surviving evidence seems to indicate that some\ncombination of events - some caused by humans and some environmental - probably combined\nto spell the end to the Bronze Age.\nAround 1050 BCE, two of the victims of the collapse, the New Kingdom of Egypt and the\nHittite Empire, left clear indications in their records that drought had undermined their grain\nstores and their social stability. In recent years archaeologists have presented strong scientific\nevidence that the climate of the entire region became warmer and more arid, supporting the\nidea of a series of debilitating droughts. Even the greatest of the Bronze Age empires existed in\na state of relative precarity, relying on regular harvests in order to not just feed their population,\nbut sustain the governments, armies, and building projects of their states as a whole. Thus,\nenvironmental disaster could have played a key role in undermining the political stability of\nwhole regions at the time.\nEven earlier, starting in 1207 BCE, there are indications that a series of invasions swept\nthrough the entire eastern Mediterranean region. The New Kingdom of Egypt survived the\ninvasion of the \u201csea people,\u201d some of whom historians are now certain went on to settle in\nCanaan (they are remembered in the Hebrew Bible as the Philistines against whom the early\nHebrews struggled), but the state was badly weakened in the process. In the following\ndecades, other groups that remain impossible to identify precisely appear to have sacked the\nMycenaean palace complexes and various cities across the Near East. While Assyria in\n58 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nnorthern Mesopotamia survived the collapse, it lost its territories in the south to Elam, a warlike\nkingdom based in present-day southern Iran.\nThe identity of the foreign invaders is not clear from the scant surviving record. One\ndistinct possibility is that the \u201cbandits\u201d (synonymous in many cases with \u201cbarbarians\u201d in ancient\naccounts) blamed for destabilizing the region might have been a combination of foreign invaders\nand peasants displaced by drought and social chaos who joined the invasions out of\ndesperation. It is thus easy to imagine a confluence of environmental disaster, foreign invasion,\nand peasant rebellion ultimately destroying the Bronze Age states. What is clear is that the\ninvasions took place over the course of decades - from roughly 1180 to 1130 BCE - and that\nthey must have played a major role in the collapse of the Bronze Age political and economic\nsystem.\nWhile the precise details are impossible to pin down, the above map depicts likely invasion\nroutes during the Bronze Age Collapse. More important than those details is the result: the fall\nof almost all of the Bronze Age kingdoms and empires.\nFor roughly 100 years, from 1200 BCE to 1100 BCE, the networks of trade and\ndiplomacy considered above were either disrupted or destroyed completely. Egypt recovered\nand new dynasties of pharaohs were sometimes able to recapture some of the glory of the past\nEgyptian kingdoms in their building projects and the power of their armies, but in the long run\nEgypt proved vulnerable to foreign invasion from that point on. Mycenaean civilization\n59 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ncollapsed utterly, leading to a Greek \u201cdark age\u201d that lasted some three centuries. The Hittite\nEmpire never recovered in Anatolia, while in Mesopotamia the most noteworthy survivor of the\ncollapse - the Assyrian state - went on to become the greatest power the region had yet seen.\nThe Iron Age\nThe decline of the Bronze Age led to the beginning of the Iron Age. Bronze was\ndependent on functioning trade networks: tin was only available in large quantities from mines in\nwhat is today Afghanistan, so the collapse of long-distance trade made bronze impossible to\nmanufacture. Iron, however, is a useful metal by itself without the need of alloys (although early\nforms of steel - iron alloyed with carbon, which is readily available everywhere - were around\nalmost from the start of the Iron Age itself). Without copper and tin available, some innovative\nsmiths figured out that it was possible, through a complicated process of forging, to create iron\nimplements that were hard and durable. Iron was available in various places throughout the\nMiddle East and Mediterranean regions, so it did not require long-distance trade as bronze had.\nThe Iron Age thus began around 1100 BCE, right as the Bronze Age ended.\nOne cautionary note in discussing this shift: iron was very difficult to work with compared\nto bronze, and its use spread slowly. For example, while iron use became increasingly common\nstarting in about 1100 BCE, the later Egyptian kingdoms did not use large amounts of iron tools\nuntil the seventh century BCE, a full five centuries after the Iron Age itself began. Likewise, it\ntook a long time for \u201cweaponized\u201d iron to be available, since making iron weapons and armor\nthat were hard enough to endure battle conditions took a long time. Once trade networks\nrecovered, bronze weapons were still the norm in societies that used iron tools in other ways for\nmany centuries.\nOutside of Greece, which suffered its long \u201cdark age\u201d following the collapse of the\nBronze Age, a number of prosperous societies and states emerged relatively quickly at the start\nof the Iron Age. They re-established trade routes and initiated a new phase of Middle Eastern\npolitics that eventually led to the largest empires the world had yet seen.\nIron Age Cultures and States\nThe region of Canaan, which corresponds with modern Palestine, Israel, and Lebanon,\nhad long been a site of prosperity and innovation. Merchants from Canaan traded throughout\nthe Middle East, its craftsmen were renowned for their work, and it was even a group of\n60 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nCanaanites - the Hyksos - who briefly ruled Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period.\nAlong with their neighbors the Hebrews, the most significant of the ancient Canaanites were the\nPhoenicians, whose cities (politically independent but united in culture and language) were\ncentered in present-day Lebanon.\nThe Phoenicians were not a particularly warlike people. Instead, they are remembered\nfor being travelers and merchants, particularly by sea. They traveled farther than any other\nancient people; sometime around 600 BCE, according to the Greek historian Herodotus, a\nPhoenician expedition even sailed around Africa over the course of three years (if that actually\nhappened, it was an achievement that would not be accomplished again for almost 2,000\nyears). The Phoenicians established colonies all over the shores Mediterranean, where they\nprovided anchors in a new international trade network that eventually replaced the one\ndestroyed with the fall of the Bronze Age. Likewise, Phoenician cities served as the crossroads\nof trade for goods that originated as far away as England (metals were mined in England and\nshipped all the way to the Near East via overland routes). The most prominent Phoenician city\nwas Carthage in North Africa, which centuries later would become the great rival of the Roman\nRepublic.\nPhoenician trade was not, however, the most important legacy of their society. Instead,\nnone of their various accomplishments has had a more lasting influence than that of their writing\nsystem. As early as 1300 BCE, building on the work of earlier Canaanites, the Phoenicians\ndeveloped a syllabic alphabet that formed the basis of Greek and Roman writing much later. A\nsyllabic alphabet has characters that represent sounds (called phonemes), rather than\ncharacters that represent things or concepts. These alphabets are much smaller and less\ncomplex than symbolic ones. It is possible for a non-specialist to learn to read and write using a\nsyllabic alphabet much more quickly than using a symbolic one (like Egyptian hieroglyphics or\nChinese characters). Thus, in societies like that of the Phoenicians, there was no need for a\nscribal class, since even ordinary merchants could become literate. Ultimately, the Greeks and\nthen the Romans adopted Phoenician writing, and the alphabets used in most European\nlanguages in the present is a direct descendant of the Phoenician one as a result. To this day,\nthe English word \u201cphonetic,\u201d meaning the correspondence of symbols and sounds, is directly\nrelated to the word \u201cPhoenician.\u201d\nThe Phoenician mastery of sailing and the use of the syllabic alphabet were both boons\nto trade. Another was a practice - the use of currency - originating in the remnants of the Hittite\nlands. Lydia, a kingdom in western Anatolia, controlled significant sources of gold (giving rise to\nthe Greek legend of King Midas, who turned everything he touched into gold). In roughly 650\n61 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nBCE, the Lydians came up with the idea of using lumps of gold and silver that had a standard\nweight. Soon, they formalized the system by stamping marks into the lumps to create the first\ntrue (albeit crude) coins, called staters. Currency revolutionized ancient economics, greatly\nincreasing the ability of merchants to travel far afield and buy foreign goods, because they no\nlonger had to travel with huge amounts of goods with them to trade. It also made tax collection\nmore efficient, strengthening ancient kingdoms and empires.\nEmpires of the Iron Age\nWhile the Phoenicians played a major role in jumpstarting long-distance trade after the\ncollapse of the Bronze Age, they did not create a strong united state. Such a state emerged\nfarther east, however: alone of the major states of the Bronze Age, the Assyrian kingdom in\nnorthern Mesopotamia survived. Probably because of their extreme focus on militarism, the\nAssyrians were able to hold on to their core cities while the states around them collapsed.\nDuring the Iron Age, the Assyrians became the most powerful empire the world had ever seen.\nThe Assyrians were the first empire in world history to systematically conquer almost all of their\nneighbors using a powerful standing army and go on to control the conquered territory for\nhundreds of years. They represented the pinnacle of military power and bureaucratic\norganization of all of the civilizations considered thus far. (Note: historians of the ancient world\ndistinguish between the Bronze Age and Iron Age Assyrian kingdoms by referring to the latter\nas the Neo-Assyrians. The Neo-Assyrians were direct descendants of their Bronze Age\npredecessors, however, so for the sake of simplicity this chapter will refer to both as the\nAssyrians.)\nThe Assyrians were shaped by their environment. Their region in northern\nMesopotamia, Ashur, has no natural borders, and thus they needed a strong military to survive;\nthey were constantly forced to fight other civilized peoples from the west and south, and\nnomads from the north. The Assyrians held that their patron god, a god of war also called\nAshur, demanded the subservience of other peoples and their respective gods. Thus, their\nconquests were justified by their religious beliefs as well as a straightforward desire for\ndominance. Eventually, they dispatched annual military expeditions and organized conscription,\nfielding large standing armies of native Assyrian soldiers who marched out every year to\nconquer more territory.\n62 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe period of political breakdown in Mesopotamia following the collapse of the Bronze\nAge ended in about 880 BCE when the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II began a series of wars to\nconquer Mesopotamia and Canaan. Over the next century, the (Neo-)Assyrians became the\nmightiest empire yet seen in the Middle East. They combined terror tactics with various\ntechnological and organizational innovations. They would deport whole towns or even small\ncities when they defied the will of the Assyrian kings, resettling conquered peoples as\nindentured workers far from their homelands. They tortured and mutilated defeated enemies,\neven skinning them alive, when faced with any threat of resistance or rebellion. The\nformerly-independent Phoenician city-states within the Assyrian zone of control surrendered,\npaid tribute, and deferred to Assyrian officials rather than face their wrath in battle.\nThe Assyrians were the most effective military force of the ancient world up to that point.\nThey outfitted their large armies with well-made iron weapons (they appear to be the first major\nkingdom to manufacture iron weapons in large numbers). They invented a messenger service\nto maintain lines of communication and control, with messengers on horseback and waystations\nto replace tired horses, so that they could communicate across their empire. All of their\nconquered territories were obliged to provide annual tributes of wealth in precious metals and\ntrade goods which funded the state and the military.\nThe Assyrians introduced two innovations in military technology and organization that\nwere of critical importance: a permanent cavalry, the first of any state in the world, and a large\nstanding army of trained infantry. It took until the middle of the eighth century BCE for selective\nbreeding of horses to produce real \u201cwar horses\u201d large enough to carry a heavily armed and\narmored man into and through an entire battle. The Assyrians adopted horse archery from the\nnomads they fought from the north, which along with swords and short lances wielded from\nhorseback made chariots permanently obsolete. The major focus of Assyrian taxation and\nbureaucracy was to keep the army funded and trained, which allowed them to completely\ndominate their neighbors for well over a century.\nBy the time of the reign of Assyrian king Tiglath-Pilezer III (r. 745 \u2013 727 BCE), the\nAssyrians had pushed their borders to the Mediterranean in the west and to Persia (present-day\nIran) in the east. Their conquests culminated in 671 BCE when king Esarhaddon (r. 681 \u2013 668\nBCE) invaded Egypt and conquered not only the entire Egyptian kingdom, but northern Nubia\nas well. This is the first time in history that both of the founding river valleys of ancient\ncivilization, those of the Nile and of Mesopotamia, were under the control of a single political\nentity.\n63 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe expansion of the Assyrian Empire, originating from northern Mesopotamia.\nThe style of Assyrian rule ensured the hatred of conquered peoples. They demanded\nconstant tribute and taxation and funneled luxury goods back to their main cities. They did not\ntry to set up sustainable economies or assimilate conquered peoples into a shared culture,\ninstead skimming off the top of the entire range of conquered lands. Their style of rule is well\nknown because their kings built huge monuments to themselves in which they boasted about\nthe lands they conquered and the tribute they exacted along the way.\nWhile their subjects experienced Assyrian rule as militarily-enforced tyranny, Assyrian\nkings were proud of the cultural and intellectual heritage of Mesopotamia and supported\nlearning and scholarship. The one conquered city in their empire that was allowed a significant\ndegree of autonomy was Babylon, out of respect for its role as a center of Mesopotamian\nculture. Assyrian scribes collected and copied the learning and literature of the entire Middle\nEast. Sometime after 660 BCE, the king Asshurbanipal ordered the collection of all of the texts\nof all of his kingdom, including the ones from conquered lands, and he went on to create a\nmassive library to house them. Parts of this library survived and provide one of the most\n64 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nimportant sources of information that scholars have on the beliefs, languages, and literature of\nthe ancient Middle East.\nThe Assyrians finally fell in 609 BCE, overthrown by a series of rebellions. Their control\nof Egypt lasted barely two generations, brought to an end when the puppet pharaoh put in place\nby the Assyrians rebelled and drove them from Egypt. Shortly thereafter, a Babylonian king,\nNabopolassar, led a rebellion that finally succeeded in sacking Nineveh, the Assyrian capital.\nThe Babylonians were allied with clans of horse-riding warriors in Persia called the Medes, and\nbetween them the Assyrian state was destroyed completely. Nabopolassar went on to found the\n\u201cNeo-Babylonian\u201d empire, which became the most important power in Mesopotamia for the next\nfew generations.\nThe Neo-Babylonians adopted some of the terror tactics of the Assyrians; they, too,\ndeported conquered enemies as servants and slaves. Where they differed, however, was in\ntheir focus on trade. They built new roads and canals and encouraged long-distance trade\nthroughout their lands. They were often at war with Egypt, which also tried to take advantage of\nthe fall of the Assyrians to seize new land, but even when the two powers were at war Egyptian\nmerchants were still welcome throughout the Neo-Babylonian empire.\nA combination of flourishing trade and high taxes led to huge wealth for the king and\ncourt, and among other things led to the construction of noteworthy works of monumental\narchitecture to decorate their capital. The Babylonians inherited the scientific traditions of\nancient Mesopotamia, becoming the greatest astronomers and mathematicians yet seen, able\nto predict eclipses and keep highly detailed calendars. They also created the zodiac used up to\nthe present in astrology, reflecting the age-old practice of both science and \u201cmagic\u201d that were\nunited in the minds of Mesopotamians. In the end, however, they were the last of the great\nancient Mesopotamian empires that existed independently. Less than 100 years after their\nsuccessful rebellion against the Assyrians, they were conquered by what became the greatest\nempire in the ancient world to date: the Persians, described in a following chapter.\n65 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Hebrews\nAncient Hebrew History\nOf the Bronze and Iron-Age cultures, one played perhaps the most vital role in the\nhistory of Western Civilization: the Hebrews. The Hebrews, a people who first created a\nkingdom in the ancient land of Canaan, were among the most important cultures of the western\nworld, comparable to the ancient Greeks or Romans. Unlike the Greeks and Romans, the\nancient Hebrews were not known for being scientists or philosophers or conquerors. It was their\nreligion, Judaism, that proved to be of crucial importance in world history, both for its own sake\nand for being the religious root of Christianity and Islam. Together, these three religions are\nreferred to as the \u201cReligions of the Book\u201d in Islam, because they share a set of beliefs first\nwritten down in the Hebrew holy texts and they all venerate the same God. (Note: it should be\nemphasized that the approach taken here is that of secular historical scholarship: what is known\nabout the historical origins of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam based on empirical research\ncarried out by historians and archaeologists).\nThe history of the ancient Hebrews is a difficult subject. The most important source we\nhave about it is the Hebrew Bible itself, which describes in detail the travails of the Hebrews,\ntheir enslavement, battles, triumphs, and accomplishments. The problem with using the Hebrew\nBible as a historical source is that it is written in a mythic mode \u2013 like the literature of every other\nIron Age civilization, many events affecting the Hebrews are explained by direct divine\nintervention rather than a more prosaic historical approach. Also, the Hebrew Bible was written\nsome 400 \u2013 600 years after the events it describes. Thus, what is known about the ancient\nHebrews consists of the stories of the Hebrew Bible supplemented by the archaeological record\nand the information about the Hebrews available from other historical sources.\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the first patriarch (male clan leader) of the Hebrews was\nAbraham, a man who led the Hebrews away from Mesopotamia in about 1900 BCE. The\nHebrews left the Mesopotamian city of Ur and became wandering herders; in fact, the word\nHebrew originally meant \u201cwanderer\u201d or \u201cnomad.\u201d Abraham had a son, Isaac, and Isaac had a\nson, Jacob, collectively known as the Patriarchs in the Hebrew Bible. The Mesopotamian\norigins of the Hebrews are unclear from sources outside of the Hebrew Bible itself;\n66 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\narchaeological evidence indicates that the Hebrews may have actually been from the Levant,\nwith trade contact with the Mesopotamians, rather than coming from Mesopotamia.\nAccording to Jewish belief, by far the most important thing Abraham did was agree to the\nCovenant, the promise made between the God Yahweh (the \u201cname\u201d of God is derived from the\nHebrew characters for the phrase \u201cI am who I am,\u201d the enigmatic response of God when asked\nfor His name by the prophet Moses) and the Hebrews. The Covenant stated that in return for\ntheir devotion and worship, and the circumcision of all Hebrew males, the Hebrews would\nreceive from Yahweh a \u201cland of milk and honey,\u201d a place of peace and prosperity of their own for\nall time.\nThen, in about 1600 BCE, the Hebrews went to Egypt to escape famine and were\nwelcomed by the Hyksos dynasty (during the Second Intermediate Period of ancient Egypt).\nThe Hyksos were fellow Canaanites, after all, and they appear to have encouraged the Hebrews\nto stay. According to the Hebrew Bible, with the rise of the New Kingdom the Hebrews were\nenslaved, with their leader Moses leading them away sometime around 1300 \u2013 1200 BCE.\nThere is little archaeological or Egyptian textual evidence to support the story of the complete\nenslavement of the Hebrews, besides references in Egyptian sources to Canaanite laborers. A\npharaoh, Merneptah, makes a passing reference to a people he simply called \u201cIsrael\u201d as living in\nCanaan in 1207 BCE, which is the strongest evidence of the Hebrews\u2019 presence in Canaan in\nthe late Bronze Age.\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, Moses was not only responsible for leading the Hebrews\nfrom Egypt, but for modifying the Covenant. In addition to the exclusive worship of Yahweh and\nthe circumcision of all male Hebrews, the Covenant was amended by Yahweh to include specific\nrules of behavior: the Hebrews had to abide by the 10 Commandments in order for Yahweh to\nguarantee their prosperity in the promised land. Having agreed to the Commandments, the\nHebrews then arrived in the region that was to become their first kingdom, Israel.\nAs noted above, the tales present in the Hebrew Bible cannot generally be verified with\nempirical evidence. They also bear the imprint of earlier traditions: many stories in the Hebrew\nBible are taken from earlier Mesopotamian legends. The story of Moses is very close to the\naccount of Sargon the Great's rise from obscurity in Akkadian tradition, and the flood legend\n(described in the Bible\u2019s first book, Genesis) is taken directly from the Epic of Gilgamesh,\nalthough the motivation of the Mesopotamian gods versus that of Yahweh in those two stories is\nvery different: the Mesopotamian gods are cruel and capricious, while the flood of Yahweh is\nsent as a punishment for the sins of humankind.\n67 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nArcheological evidence has established that the Hebrews definitely started settling in\nCanaan by about 1200 BCE. The Egyptian record from 1207 BCE noted above consists of the\npharaoh boasting about his conquests in Canaan, including Israel. The story of Moses leading\nthe Hebrews out of slavery in Egypt could also have been based on the events associated with\nthe collapse of the Bronze Age, the great century or so of upheaval in which nomadic raiders\njoined forces with oppressed peasants and slaves to topple the great empires of the Bronze\nAge. Some of those people, probably Canaanites who had been subjects of the pharaohs, did\nseize freedom, and they could well have included the Hebrews.\nThe Kings and Kingdoms\nWhile the early Hebrews were communalists, meaning they shared most goods in\ncommon within their clans (referred to as the twelve \u201ctribes\u201d in the Hebrew Bible), conflicts with\nthe Philistines, another Canaanite people on the coast, led them to appoint a king, Saul, in\nabout 1020 BCE. The Philistines were one of the groups of \u201cSea People\u201d who had attacked the\nNew Kingdom of Egypt. The Philistines were a small but powerful kingdom. They were armed\nwith iron and they fought the Hebrews to a standstill initially \u2013 at one point they captured the Ark\nof the Covenant, containing the stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written.\nUnder the leadership of their kings, however, the Hebrews pushed back the Philistines and\neventually defeated them completely.\nSaul's successor was David, one of his former lieutenants, and David's was his son\nSolomon, renowned for his wisdom. The Hebrew kings founded a capital at Jerusalem, which\nhad been a Philistine town. The kings created a professional army, a caste of scribes, and a\nbureaucracy. All of this being noted, the kingdom itself was not particularly large or powerful;\nJerusalem at the time was a hill town of about 5,000 people. Israel emerged as one of the\nmany smaller kingdoms surrounded by powerful neighbors, engaging in trade and waging\nsmall-scale wars depending on the circumstances.\nSolomon was an effective ruler, forming trade relationships with nearby kingdoms and\noverseeing the growing wealth of Israel. He also lived in a manner consistent with other Iron\nAge kings, with many wives and a whole harem of concubines as well. Likewise, he taxed both\ntrade passing through the Hebrew kingdom and his own subjects. His demands for free labor\nfrom the Hebrew people amounted to one day in every three spent working on palaces and\nroyal building projects - an enormous amount from a contemporary perspective, but one that\nwas at least comparable to the redistributive economies of nearby kingdoms. Thus, while his\n68 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nsubjects came to resent aspects of his rule, neither was it markedly more exploitative than the\nnorm in the region as a whole.\nThe most important building project under Solomon was the great Temple of Jerusalem,\nthe center of the Yahwist religion. There, a class of priests carried out rituals and worship of\nYahweh. Members of the religion believed that God\u2019s attention was centered on the Temple.\nLikewise, the rituals were similar to those practiced among various Middle Eastern religions,\nfocusing on the sacrifice and burning of animals as offerings to God. David and Solomon\nsupported the priesthood, and there was thus a direct link between the growing Yahwist faith\nand the political structure of Israel.\nAs noted above, the kingdom itself was fairly rich, thanks to its good spot on trade routes\nand the existence of gold mines, but Solomon's ongoing taxation and labor demands were such\nthat resentment developed among the Hebrews over time. After his death, fully ten out of the\ntwelve tribes broke off to form their own kingdom, retaining the name Israel, while the smaller\nremnant of the kingdom took on the name Judah.\nIsrael and Judah in the ninth century BCE, approximately a century before Israel was invaded\nand destroyed by the Assyrian Empire.\n69 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe northern kingdom of Israel was larger, richer, and more cosmopolitan. Israel\u2019s capital\nwas the city of Samaria, and its people became known as Samaritans; they appear to have\ninteracted with neighboring peoples frequently and many of them remained polytheists (people\nwho worship more than one god) despite the growing movement to focus worship exclusively on\nYahweh. The southern kingdom of Judah was poorer, smaller, and more conservative; it was in\nJudah that the Prophetic Movement (see below) came into being. It is from Judah that we get\nthe word Jew: the Jews were the people of Judah.\nWith its riches, Israel was more attractive to invaders. When the Assyrian Empire\nexpanded beyond Mesopotamia, it first conquered Israel, then eventually destroyed it outright\nwhen the Israelites rose up against them (this occurred in 722 BCE). The inhabitants of Israel\neither fled to Judah or were absorbed into the Assyrian Empire, losing their cultural identity in\nthe process. This tragedy was later remembered as the origin of the \u201clost tribes\u201d of Israel \u2013\nHebrews who lost their identity and their religion because of the Assyrian enslavement. Judah\nwas overrun by the Assyrians, but Jerusalem withstood a siege long enough to convince the\nAssyrians to accept bribes to leave, and instead became a satellite kingdom dominated by the\nAssyrians but still ruled by a Hebrew king. (Judah was saved in part due to a plague that struck\nthe Assyrian army, but it still ended up a tributary of the Assyrians, paying annual tributes and\nanswering to an Assyrian official.)\nIn Judah, there were two prevailing patterns: vassalage and rebellion. Judah was simply\ntoo small to avoid paying tribute to various neighboring powers, but its people were proud and\ndefensive of their independence, so every generation or so there were uprisings. The worst\ncase was in 586 BCE, when the Jews rose up against the Neo-Babylonian Empire that\nsucceeded the Assyrians. The Babylonians burned Jerusalem, along with Solomon's Temple, to\nthe ground, and they enslaved tens of thousands of Jews. The Jews were deported to Babylon,\njust as the Israelites had been deported to Assyrian territory about 150 years earlier \u2013 this event\nis referred to as the \u201cBabylonian Captivity\u201d of the Jews.\nTwo generations later, when the Neo-Babylonian empire itself fell to the Persians, the\nPersian emperor Cyrus the Great allowed all of the enslaved people of the Babylonians to return\nto their homelands, so the Babylonian Captivity came to an end and the Jews returned to\nJudah, where they rebuilt the Temple. That being noted, what is referred to as the Jewish\n\u201cdiaspora,\u201dmeaning the geographical dispersion of the Jews, really began in 538 BCE, because\nmany Jews chose to remain in Babylon and, soon, other cities in the Persian Empire. Since they\ncontinued to practice Judaism and carry on Jewish traditions, the notion of a people scattered\nacross different lands but still united by culture and religion came into being.\n70 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nAfter being freed by Cyrus, the Jews were still part of the Persian Empire, ruled by a\nPersian governor (called a \u201csatrap\u201d). For most of the rest of their history, the Jews were able to\nmaintain their distinct cultural identity and their religion, but rarely their political independence.\nThe Jews went from being ruled by the Persians to the Greeks to the Romans (although they\ndid occasionally seize independence for a time), and were then eventually scattered across the\nRoman Empire. The real hammer-blow of the Diaspora was in the 130s CE, when the Romans\ndestroyed much of Jerusalem and forced almost all of the Jews into exile \u2013 the word diaspora\nitself means \u201cscattering,\u201d and with the destruction of the Jewish kingdom by Rome there would\nbe no Jewish state again until the foundation of the modern nation of Israel in 1948 CE.\nThe Yahwist Religion and Judaism\nThe Hebrew Bible claims that the Jews as a people worshipped Yahweh exclusively from\nthe time of the Covenant, albeit with the worship of \u201cfalse\u201d gods from neighboring lands\nsometimes undermining their unity (and inviting divine retribution on the part of Yahweh for\nthose transgressions). There is no historical or archeological evidence that suggests a single\nunified religion in Israel or Judah during the period of the united Hebrew monarchy or\npost-Solomon split between Israel and Judah, however (the Hebrew Bible itself was written\ndown centuries later). A more likely scenario is that the Hebrews, like every other culture in the\nancient world, worshipped a variety of deities, with Yahweh in a place of particular importance\nand centrality. A comparable case would be that of the Assyrians, who emphasized the worship\nof Ashur but who acknowledged the existence of other gods (including Yahweh).\nAs the Hebrews became more powerful, however, their religion changed dramatically. A\ntradition of prophets, later remembered as the Prophetic Movement, arose among certain\npeople who sought to represent the poorer and more beleaguered members of the community,\ncalling for a return to the more communal and egalitarian society of the past. The Prophetic\nMovement claimed that the Hebrews should worship Yahweh exclusively, and that Yahweh had\na special relationship with the Hebrews that set Him apart as a God and them apart as a people.\nThe Prophetic Movement lasted from the period before the Assyrian invasion of Israel through\nthe Babylonian Captivity of the Jews, from about 750 BCE - 550 BCE.\nThis new set of beliefs, regarding the special relationship of a single God to the\nHebrews, is referred to historically as the Yahwist religion. It was not yet \"Judaism,\" since it did\nnot yet disavow the belief that other gods might exist, nor did it include all of the rituals and\ntraditions associated with later Judaism. Initially, most of the Hebrews continued to at least\n71 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nacknowledge the existence of other gods \u2013 this phenomenon is called henotheism, the term for\nthe worship of only one god in the context of believing in the existence of more than one god\n(i.e. many gods exist, but we only worship one of them). Over time, this changed into true\nmonotheism: the belief that there is only one god, and that all other \u201cgods\u201d are illusory.\nThe Prophetic Movement attacked both polytheism and the Yahwist establishment\ncentered on the Temple of Jerusalem (they blamed the latter for ignoring the plight of the\ncommon people and the poor). The prophets were hostile to both the political power structure\nand to deviation from the exclusive worship of Yahweh. The prophets were also responsible for\nenunciating the idea that Yahweh was the only god, in part in reaction to the demands of Assyria\nthat all subjects acknowledge the Assyrian god Ashur as the supreme god. In other words, the\nclaim of the Prophetic Movement was not only that Yahweh was superior to Ashur, but that\nAshur was not really a god in the first place.\nThis is, so far as historians know, the first instance in world history in which the idea of a\nsingle all-powerful deity emerged among any people, anywhere (although some scholars\nconsider Akhenaten\u2019s attempted religious revolution in Egypt a quasi-monotheism). Up to this\npoint, all religions held that there were many gods or spirits and that they had some kind of\ndirect, concrete connections to specific areas. Likewise, the gods in most religions were largely\nindifferent to the actions of individuals so long as the proper prayers were recited and rituals\nperformed. Ethical conduct did not have much influence on the gods (\u201cethical conduct\u201d itself, of\ncourse, differing greatly from culture to culture), what mattered was that the gods were\nadequately appeased.\nIn contrast, early Judaism developed the belief that Yahweh was deeply invested in the\nactions of His chosen people both as a group and as individuals, regardless of their social\nstation. There are various stories in which Yahweh judged people, even the kings like David\nand Solomon, making it clear that all people were known to Yahweh and no one could escape\nHis judgment. The key difference between this belief and the idea of divine anger in other\nancient religions was that Yahweh only punished those who deserved it. He was not capricious\nand cruel like the Mesopotamian gods, for instance, nor flighty and given to bickering like the\nGreek gods.\nThe early vision of Yahweh present in the Yahwist faith was of a powerful but not\nall-powerful being whose authority and power was focused on the Hebrew people and the\nterritory of the Hebrew kingdom only. In other words, the priests of Yahweh did not claim that he\nruled over all people, everywhere, only that he was the God of the Hebrews and their land. That\nstarted to change when the Assyrians destroyed the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE.\n72 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nMany of the Hebrews regarded this disaster as proof of the corruption of the rich and powerful\nand the righteousness of the Prophetic Movement. Even though the loss of Israel was an\nobvious blow against the Hebrews as a people, the worship of Yahweh as the exclusive god of\nthe Hebrews gained considerable support in Judah. Likewise, as the exclusive worship of\nYahweh grew in importance among the Jews (now sundered from the other Hebrews, who had\nbeen enslaved), the concept of Yahweh\u2019s omnipotence and omnipresence grew as well.\nThe most important reforms of Hebrew religion occurred in the seventh century BCE. A\nJudean king, Josiah, insisted on the imposition of strict monotheism and the compilation of the\nfirst books of the Hebrew Bible, the Torah, in 621 BCE. In the process, the Yahwist priesthood\nadded the book of Deuteronomy to older sacred writings (the priests claimed to have discovered\nDeuteronomy, but almost all historians of ancient religion believe that it was simply written at the\ntime). When many Jews left the religion after Josiah's death, the prophet Jeremiah warned them\nthat disaster would ensue, and when the Neo-Babylonians conquered Judah in 586 BCE, it\nseemed to validate his warning. Likewise, during the Babylonian Captivity, the prophet Ezekiel\npredicted the liberation of the Hebrews if they stuck to their faith, and they were indeed freed\nthanks to Cyrus (who admired older cultures like the Hebrews, since the Persians were\noriginally semi-nomadic).\nThe sacred writings compiled during these events were all in the mode of the new\nmonotheism. In these writings, Yahweh had always been there as the exclusive god of the\nHebrew people and had promised them a land of abundance and peace (i.e. Israel) in return for\ntheir exclusive worship of Him. In these histories, the various defeats of the Hebrew people\nwere explained by corruption from within, often the result of Hebrews straying from the\nCovenant and worshiping other gods.\nThese reforms were complete when the Neo-Babylonians conquered Judah in 586 BCE\nand enslaved tens of thousands of the Hebrews. The impact of this event was enormous,\nbecause it led to the belief that Yahweh could not be bound to a single place. He was no longer\njust the god of a single people in a single land, worshiped at a single temple, but instead\nbecame a boundless God, omnipotent and omnipresent. The special relationship between Him\nand the Hebrews remained, as did the promise of a kingdom of peace, but the Hebrews now\nheld that He was available to them wherever they went and no matter what happened to them.\nIn Babylon itself, the thousands of Hebrews in exile not only arrived at this idea, but\ndeveloped the strict set of religious customs, of marriage laws and ceremonies, of dietary laws\n(i.e. keeping a kosher diet), and the duty of all Hebrew men to study the sacred books, all in\norder to preserve their identity. Once the Torah was compiled as a single sacred text by the\n73 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nprophet Ezra, one of the official duties of the scholarly leaders of the Jewish community, the\nrabbis, was to carefully re-copy it, character by character, ensuring that it would stay the same\nno matter where the Jews went. The result was a \u201cmobile tradition\u201d of Judaism in which the\nJews could travel anywhere and take their religion with them. This would become important in\nthe future, when they were forcibly taken from Judah by the Romans and scattered across\nEurope and North Africa. The ability of the Jews to bring their religious tradition with them would\nallow them to survive as a distinct people despite ongoing persecution in the absence of a\nstable homeland.\nAnother important aspect of Judaism was its egalitarian ethical system. The radical\nelement of Jewish religion, as well as the Jewish legal system that arose from it, the Talmud,\nwas the idea that all Jews were equal before God, rather than certain among them having a\ncloser relationship to God. This is the first time a truly egalitarian element enters into ethics; no\nother people had proposed the idea of the essential equality of all human beings (although\nsome aspects of Egyptian religion came close). Of all the legacies of Judaism, this may be the\nmost important, although it would take until the modern era for political movements to take up\nthe idea of essential equality and translate them into a concrete social, legal, and political\nsystem.\nConclusion\nWhat all of the cultures considered in this chapter have in common is that they were\nmore dynamic and, in the case of the empires, more powerful than earlier Mesopotamian (and\neven Egyptian) states. In a sense, the empires of the Bronze Age and, especially, the Iron Age\nrepresented different experiments in how to build and maintain larger economic systems and\npolitical units than had been possible earlier. The other major change is that it now becomes\npossible to discuss and examine the interactions between the various kingdoms and empires,\nnot just what happened with them internally, since the entire region from Greece to\nMesopotamia was now in sustained contact through trade, warfare, and diplomacy.\nLikewise, some of the ideas and beliefs that originated in the Bronze and Iron Ages -\nmost obviously Judaism - would go on to play a profound role in shaping the subsequent history\nof not just Western Civilization, but much of world history. Monotheism and the concept of the\nessential spiritual equality of human beings began as beliefs among a tiny minority of people in\nthe ancient world, but they would go on to become enormously influential in the long run.\n74 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nImage Citations (Wikimedia Commons):\nHittite Empire - Crates\nMask of Agamemnon - Jebulon\nBronze Age collapse - Alexikoua\nAssyrian Empire - Nigyou\nIsrael and Judah - FinnWikiNo\n75 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nChapter 4: The Archaic Age of Greece\nOverview\nTraditional Western Civilization textbooks begin with the ancient Greeks. As noted in the\nintroduction of this book, however, there are some problems with taking that approach, most\nimportantly the fact that starting with the Greeks overlooks the fact that the Greeks did not\ninvent the essential elements of civilization itself.\nThat being noted, the Greeks were unquestionably historically important and influential.\nThey can be justly credited with creating forms of political organization and approaches to\nlearning that were and remain hugely influential. Among other things, the Greeks carried out\nthe first experiments in democratic government, invented a form of philosophy and learning\nconcerned with empirical observation and rationality, created forms of drama like comedy and\ntragedy, and devised the method of researching and writing history itself. It is thus useful and\nproductive to consider the history of ancient Greece even if the conceit that other forms of\nancient history are less important is abandoned.\nThe Greek Dark Age\nDuring the Bronze Age, as described in the last chapter, the Minoans and Mycenaeans\nwere two of the civilizations that were part of the international trade and diplomacy network of\nthe Mediterranean and Middle East. The Minoans were a major seafaring civilization based on\nthe island of Crete. They created huge palace complexes, magnificent artwork, and great\nwealth. They eventually vanished as a distinct culture, most likely after they were conquered\nand absorbed by the Mycenaeans, their neighbors to the north.\nThe Mycenaeans developed as a civilization after the Minoans were already established\nin Crete. The Mycenaeans lived on the Greek mainland and the islands of the Aegean Sea and\nwere known primarily as sea-going merchants and raiders. They were extremely warlike,\nattacking each other, their neighbors, and the people they also traded with whenever the\nopportunity existed to loot and sack. The Mycenaeans were the protagonists of the famous epic\npoems written by (the possibly mythical) Homer, The Iliad and The Odyssey.\n76 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Mycenaeans vanished as a civilization at the end of the Bronze Age. The cause\nwas probably a combination of foreign invasions and local rebellions and wars. One strong\npossibility is that there was a sustained civil war among the Mycenaean palace-settlements that\nresulted in a fatal disruption to the economic setting that was essential to their very existence. A\nbad enough war in Greece itself could have easily undermined harvests, already near a\nsubsistence level, and when they were destroyed by these conflicts, towns, fortresses and\npalaces could not be rebuilt. Whatever the cause, the decline of the Mycenaeans occurred\naround 1100 BCE, marking the beginning of what historians refer to as the Dark Age in Greek\nhistory.\nOf all the regions and cultures affected by the collapse of the Bronze Age, Greece was\namong those hit hardest. First and foremost, foreign trade declined dramatically. Whereas the\nMycenaeans had been seafaring traders, their descendants were largely limited to local\nproduction and trade. Agriculture reverted to subsistence levels, and trade with neighboring\nareas all but vanished. In turn, this reversion to local subsistence economies cut them off from\nimportant sources of nutrition and materials for daily life, as well as foreign ideas and cultural\ninfluences. The Greeks went from being a great traveling and trading culture to one largely\nisolated from its neighbors. The results were devastating: some scholarly estimates are that the\npopulation of Greece declined by as much as 90% in the centuries following the Bronze Age\ncollapse.\nThe Archaic Age and Greek Values\nThe Greek Dark Age started to end around 800 BCE. The subsequent period of Greek\nhistory, from around 800 BCE - 490 BCE, is referred to as the \u201cArchaic\u201d (meaning \u201cold\u201d) Age.\nThe Archaic Age saw the re-emergence of sustained contact with foreign cultures, starting with\nthe development of Greek colonies on the Greek islands and on the western coast of Anatolia;\nthis region is called Ionia, with its Greek inhabitants speaking a dialect of Greek called Ionian.\nThese Greeks reestablished long-distance trade routes, most importantly with the Phoenicians,\nthe great traders and merchants of the Iron Age. Eventually, foreign-made goods and cultural\ncontacts started to flow back to Greece once again.\nOf the various influences the Ionian Greeks received from the Phoenicians, none was\nmore important than their alphabet. Working from the Phoenician version, the Ionian Greeks\ndeveloped their own syllabic alphabet (the earlier Greek writing system, Linear B, vanished\nduring the Greek Dark Age). This system of writing proved flexible, nuanced, and relatively easy\n77 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nto learn. Soon, the Greeks started recording not just tax records and mercantile transactions,\nbut their own literature, poetry, and drama. The earliest surviving Greek literature dates from\naround 800 - 750 BCE thanks to the use of this new alphabet (which, in turn, served as the\nbasis of the Roman alphabet and from there to the alphabets used in all Latinate European\nlanguages, including English).\nHomer's epic poems - The Iliad and The Odyssey - were written down in this period after\nbeing recited in oral form by traveling singers for centuries. They purported to recount the\ndeeds of great heroes from the Mycenaean age, in the process providing a rich tapestry of\ninformation about ancient Greek values, beliefs, and practices to later cultures. Both poems\ncelebrated arete \u2013 a Greek virtue which can be translated in English as \u201cexcellence\u201d and\n\u201csuccess,\u201d but must be understood as a moral characteristic as much as a physical or mental\none. Arete meant, among other things, fulfilling one\u2019s potential, which was almost always the\nhighest goal espoused in Greek philosophy. Throughout the epics, men and women struggle to\novercome both one another and their own limitations, while grappling with the limitations\nimposed by nature, chance, and the will of the gods.\nThe values on display in the Homeric poems spoke to the Greeks of the Archaic Age in\nhow they determined what was good and desirable in human behavior in general. The main\nfocus of the Greeks was on the two ways that a man could dominate other men: through\nstrength of arms and through skill at words. The two major areas a man had to master were thus\nwar and rhetoric: the ability to defeat enemies in battle and the ability to persuade potential\nallies in the political arena. Women did play a significant role in the Homeric tales as well,\nsometimes as murderous and sinister, like the queen Clytemnestra, but sometimes as\nexemplars of virtue, like the hero Odysseus\u2019s faithful wife Penelope. In almost all cases the\ncharacters in Homer\u2019s plays embodied the Greek ethical outlook, and they serve as one of the\nmost important sources in understanding Greek culture itself.\nWhat was important to the Greeks was the public performance of excellence, not private\nvirtue or good intentions. What mattered was how a man performed publicly, in battle, in athletic\ncompetitions, or in the public forums of debate that emerged in the growing city-states of\nArchaic Greece. The fear of shame was a built-in part of the pursuit of excellence; Greek\ncompetitions (in everything from athletics to poetry) had no second-place winners, and the\nlosers were openly mocked in the aftermath of the contests. This idea of public debate and\ncompetition was to have an enormous influence on the development of Greek culture, one that\nwould subsequently spread around the entire Mediterranean region.\n78 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nGreek values translated directly into Greece\u2019s unique political order. The Archaic Age\nwas the era when major Greek political innovations took place. Of these, the most important\nwas the creation of the polis (plural: poleis): a political unit centered on a city and including the\nsurrounding lands. The English word \u201cpolitical\u201d derives from \u201cpolis\u201d \u2013 the polis was the center of\nGreek politics in each city-state, and Greek innovations in the realm of political theory would\nhave an enormous historical legacy. From the Greek poleis of the Archaic and subsequent\nClassical Age, the notion of legal citizenship and equality, the practice of voting on laws, and a\nparticular concept of political pride now referred to as patriotism all first took shape.\nIn the Archaic Age, Greek city-states shared similar institutions. Greek citizens could\nonly be members of a single polis, and citizens had some kind of role in political\ndecision-making. Citizens would gather in the agora, an open area that was used as a market\nand a public square, and discuss matters of importance to the polis as a whole. The richest and\nmost powerful citizens became known as \u201caristocrats\u201d \u2013 the \u201cbest people.\u201d Eventually,\naristocracy became hereditary. Other free citizens could vote in many cases on either electing\nofficials or approving laws, the latter of which were usually created by a council of elders (all of\nwhom were aristocrats) \u2013 the elders were called archons. At this early stage, commoners had\nlittle real political power; their importance to the future development of democracy was the\nprecedent of meeting to discuss politics.\nEven in poleis in which citizens did not directly vote on laws, however, there was a\nstrong sense of community, out of which developed the concept of civic virtue: the idea that the\nhighest moral calling was to place the good of the community above one's own selfish desires.\nThis concept was almost unparalleled elsewhere in the ancient world. While other ancient\npeoples certainly identified with their places of origin, they linked themselves to lineages of\nkings rather than the abstract idea of a community in most cases. Also, all Greek citizens were\nequal before the law, which was a radical break since most other civilizations had different sets\nof laws based on class identity (there were considerable ironies in Greek notions of \u201cequality\u201d\nhowever - see the later chapter on classical Greece). Civic virtue, very closely related to the\nmodern concept of patriotism, was a powerful and influential idea because it would continue\nthrough the Greek Classical Age, be transmitted by Alexander the Great's conquests, and\neventually become one of, if not the single most important ethical standards of the Roman\nRepublic and Empire. It would ultimately go on to influence thinkers and politicians up to the\npresent.\nOne area of Archaic Greek culture bears additional focus: gender. Greek society was\nexplicitly patriarchal, with men holding all official positions of political power. Likewise, both the\n79 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nGreek myths and epic tales are both rife with hostility and suspicion of assertive, intelligent\nwomen, celebrating instead women who dutifully served their husbands or fathers (as noted\nabove, Penelope, the wife of the Greek hero Odysseus, is described as waiting faithfully for\ntwenty years for Odysseus to return from the invasion of Troy despite a legion of suitors trying to\nwin her and Odysseus\u2019s lands). Women were expected to be sexually monogamous with their\nhusbands while men\u2019s sexual liaisons with female slaves as well as other men of their own\nsocial rank were perfectly acceptable behaviors.\nThat being noted, it is clear that women in the Archaic Age did enjoy both social\ninfluence and some access to economic power, being able to inherit property and receiving\nsocial approval for the skillful management of households. Likewise, women were not generally\nsecluded from men in normal social discourse, with various Greek tales including moments of\ncasual interaction between men and women. Practically speaking, women were invaluable to\nthe Greek economy, providing almost all of the domestic labor and contributing to farming and\ncommerce as well. Their status, however, would grow more fraught over time: as the Archaic\nAge evolved into the Classical Age (considered in a following chapter,) restrictions on women\u2019s\nlives and freedoms would increase, especially in key poleis like Athens, culminating in some of\nthe most misogynistic gender standards in the ancient world.\nGreek Culture and Trade\nThe Greek poleis were each distinct, fiercely proud of their own identity and\nindependence, and they frequently fought small-scale wars against one another. Even as they\ndid so, they recognized each other as fellow Greeks and therefore as cultural equals. All\nGreeks spoke mutually intelligible dialects of the Greek language. All Greeks worshiped the\nsame pantheon of gods. All Greeks shared political traditions of citizenship. Finally, the Greeks\ntook part in a range of cultural practices, from listening to traveling storytellers who recited the\nIliad and Odyssey from memory to holding drawn-out drinking parties called symposia.\n80 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nDepiction of a symposium dating from c. 475 BCE.\nThe poleis also invented institutions that united the cities culturally, despite their political\nindependence, the most important of which was the Panhellenic games. \u201cPanhellenic\u201d literally\nmeans \u201call Greece,\u201d and the games were meant to unite all of the Greek poleis, including those\nfounded by colonists and located far from Greece itself. The games were a combination of\nreligious festival and competition in which aristocrats from each city competed in various sports,\nincluding javelin, discus, footraces, and a brutal form of unarmed combat called pankration.\nThe most significant of these games was the Olympics, named after Olympia, the site in\nsouthern Greece where they were held every four years. They started in 776 BCE and ended in\n393 CE \u2013 in other words, they lasted for over 1,000 years. Thanks to the Olympics, the date 776\nBCE is usually used as the definitive break between the Dark and Archaic ages of Greek\ncivilization. The Olympics were extraordinary not just in their longevity, but because Greeks from\nthe entire world of Greek settlements came to them, traveling from as far away as Sicily and the\nBlack Sea. Wars were temporarily suspended and all Greek poleis agreed to let athletes travel\nwith safe passage to take part in the games, in part because the Olympics were dedicated to\nZeus, the chief Greek god. As noted above, there were no second prizes. Greek culture was\nhugely competitive; the defeated were humiliated and the winners totally triumphant. In the\ngames, they sought, in the words of one Greek poet, \u201ceither the wreath of victory or death\u201d\n(granted, that poet was indulging in some hyperbole, as there is no evidence that defeated\nathletes actually committed suicide).\nWith the end of the Dark Age, population levels in Greece recovered. This led to\nemigration as the population outstripped the poor, rocky soil of Greece itself and forced people\nto move elsewhere. Eventually, Greek colonies stretched across the Mediterranean as far as\nSpain in the west and the coasts of the Black Sea in the north. Greeks founded colonies on the\n81 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nNorth African coast and on the islands of the Mediterranean, most importantly on Sicily. Greeks\nset up trading posts in the areas they settled, even in Egypt. The colonies continued the\nmainland practice of growing olives and grapes for oil and wine, but they also took advantage of\nmuch more fertile areas away from Greece to cultivate other crops.\nGreek colonists sometimes intermarried with local peoples on arrival, an unsurprising\npractice given that many expeditions of colonists were comprised almost entirely of young men.\nIn other cases, however, colonists found relatively isolated areas appropriate for shipping and\nset up shop, maintaining close connections with their home polis as an economic outpost. The\none factor that was common to all Greek colonies was that they were rarely far from the sea.\nThey were so closely tied to the idea of a shared Greek civilization and the need for seafaring\ntrade routes was so strong that colonists were not generally interested in trying to push inland.\nGreek colonization during the Archaic period - note how Greek colonies were always near the\nsea.\nAs trade recovered following the end of the Dark Age, the Greeks re-established their\ncommercial shipping network across the Mediterranean, with their colonies soon playing a vital\nrole. Greek merchants eagerly traded with everyone from the Celts of Western Europe to the\nEgyptians, Lydians, and Babylonians. When Julius Caesar was busy conquering Gaul about\n700 years later, he found the Celts there writing in the Greek alphabet, long since learned from\n82 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthe Greek colonies along the coast. Likewise, archaeologists have discovered beautiful\nexamples of Greek metalwork as far from Greece as northern France.\nGreek colonies far from Greece were as important as the older poleis in Greece itself,\nsince they created a common Greek civilization across the entire Mediterranean world. Greek\ncivilization was not an empire united by a single ruler or government. Instead, it was united by\nculture rather than a common leadership structure. That culture would go on to influence all of\nthe cultures to follow in a vast swath of territory throughout the Mediterranean region and the\nMiddle East.\nMilitary Organization and Politics\nA key military development unique to Greece was the phalanx: a unit of spearmen\nstanding in a dense formation, with each using his shield to protect the man to his left. Each\nsoldier in a phalanx was called a hoplite. Each hoplite had to be a free Greek citizen of his polis\nand had to be able to pay for his own weapons and armor. He also had to be able to train and\ndrill regularly with his fellow hoplites, since maneuvering in the densely-packed phalanx required\na great deal of practice and coordination. The hoplites were significant politically because they\nwere not always aristocrats, despite the fact that they had to be free citizens capable of paying\nfor their own arms. Because they defended the poleis and proved extremely effective on the\nbattlefield, the hoplites would go on to demand better political representation, something that\nwould have a major impact on Greek politics as a whole.\nDepiction of a battle between phalanxes of hoplites from rival poleis, dating from c. 560 BCE.\nThe clay vessel is an amphora, a container used for wine or olive oil.\n83 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe most noteworthy military innovation represented by the hoplites was that their form\nof organization provided one solution to the age-old problem of how to pay for highly-trained and\nmotivated soldiers: rather than a state paying for a standing army, the hoplites paid for\nthemselves and were motivated by civic virtue. When rival poleis fought, the phalanxes of each\nside would square off and stab away at each other until one side broke, threw down their\nshields, and ran away (by far the deadliest part of the confrontation). The victors would then\nallow the losers time to gather their dead for a proper burial and peace terms would be\nnegotiated.\nBy the seventh century BCE, the hoplites in many poleis were clamoring for better\npolitical representation, since they were excluded by the traditional aristocrats from meaningful\npolitical power. In many cases, the result was the rise of tyrannies: a government led by a man,\nthe tyrant, who had no legal right to power, but had been appointed by the citizens of a polis in\norder to stave off civil conflict (tyrants were generally aristocrats, but they answered to the\nneeds of the hoplites as well). To the Greeks, the term tyrant did not originally mean an unjust or\ncruel ruler, since many tyrants succeeded in solving major political crises on behalf of the\nhoplites while still managing to placate the aristocrats.\nThe tyrants, lacking official political status, had to play to the interests of the people to\nstay in power as popular dictators. They sometimes seized lands of aristocrats outright and\ndistributed them to free citizens. Many of them built public works and provided jobs, while others\nwent out of their way to promote trade. The period between 650 \u2013 500 BCE is sometimes called\nthe \u201cAge of Tyrants\u201d in Greek history because many poleis instituted tyrants to stave off civil war\nbetween aristocrats and less wealthy citizens during this period. After 500 BCE, a compromise\ngovernment called oligarchy tended to replace both aristocracies and tyrannies. In an oligarchy,\nanyone with enough money could hold office, the laws were written down and known to all free\ncitizens, and even poorer citizens could vote (albeit only yes or no) on the laws passed by\ncouncils.\nSparta and Athens\nTwo of the most memorable poleis of the Archaic Age were Sparta and Athens. The two\npoleis were in many ways a study in contrasts: an obsessively militaristic and inward-looking\nsociety of \u201cequals\u201d who controlled the largest slave society in Greece, and a cosmopolitan naval\npower at the forefront of political innovation.\n84 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nSparta\nOne scholarly work on Greek history, Frank Frost\u2019s Greek Society, describes the\nSpartans as \u201can experiment in elitist communism.\u201d From approximately 600 BCE \u2013 450 BCE,\nthe Spartans were unique in the ancient world in placing total emphasis on a super-elite and\nvery small citizenship of warriors. Starting in about 700 BCE, the Spartans conquered a large\nswath of territory in their home region of Greece, the southern Greek peninsula called the\nPeloponnesus. Sparta at the time was an aristocratic monarchy, with two kings ruling over\ncouncils of citizens. Under the two kings were a smaller council that issued laws and a large\ncouncil made up of all Spartan males over 30 who approved or rejected the laws proposed by\nthe council. Over time, citizenship was limited to men who had undergone the arduous military\ntraining for which the Spartans are best remembered.\nSpartan culture was among the most extreme forms of militarism the world has ever\nseen. Spartan boys were taken from their parents when they were seven to live in barracks.\nThey were regularly beaten, both as a form of discipline and to make them unafraid of pain.\nChildren with deformities of any kind were left in the elements to die, as were children maimed\nby the training regimen. Spartan boys were trained constantly in combat, maneuvering, and\nphysical endurance. Spartan girls were allowed to stay with their parents, but were trained in\nmartial skills as children as well, along with the knowledge they would need to run a household.\nWhen a man reached the age of twenty, assuming he was judged worthy, he would be elevated\nto the rank of \u201cEqual\u201d - a full Spartan citizen - and receive a land grant that ensured that he\ncould concentrate on military discipline for the rest of his life without having to worry about\nmaking a living.\nEven activities like courtship and acquiring nourishment were designed to test Spartans.\nWhen it was time for a young Spartan to marry, the young man would brawl his way into the\nfamily home of his bride-to-be, fighting her relatives until he could \u201ckidnap\u201d her \u2013 this was as\nclose to courtship as the Spartans got. Married couples were not allowed to live together before\nthe age of 30; up till then, the man was expected to sneak out of his bunker to see his wife, then\nsneak back in again before morning. In addition, Spartans in training were often forced to steal\nfood (from their own slave-run farms); they were punished if caught, but the infraction was being\ncaught, not the theft - the idea was that the future warrior had failed to live up to the required\nlevel of skill at stealth.\n85 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe reason for all of this militaristic mania was simple: Sparta was a slave society.\nApproximately 90% of the population of the area under Sparta's control were helots, serfs\ndescended from the population conquered by Sparta in the eighth century BCE. Early Spartan\nconquests of their region of Greece had resulted in a very large area under their control,\npopulated by people who were not Spartan. Rather than extend any kind of political\nrepresentation to these subjects, the Spartans instead maintained absolute control over them,\nup to the right of killing them at will with no legal consequence.\nEvery year, the Spartans would \u201cdeclare war\u201d on the helots, rampaging through their\nriver valley, and part of the training of young Spartans was serving on the Krypteia, the Spartan\nsecret police that infiltrated Helot villages to watch for signs of rebellion. Adolescent Spartans in\ntraining would even be dispatched to simply murder any helots they encountered. All of this\nwas to ensure that the helots would be too terrified and broken-spirited to resist Spartan\ndomination. There were never more than 8,000 Spartan soldiers, along with another 20,000 or\nso of free noncitizens (inhabitants of towns near Sparta who were not considered helots, but\ninstead free but subservient subjects), overseeing a much larger population of helots. Simply\nput, Spartan society was a military hierarchy that arose out of the fear of a massive slave\nuprising.\nLikewise, despite the famous, and accurate, accounts of key battles in which the\nSpartans were victorious, or at least symbolically victorious, they were loathe to be drawn into\nwars, especially ones that involved going more than a few days\u2019 march from Sparta. They were\nso preoccupied with maintaining control over the helots that they were very hesitant to engage\nin military campaigns of any kind, and hence rarely engaged in battles against other poleis\nbefore the outbreak of war against Athens in the fourth century BCE.\nThe only area in which Spartan society was actually less repressive than the rest of the\nGreek poleis was in gender roles. According to Greeks from outside of Sparta, free Spartan\nwomen were much less restricted than women elsewhere in Greece. They were trained in war,\nthey could speak publicly, and they could own land. They scandalized other Greeks by\nparticipating in athletics and appear to have benefited from a greater degree of personal\nfreedom than women anywhere else in Greece - of course, this would have been a social\nnecessity since the men of Sparta lived in barracks until they were 30, leaving the women to run\nhousehold estates.\n86 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nAthens\nIn many ways, Athens was the opposite of Sparta. Whereas the Spartans were\nmilitaristic and austere (the word \u201cspartan\u201d in English today means \u201csevere and unadorned\u201d), the\nAthenians celebrated art, music, and drama. While it still controlled a large slave population,\nAthens is also remembered as the birthplace of democracy. In turn, Sparta and Athens were,\nespecially in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, rivals for the position of the most powerful polis\nin Greece.\nAthens was rich and populous \u2013 the population of Attica, its 1,000-square-mile region of\nGreece, was about 600,000 by 600 BCE, and Athens was a major force in Mediterranean trade.\nThat wealth led to conflicts over its distribution among the citizens, in turn prompting some\nunprecedented political experiments. Starting early in the Archaic Age, Athens witnessed a\nseries of struggles and compromises between the aristocrats \u2013 wealthy land-owning families\nwho controlled most of the land and most of the political power \u2013 and everyone else, particularly\nthe free citizens and farmers of Athens who were not aristocrats. One key development in\nAthenian politics arose from the fact that merchants and prosperous farmers could afford arms\nand armor but were shut out of political decision-making. This was a classic case of hoplites\nbecoming increasingly angry with the political domination of the aristocracy.\nThe crisis of representation reached a boiling point in about 600 BCE when there was a\nreal possibility of civil war between the common citizens and the aristocrats. The major problem\nwas that the aristocrats owned most of the land that other farmers worked on, many of those\nfarmers were increasingly indebted to the aristocrats, and by Athenian law anyone who could\nnot pay off his or her debts could be legally enslaved. An increasing number of formerly-free\nAthenian citizens thus found themselves enslaved to pay off their debts to an aristocrat.\nTo prevent civil war, the Athenians appointed Solon (638 \u2013 558 BCE), an aristocratic but\nfair-minded politician, to serve as a tyrant and to reform institutions. His most important step in\nrestoring order was to cancel debts and to eliminate debt-slavery itself. He used public money to\nbuy Athenian slaves who had been enslaved abroad and bring them back to Athens. He\nenacted other legal reforms that reduced the overall power of the aristocracy, and in a savvy\nmove, he had the laws written down on wooden panels and posted around the city so that\nanyone who could read could examine them (up to that point, the only people who actually knew\nthe laws were the aristocratic judges, which made it all too easy for them to abuse their power).\n87 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nSolon was not some kind of rabble-rouser or proto-communist, however. He mitigated\nthe worst of the social divides between rich and poor in Athens, but he still reserved the highest\noffices for members of the richest families. On the other hand, the poorer free citizens were\ncompletely exempt from taxes, which made it easier for them to stay out of debt and to\ncontribute to Athenian society (and the military). Perhaps the most innovative and important of\nSolon\u2019s innovations was the concept of an impersonal state, one in which the politicians come\nand go but which continues on as an institution obeying written laws; this is in contrast to \u201cthe\nstate\u201d as just the ruling cabal of elite men, which Athens had been prior to Solon\u2019s intervention.\nThis pattern continued for about a century. Solon's successors were a collection of new\ntyrants, some of whom seized more land from aristocrats and distributed it to farmers, most of\nwhom sponsored new building projects, but none of whom definitively broke the power of the old\nfamilies. Social divides and tension continued to be the essential reality of Athenian society.\nIn 508 BCE, however, the Athenian assembly appointed a new tyrant named Cleisthenes, who\nfinally took the radical step of allowing all male citizens to have a vote in public matters and to\nbe eligible to serve in public office. This included free but poor citizens, the ones too poor to\nafford weapons and serve as hoplites. He had lawmakers chosen by lot (i.e. randomly) and\ncreated new \u201ctribes\u201d mixing men of different backgrounds together to force them to start to think\nof themselves as fellow Athenians, not just jealous protectors of their own families\u2019 interests.\nThus, under Cleisthenes, Athens became the first \u201creal\u201d democracy in history.\nThat being noted, by modern standards Athens was still highly unequal and\nunrepresentative. Women were completely excluded from political life, as were free non-citizens\n(including many prosperous Greeks who had not been born in Athens) and, of course, slaves.\nThe voting age was set at 20. Overall, about 40% of the population were native-born Athenians,\nof which half were men, and half were under 20, so only 10% of the actual population had\npolitical rights. This is still a very large percentage by the standards of the ancient world, but it\nshould be considered as an antidote to the idea that the Greeks believed in \u201cequality\u201d in a\nmodern sense.\nConclusion\nGreece managed to develop its unique political institutions and culture as part of a larger\nMediterranean \"world,\" trading with, raiding, and settling alongside many of the other\ncivilizations of the Iron Age. For centuries, Greece itself was too remote, geographically, and\ntoo poor, in terms of natural resources, to tempt foreign invaders to try to seize control. Starting\n88 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nin the sixth century BCE, however, some Greek colonies fell under the sway of the greatest\nempire the world had seen to date, and a series of events culminated in a full-scale war\nbetween the Greeks and that empire: Persia.\nImage Citations (Wikimedia Commons):\nSymposium - PD-1923\nGreek colonies - Regaliorum\nPhalanxes - Bibi Saint-Pol\n89 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nChapter 5: Persia and the Greek Wars\nPersia was one of the most significant ancient civilizations, a vast empire that was at the\ntime the largest the world had ever seen. It incorporated all of the ancient civilizations of the\nMiddle East, and at its height it even included Egypt. In other words, the entire expanse of land\nstretching from the borders of India to Greece, including nearly all of the cultures described in\nthe chapters above, were all conquered and controlled by the Persians.\nPersia itself corresponds with present-day Iran (the language of Iran today, Farsi, is a\ndirect linguistic descendent of ancient Persian). Most of its landmass is an arid plateau crossed\nby mountain ranges. In the ancient world, it was dominated by warriors on horseback who were\ngenerally perceived as \u201cbarbarians\u201d by the settled people of Mesopotamia to the west. By the\nseventh century BCE, a powerful collection of clans, the Medes, dominated Persia, forming a\nloosely-governed empire. In turn, the Medes ruled over a closely-related set of clans known as\nthe Persians, who would go on to rule territories far beyond the Iranian heartland.\nHistorians divide Persian history into periods defined by the founding clan of a given\nroyal dynasty. The empire described in this chapter is referred to as the Achaemenid Persian\nEmpire after its first ruling clan. Later periods of ancient Persian history, most importantly the\nParthian and Sasanian empires, are described in the chapters on ancient Rome.\nPersian Expansion\nThe Medes were allies of Babylon, and in 612 BCE they took part in the huge rebellion\nthat resulted in the downfall of the Assyrian Empire. For just over fifty years, the Medes\ncontinued to dominate the Iranian plateau. Then, in 550 BCE a Persian leader, Cyrus II the\nGreat, led the Persians against the Medes and conquered them (practically speaking, there was\nlittle distinction between the two groups since they were so closely related and similar; the\nGreeks regularly confused the two when writing about them). He assimilated the Medes into his\nown military force and then embarked on an incredible campaign of conquest that lasted twenty\nyears, forging Persia into a gigantic empire.\nCyrus began his conquests by invading Anatolia in 546 BCE, conquering the kingdom of\nLydia in the process. His principal targets further west were the Greek colonies of Ionia, along\nthe coast of the Aegean Sea. Cyrus swiftly defeated the Greek poleis, but instead of punishing\nthe Greeks for opposing him he allowed them to keep their language, religion, and culture,\n90 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nsimply insisting they give him loyal warriors and offer tribute. He found Greek leaders willing to\nwork with the Persians and he appointed them as governors of the colonies. Thus, even though\nthey had been beaten, most of the Greeks in the colonies did not experience Persian rule as\nparticularly oppressive.\nCyrus next turned south and conquered the city-states and kingdoms of Mesopotamia,\nculminating with his conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE. This conquest was surprisingly peaceful;\nBabylon was torn between the priests of Marduk (the patron deity of the city) and the king, who\nwas trying to favor the worship of a different goddess. After he defeated the forces of the king in\none battle, Cyrus was welcomed as a liberator by the Babylonians and he made a point of\nvenerating Marduk to help ensure their ongoing loyalty.\nMuch of what historians know about Persia is gleaned from the propaganda Persian\nkings left behind. The conquest of Babylon produced an outstanding example - the \u201cCyrus\nCylinder,\u201d a pillar covered in a proclamation that Cyrus commissioned after the conquest of\nBabylon.\nPart of the inscription reads: \u201cI am Cyrus, king of the world, great king, mighty king, king\nof Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four quarters, the son of Cambyses, great\nking, king of An\u0161an, grandson of Cyrus, great king, king of An\u0161an, descendant of Teispes, great\nking, king of An\u0161an, of an eternal line of kingship, whose rule B\u00eal and Nabu love, whose\nkingship they desire for their hearts' pleasure. When I entered Babylon in a peaceful manner, I\ntook up my lordly abode in the royal palace amidst rejoicing and happiness. Marduk, the great\nlord, established as his fate for me a magnanimous heart of one who loves Babylon, and I daily\nattended to his worship.\u201d\n91 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Cyrus Cylinder is a crucial source for understanding Persian rulership at its very\nbeginning. Cyrus established his authority on two principles: descent from other great kings and\nthe favor of the gods. He was the living representative of a supreme royal line of descent and\nan ensis in the Mesopotamian sense: the agent of the patron god on earth. Over time the\nidentity of the god in question became Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of the Zoroastrian\nreligion (described below) rather than Marduk, but the principle remained the same. All\nsubsequent Persian kings would cite these two principles, which when combined elevated them\nin authority above all other rulers.\nCyrus continued the practice of finding loyal leaders and treating his conquered enemies\nfairly, which kept uprisings against him to a minimum. He then pushed into Central Asia, in\npresent-day Afghanistan, conquering all of what constituted the \u201cknown world\u201d in that region. To\nthe northeast were the steppes, home of a steppe-dwelling nomadic people called the\nScythians, whom the Persians would go on to fight for centuries (Cyrus himself died in battle\nagainst the Scythians in 530 BCE - he was 70 years old at the time).\nCyrus was followed by his son Cambyses II. Cambyses led the Persian armies west,\nconquering both the rich Phoenician cities of the eastern Mediterranean coast and Egypt. He\nwas installed as pharaoh in Egypt, again demonstrating Persian respect for local traditions.\nThus, in less than thirty years, Persia had gone from an obscure kingdom in the middle of the\nIranian plateau to the largest land empire in the entire world, bigger even than China (under the\nEastern Zhou dynasty) at the time. Cambyses died not long after, in 522 BCE, under somewhat\nmysterious circumstances \u2013 he supposedly fell on his sword while getting off of his horse.\nIn 522, following Cambyses\u2019 death, Darius I became king (r. 521 \u2013 486 BCE). Darius\ncame to power after leading a conspiracy that may have assassinated Cambyses\u2019 younger\nbrother Bardiya, who had briefly ruled. In the midst of the political chaos at the top, a series of\nrevolts briefly shook the empire, but Darius swiftly crushed the uprisings and reasserted Persian\nrule. He captured his moment of triumph in a huge carved image on a rock wall (the \u201cBisitun\nInscription\u201d) which depicts his victory over lesser kings and traces his royal lineage back to a\nshared ancestor with Cyrus the Great.\nBy the time Darius came to power, the Persian Empire was already too large to rule\neffectively; it was bigger than any empire in the world to date but there was no infrastructure or\ngovernment sufficient to rule it consistently. Darius worked to change that. He expanded the\nempire further and, more importantly, consolidated royal power. He improved infrastructure,\nestablished a postal service, and standardized weights, measures, and coinage. He set up a\n92 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nuniform bureaucracy and system of rule over the entire empire to standardize taxation and\nmake it clear what was expected of the subject areas.\nThe Persian Empire at its territorial height under Darius I.\nDarius inherited the conquests of his predecessors, and he personally oversaw the\nconquest of the northern part of the Indus river valley in northwestern India, thus marking the\nfirst time in world history when one state ruled over three of the major river systems of ancient\nhistory (i.e. the Nile, Mesopotamia, and the Indus). In 513 BCE he led a gigantic invasion of\nCentral Asia to try to end the raids of the Scythians once and for all; he was forced to retreat\nwithout winning a decisive victory, but his army was still intact and he had added Thrace\n(present-day Bulgaria) to the empire.\nDarius was also interested in seizing more territory to the west, conquering the\nremaining Greek colonies on the coast of Anatolia. In 499 BCE several Ionian Greek poleis\nrose against the Persians and successfully secured Athenian aid. Several years of fighting\nfollowed, with the Persians eventually crushing the rebellion in 494 BCE (the Persians deported\n93 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nmany of the Greek rebels to India as punishment). Athens\u2019 decision to support the rebellion\nangered the Persians, however, and Darius began to plan a full-fledged invasion of Greece\n(considered below).\nThe Persian Government\nAn empire this big posed some serious logistical challenges. The Persians may have\nhad relatively loyal subjects, after all, but if it took months for messages to reach them, even\nloyal subjects could make decisions that the kings would disagree with. To help address this\nissue, Darius undertook a series of major reforms. The Persians continued the Assyrian\npractice of building highways and setting up supply posts for their messengers. The most\nimportant of these highways was called the Royal Road, linking up the empire all the way from\nwestern Anatolia to the Persian capital of Susa, just east of the Tigris. A messenger on the\nRoyal Road could cover 1,600 miles in a week on horseback, trading out horses at posts along\nthe way. The Persians standardized laws and issued regular coinage in both silver and gold.\nThe state used several languages to communicate with its subjects, and the government\nsponsored a major effort to standardize a new, simplified cuneiform alphabet.\nAs described above, the key to Persian rule was the novel innovation of treating\nconquered people with a degree of leniency (in stark contrast to the earlier methods of rule\nemployed by the Assyrians and Neo-Babylonians). So long as they were loyal, paid taxes, and\nsent troops when called, the Persian kings had no problem with letting their subjects practice\ntheir own religions, use their own languages, and carry on their own trading practices and\ncustoms. For example, it was Cyrus who allowed the exiled Jews to return to Judah from\nBabylon in the name of a kind of royal generosity. It seems that the Persian kings felt it very\nimportant to maintain an image of beneficence, of linking their power to sympathy for their\nsubjects, rather than trying to terrorize their subjects into submission.\nThe Persian kings introduced a system of governance that allowed them to gather\nintelligence and maintain control over such a vast area relatively successfully. The empire was\ndivided into twenty satrapies (provinces), ruled by officials called satraps. In each satrapy, the\nsatrap was the political governor, advised and supplemented by a military general who reported\ndirectly to the king; in this way, the two most powerful leaders in each satrapy could keep an eye\non each other. In addition, roaming officials called the \u201ceyes and ears of the king\u201d traveled\naround the empire checking that the king\u2019s edicts were being enforced and that conquered\npeople were not being abused, then reporting back to the Persian capitals of Susa and\n94 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nPersepolis (both cities served as royal capitals). Despite that system of political \u201cchecks and\nbalances,\u201d the satraps appointed the new king from the royal family when the old one died;\nsometimes they preferred to appoint weak-willed members of the royal family so that the satraps\nmight enjoy more personal freedom. Likewise, despite the innovations that Darius introduced in\norganization, the satraps normally operated with a large degree of autonomy.\nThe kings themselves adopted the title of \u201cKing of Kings.\u201d They were happy to\nacknowledge the authority of the rulers of the lands they had conquered, but required those\nrulers to in turn acknowledge the Persian king\u2019s overarching supremacy. Persian images of the\nkings depicted them receiving tribute from other, lesser kings who had come to Susa or\nPersepolis in a show of loyalty and support. In this way, the political authority of the empire was\ntied together by both the formal bureaucratic structure of the satrapies as well as the bonds of\nloyalty between the King of Kings and his subject rulers.\nOne final component of the Persian system was relatively modest taxation. In order to\nkeep taxes moderate, the Persian kings only called up armies (of both Persians and conquered\npeoples) when there was a war; otherwise the only permanent army was the 10,000-strong elite\nbodyguard of the king that the Greeks called the \u201cImmortals.\u201d When the Persians did go to war,\ntheir subjects contributed troops according to their strengths. The Phoenicians formed the navy,\nthe Medes the cavalry, the Mesopotamians the infantry, and so on. This system worked well on\nlong campaigns, but its weakness was that it took up to two years to mobilize the whole empire\nfor war, a serious issue in the conflicts between Persia and Greece in the long run.\nThe Achaemenid dynasty of Persia would rule for approximately two centuries, from\nCyrus\u2019s victories in 550 BCE to its conquest by Alexander the Great, completed in 330 BCE. It\nis worth noting that despite the relatively \u201cenlightened\u201d character of Persian rule, rebellions did\noccur (often starting in Egypt), most frequently during periods of transition or civil war between\nrival claimants to the throne. In a sense, the empire both benefited from and was made\nvulnerable by the autonomy of its subjects: each region maintained its own identity and\ntraditions, keeping everyday resentment to a minimum, but in moments of crisis that autonomy\nmight also lead to the demand for actual independence.\nZoroastrianism\nDespite the overall policy of religious tolerance, there was still a dominant Persian\nreligion: Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrianism, named after its prophet Zoroaster, taught that the world\nwas being fought over by two great powers: a god of goodness, honesty, and benevolence\nknown as Ahura Mazda (meaning \u201cLord Wisdom\u201d) and an evil spirit, Ahriman. Ahura Mazda\n95 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nwas aided by lesser gods like Mithras, god of the sun and rebirth, and Anahita, goddess of\nwater and the cosmos. Every time a person did something righteous, honest, or brave, Ahura\nMazda won a victory over Ahriman, while every time someone did something cruel, dishonest,\nor dishonorable Ahriman pushed back against Ahura Mazda. Thus, humans had a major role to\nplay in bringing about the final victory of Ahura Mazda through their actions.\nZoroaster himself lived far earlier (sometime between 1300 BCE and 1000 BCE), long\nbefore the rise of the empire, and was responsible for codifying the beliefs of the religion named\nafter him. Zoroaster claimed that Ahura Mazda was the primary god and would ultimately\ntriumph in the battle against evil, but explained the existence of evil in the world as a result of\nthe struggle against Ahriman. Thus, Ahura Mazda was not \u201call-powerful\u201d in quite the same way\nas the Jewish (and later Christian and Muslim) God was believed to be. Human actions\nmattered in this scheme because everyone played a role, however minor, in helping to bring\nabout order and righteousness or impeded progress by indulging in wickedness. Zoroastrianism\nalso told a specific story about the afterlife: when the power of good finally triumphs definitively\nover evil, those who lived righteously would live forever in the glorious presence of Ahura\nMazda, while those who were evil would suffer forever in a black pit.\nThere are obvious parallels here between Zoroastrianism and Jewish and Christian\nbeliefs. Indeed, there is a direct link between the Zoroastrian Ahriman and the Jewish and\nChristian figure of Satan, who was simply a dark spirit in the early books of the Torah but later\nbecame a distinct presence, the \u201cnemesis\u201d of God Himself and a threat to the order of the world,\nif not to God. Likewise, the Christian idea of the final judgment is clearly indebted to the\nZoroastrian one: a great day of reckoning.\nIn turn, Zoroastrianism provided a spiritual justification for the expansion of the Persian\nEmpire. Because the great kings believed that they were the earthly representatives of Ahura\nMazda, they claimed that the expansion of the empire would bring the final triumph of good over\nevil sooner. There was a parallel here to the beliefs of the ancient Egyptians, who had also\n(during their expansionist phase during the New Kingdom) claimed to be bringing order to a\nchaotic world at the end of a sword. The kings sponsored Zoroastrian temples and expanded\nthe faith at least in part because the faith supported them: the magi, or priests, preached in\nfavor of the continued power and expansion of the empire.\nOne noteworthy aspect of Zoroastrianism is that, in contrast to other ancient religions\n(including Judaism, and later, Christianity), Zoroastrianism appears to have banned slavery on\nspiritual grounds. This is important to bear in mind in the context of discussing the Persian War,\ndescribed below. The Greeks thought of the war as the defense of their glorious traditions,\n96 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nincluding the political participation of citizens in the state, but it was the Greeks who controlled a\nsociety that was heavily dependent on slavery, whereas slavery was at least less prevalent in\nPersia than in Greece (despite the religious ban, slavery was clearly still present in the Persian\nEmpire to some degree).\nAlmost all of the theological details about Zoroastrianism are known from much later\nperiods of Persian history, although historians have established that the Persian rulers\nthemselves were almost certainly Zoroastrians by the rule of Darius I. The importance of\nZoroastrianism is in part the fact that it reveals much about what the Persians valued, not just\nwhat they believed about the universe. Truth was the cardinal virtue of Zoroastrianism, with\nlying being synonymous with evil. Each person had a certain social role to play in the\nZoroastrian worldview, with the kings presiding over an ordered, loyal, prosperous society. In\ntheory, war was fought to extend righteousness, not just seize territory and loot. Clearly, there\nwas a sophisticated ethical code and set of social expectations present even in early\nZoroastrianism, reflected in a comment made by the Greek historian Herodotus. According to\nhim, the Persians taught their children three things: to ride a horse, to shoot a bow, and to tell\nthe truth.\nThe Persian War\nWhen the Greek cities of Ionia rose up against Persian rule, Darius vowed to make an\nexample not just of them, but of the Greek poleis that had aided them, including Athens. This\nled to the Persian War, one of the most famous conflicts in ancient history. It is remembered in\npart because it pitted an underdog, Greece, against a massive empire, Persia. It is remembered\nbecause the underdog won, at least initially. It is also remembered, unfortunately, for how the\nconflict was appropriated by proto-racist beliefs in the superiority of \u201cThe West.\u201d Because the\nGreeks saw the conflict in terms of the triumph of true, Greek, civilization over barbaric tyranny,\nand the surviving historical sources are told exclusively from the Greek perspective, this bias\nhas managed to last down until the present \u2013 consider the recent movie adaptations of the most\nfamous battles of the Persian War, 300 and 300: Rise of an Empire, in which the Persians are\ndepicted as being literally monstrous, ruled over by a comically evil, eight-foot-tall king. The fact\nthat both Sparta and Athens were slave-based societies is not part of those movies' narratives.\nThe war began in 490 BCE, when the Persians, with about 25,000 men, landed at\nMarathon, a town 26 miles from Athens. The Athenians sent a renowned runner, Pheidippides,\nto Sparta (about 140 miles from Athens) to ask for help. The Spartans agreed, but said that they\n97 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ncould only send reinforcements when their religious ceremonies were completed in a few days.\nPheidippides ran back to Athens with the bad news, but by then the Athenians were already\nengaged with the Persians.\nThere were about 25,000 Persian troops \u2013 this was an \u201cexpeditionary force,\u201d not a large\narmy, against which the Athenians fielded 10,000 hoplites. The Athenians marched out to\nconfront the Persians. The two armies camped out and watched each other for a few days, then\nthe Persians dispatched about 10,000 of their troops in naval transports to attack Athens\ndirectly; this prompted a gamble on the part of the leading Athenian general (named Miltiades)\nto attack the remaining Persians, rather than running back to Athens to defend it. The ensuing\nbattle was a decisive show of force for the Greeks: the citizen-soldier hoplites proved far more\neffective than the conscript infantry of the Persian forces. The core of the Persian army, its\nMedian and Persian cavalry, fought effectively against the Athenians, but once the Athenian\nwings closed in and forced back the infantry, the Persians were routed.\nThe Greeks were especially good at inflicting casualties without taking very many \u2013 the\nPersians supposedly lost 33 men to every Athenian lost in the battle (6,400 Persian dead to 192\nAthenians). There is also a questionable statistic from Greek sources that it was more than that\n\u2013 as many as 60 Persians per Athenian. Whatever the real number, it was a crushing victory for\nthe Athenians. A later (almost certainly fabricated) account of the aftermath of the battle claimed\nthat Pheidippides was then sent back to Athens, still running, to report the victory. He dropped\ndead of exhaustion, but in the process he ran the first \u201cmarathon.\u201d\nIt is entirely possible that, despite this victory, the Greeks would have still been\noverwhelmed by the Persians if not for setbacks in Persia and its empire. A major revolt broke\nout in Egypt against Persian rule, drawing attention away from Greece until the revolt was put\ndown. Likewise, it took years to fully \u201cactivate\u201d the Persian military machine; preparation for a\nfull-scale invasion took a full decade to reach completion. Darius died in 486 BCE, in the middle\nof the preparations, which disrupted them further while his son Xerxes consolidated his power.\nIn the meantime, the Greeks were well aware that the Persians would eventually return.\nA new Athenian general, Themistocles, convinced his countrymen to spend the proceeds of a\nsilver mine they had discovered on a navy. Athens went into a naval-building frenzy, ending up\nwith hundreds of warships called triremes, rowed by those free Athenians too poor to afford\narmor and weapons and serve as hoplites, but who now had an opportunity to directly aid in\nbattle as sailors. This was perhaps the first time in world history that a fairly minor power\ntransformed itself into a major power simply by having the foresight to build an effective navy.\n98 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Persians had finally regrouped by 480 BCE, ten years after their first attempt to\ninvade. Xerxes I, the new king, dispatched a huge army (as many as 200,000 soldiers and\n1,200 ships) against Greece, supported by a navy over twice as large as that of the Athenians.\nThe Greek poleis were, for the most part, terrified into submission, with only about 6% of the\nGreek cities joining into the defensive coalition created by Athens and Sparta (that being said,\nwithin that 6% were some of the most powerful poleis in Greece). The Spartans took leadership\nof the land army that would block the Persians in the north while the Athenians attacked the\nPersian navy in the south.\nRoute of the Persian invasion under Xerxes.\nThe Spartan-led force was very small compared to the Persian army, but for several\ndays they held the Persians back at the Battle of Thermopylae, a narrow pass in which the\nPersians were unable to deploy the full might of their (much larger) army against the Greeks.\nThe Spartan king, Leonidas, and his troops held the Persian forces in place until the Spartans\nwere betrayed by a Greek hired by the Persians into revealing a path that allowed the Persians\nto surround the Greeks and, finally, overwhelm them. Despite the ultimate defeat of the Spartan\nforce, this delay gave the Athenians enough time to get their navy into position, and they\ncrushed the Persian navy in a single day.\nDespite the Persian naval loss, Xerxes\u2019 army was easily able to march across Greece\nand ransack various poleis and farmlands; it even sacked Athens itself, which had been\nevacuated earlier. Xerxes then personally withdrew along with a significant portion of his army,\n99 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nwhile claiming victory over the Greeks. Here, simple logistics were the issue: the Greek naval\nvictory made supply of the whole Persian army impractical.\nThe next year, in 479 BCE, a decisive battle was fought in central Greece by a Greek\ncoalition led by the Spartans, followed by a Greek naval battle led by the Athenians. The latter\nthen led an invasion of Ionia that defeated the Persian army. Each time the Greeks were\nvictorious, and the Persians finally decided to abandon the attempt to conquer Greece as being\ntoo costly. The remaining Greek colonies in Anatolia rose up against the Persians, and sporadic\nfighting continued for almost 20 years.\nWhile there is obviously a pro-Greek bias to the Greek sources that describe the Persian\nWar, they do identify an essential reason for Greek victories: thanks to the viability of the\nphalanx, each Greek soldier (from any polis, not just Sparta) was a real, viable soldier. The\nimmense majority of the Persian forces were relatively ineffective peasant conscripts, unwillingly\nrecruited from their homes and forced to fight for a king for whom they had little personal loyalty.\nThe core of the Persian army were excellent cavalry from the Iranian plateau and Bactria\n(present-day Afghanistan), but those were always a small minority of the total force.\n479 BCE was the end of the Persian war and the beginning of the \u201cclassical age\u201d of\nGreece. During this period, the Greeks exhibited the most remarkable flowering of their ideas\nand accomplishments, as well as perhaps their most selfish and misguided political blundering\nin the form of a costly and ultimately pointless war between Sparta and Athens: the\nPeloponnesian War.\nThe Peloponnesian War\nWhen the Spartans and Athenians led the Greek poleis to victory against the Persians in\nthe Persian War, it was a shock to the entire region of the Mediterranean and Middle East.\nPersia was the regional \u201csuperpower\u201d at the time, while the Greeks were just a group of\ndisunited city-states on a rocky peninsula to the northwest. After their success, the Greeks were\nfilled with confidence about the superiority of their own form of civilization and their taste for\ninquiry and innovation. Greeks in this period, the Classical Age, produced many of their most\nmemorable cultural and intellectual achievements.\nThe great contrast in the Classical Age was between the power and splendor of the\nGreek poleis, especially Athens and Sparta, and the wars and conflicts that broke out as they\ntried to expand their power and control. After the defeat of the Persians, the Athenians created\nthe Delian League, in theory a defensive coalition that existed to defend against Persia and to\n100 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nliberate the Ionian colonies still under Persian control, but in reality a political tool eventually\nused by Athens to create its own empire.\nEach year, the members of the Delian League contributed money to build and support a\nlarge navy, meant to protect all of Greece from any further Persian interference. Athens,\nhowever, quickly became the dominant player in the Delian League. Athens was able to control\nthe League due to its powerful navy; no other polis had a navy anywhere near as large or\neffective, so the other members of the League had to contribute funds and supplies while the\nAthenians fielded the ships. Thus, it was all too easy for Athens to simply use the League to\ndrain the other poleis of wealth while building up its own power. The last remnants of Persian\ntroops were driven from the Greek islands by 469 BCE, about ten years after the great Greek\nvictories of the Persian War, but Athens refused to allow any of the League members to resign\nfrom the League after the victory.\nSoon, Athens moved from simply extracting money to actually imposing political control\nin other poleis. Athens stationed troops in garrisons in other cities and forced the cities to adopt\nnew laws, regulations, and taxes, all designed to keep the flow of money going to Athens. Some\nof the members of the League rose up in armed revolts, but the Athenians were able to crush\nthe revolts with little difficulty. The final event that eliminated any pretense that the League was\nanything but an Athenian empire was the failure of a naval expedition sent in 460 BCE by\nAthens to help an Egyptian revolt against the Persians. The Greek expedition was crushed, and\nthe Athenians responded by moving the treasury of the League, formerly kept on the Greek\nisland of Delos (hence \u201cDelian League\u201d), to Athens itself, arguing that the treasury was too\nvulnerable if it remained on Delos. At this point, no other member of the League could do\nanything about it \u2013 the League existed as an Athenian-controlled empire, pumping money into\nAthenian coffers and allowing Athens to build some of its most famous and beautiful buildings.\nThus, the great irony is that the most glorious age of Athenian democracy and philosophy was\nfunded by the extraction of wealth from its fellow Greek cities. In the end, the Persians simply\nmade peace with Athens in 448 BCE, giving up the claim to the Greek colonies entirely and in\nturn eliminating the very reason the League had come into being.\nMeanwhile, Sparta was the head of a different association, the Peloponnesian League,\nwhich was originally founded before the Persian War as a mutual protection league of the Greek\ncities of Corinth, Sparta, and Thebes. Like Athens, Sparta dominated its allies, although it did\nnot take advantage of them in quite the same ways that Athens did. Sparta was resentful and, in\na way, fearful of Athenian power. Open war finally broke out between the two cities in 431 BCE\n101 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nafter two of their respective allied poleis started a conflict and Athens tried to influence the\npolitical decisions of Spartan allies. The war lasted from 431 \u2013 404 BCE.\nThe Spartans were unquestionably superior in land warfare, while the Athenians had a\nseemingly unstoppable navy. The Spartans and their allies repeatedly invaded Athenian\nterritory, but the Athenians were smart enough to have built strong fortifications that held the\nSpartans off. The Athenians, in turn, attacked Spartan settlements and positions overseas and\nused their navy to bring in supplies. While Sparta could not take Athens itself, Athens was\nessentially under siege for decades; life went on, but it was usually impossible for the Athenians\nto travel over land in Greece outside of their home region of Attica.\nAthens and its allies, including the poleis it dominated in the Delian League, are depicted in\norange, Sparta and its allies in green.\nTruces came and went, but the war continued for almost thirty years. In 415 BCE Athens\nsuffered a disaster when a young general convinced the Athenians to send thousands of troops\nagainst the city of Syracuse (a Spartan ally) in southern Sicily, hundreds of miles from Greece\n102 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nitself, in hopes of looting it. The invasion turned into a nightmare for the Athenians, with every\nship captured or sunk and almost every soldier killed or captured and sold into slavery; this\ndramatically weakened the Athenian military.\nAt that point, the Athenians were on the defensive. The Spartans established a\npermanent garrison within sight of Athens itself. Close to 20,000 slaves escaped from the\nAthenian silver mines that had originally paid for the navy before the Persian War and were\nwelcomed by the Spartans as recruits (thus bolstering Spartan forces and cutting off Athens'\nmain source of revenue). Sparta finally struck a decisive blow in 405 BCE by surprising the\nAthenian fleet in Anatolia and destroying it. Athens had to sue for peace. Sparta destroyed the\nAthenian defenses it had used during the war, but did not destroy the city itself, and within a\nyear the Athenians had created a new government.\nThe Aftermath\nGreece itself was transformed by the Peloponnesian War. Both sides had sought out\nallies outside of Greece, with the Spartans ultimately allying with the Persians \u2013 formerly their\nhated enemies \u2013 in the final stages of the war. The Greeks as a whole were less isolated and\nmore cosmopolitan by the time the war ended, meaning that at least some of their prejudices\nabout Greek superiority were muted. Likewise, the war had inadvertently undermined the\nhoplite-based social and political order of the prior centuries.\nNowhere was this more true than in Sparta. Sparta had been transformed by the war, out\nof necessity becoming both a naval power and a diplomatic \u201cplayer\u201d and losing much of its\nformer identity; some Spartans had gotten rich and were buying their sons out of the\nformerly-obligatory life in the barracks, while others were too poor to train. Likewise, the war had\nweakened Sparta\u2019s cultural xenophobia and obsession with austerity, since controlling\ndiplomatic alliances was as important as sheer military strength. Diplomacy required skill,\nculture, and education, not just force of arms. Subsequently, the Greeks as a whole were\nshocked in 371 BCE when the polis of Thebes defeated the Spartans three times in open battle,\nsymbolically marching to within sight of Sparta itself and destroying the myth of Spartan\ninvincibility.\nAcross Greece, the Poleis adopted the practice of enlisting state-financed standing\narmies for the first time, rather than relying on volunteer citizen-soldiers. Likewise, the poleis\ncame to rely on mercenaries, many of whom (ironically) went on to serve the Persians after the\nwar wound down. Thus, between 405 BCE \u2013 338 BCE, the old order of the hoplites and\nrepublics atrophied, replaced by oligarchic councils or tyrants in the poleis and stronger,\n103 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ntax-supported states. The period of the war itself was thus both the high point and the beginning\nof the end of \u201cclassical\u201d Greece. Meanwhile, Persia re-captured and exerted control over the\nAnatolian Greek cities by 387 BCE as Greece itself was divided and weakened. Thus, even\nthough the Persians had \u201clost\u201d the Persian War, they were as strong as ever as an empire.\nDespite the importance of the Peloponnesian War in transforming ancient Greece,\nhowever, it should be emphasized that not all of the poleis were involved in the war, and there\nwere years of truce and skirmishing during which even the major antagonists were not actively\ncampaigning. The reason that this part of Greek history is referred to as the Classical Age is\nthat its lasting achievements had to do with culture and learning, not warfare. The\nPeloponnesian War ultimately resulted in checking Athens' imperial ambitions and causing the\nGreeks to broaden their outlook toward non-Greeks; its effects were as much cultural as\npolitical. Those effects are the topic of the next chapter.\nImage Citations (Wikimedia Commons):\nCyrus cylinder - Mike Peel\nMap of Persia - Sumerophile\nPersian invasion - GNU Free Documentation License\nPeloponnesian War - Public Domain\nQuote:\nCyrus Cylinder\n104 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nChapter 6: The Classical Age of Greece\nIntroduction\nThe most frequently studied period of Greek history is the \u201cClassical Age,\u201d the time\nbetween the triumph of the Greek coalition against Persia in 479 BCE and the conquest of\nGreece by the Macedonian king Philip II (the father of Alexander the Great) in 338 BCE. This\nwas the era in which the Greek poleis were at their most powerful economically and militarily\nand their most innovative and productive artistically and intellectually. While opinions will vary,\nperhaps the single most memorable achievement of the Classical Age was in philosophy, first\nand foremost because the era generated the most significant Greek philosophers of all time:\nSocrates, Plato, and Aristotle. The Classical Age (like the European Renaissance about two\nthousand years later) is best remembered for its artistic and intellectual achievements rather\nthan the political events of the time.\nAthens and the Ironies of Democracy\nJust as the Classical Age is nearly synonymous with \u201cancient Greece\u201d itself, \u201cancient\nGreece\u201d in the Classical Age is often conflated with what happened in Athens specifically.\nAthens was the richest and most influential of all of the Greek poleis during this period, although\nits power waned once it plunged into the Peloponnesian War against Sparta starting in 431\nBCE. The most famous Greek philosophers \u2013 Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle \u2013 were either\nnative Athenians (Socrates and Plato) or studied and taught in Athens (Aristotle). Likewise, the\nAthenian democracy that had crystallized under Cleisthenes, with about 10% of the overall\npopulation having a vote in public affairs, was at its height during this period.\nThe irony was not just that Athens reached its peak during the period of the Delian\nLeague and the wealth it extracted from other poleis, it was that Athenian democracy itself was\nat its strongest: even as it was forging an empire on top of the other city-states, Athens was\nbecoming the first great experiment in democratic government in world history. The Athenian\nleader in charge during the transition to this phase was Pericles (495 \u2013 429 BCE), an aristocrat\nwho dominated Athenian politics but did not actually seize power as had the earlier tyrants.\n105 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nWhen Pericles rose to be a dominant voice in Athenian politics, the system remained in\nplace that had been set up by Cleisthenes. All adult male citizens had a vote in the public\nassembly, while a smaller council handled day-to-day business. Athenian citizens continued to\npride themselves on their rhetorical skill, since everything hinged on the ability of public\nspeakers to convince their fellows through strength of argumentation. The assembly also voted\nevery year to appoint ten generals who were in charge of both the military and foreign relations.\nAs the Delian League grew, which is to say as Athens took over control of its \u201callied\u201d\npoleis, it increased the size of its bureaucracy accordingly. Under Pericles, there were about\n1,500 officials who managed the taxation of the league's cities, ran courts and administrative\nbodies, and managed the League\u2019s activities. Pericles instituted the policy of paying public\nservants, who had worked for free in the past, a move that dramatically decreased the potential\nfor corruption through bribes and opened the possibility of poorer citizens to serve in public\noffice (i.e. before, a citizen had to be wealthy enough to volunteer in the city government - this\nmeant that almost all farmers and small merchants were cut off from direct political power). He\nalso issued a new law decreeing that only the children of Athenian parents could be Athenian\ncitizens, a move that elevated the importance of Athenian women but also further entrenched\nthe conceit of the Athenians in relation to the other Greek cities; the Athenians wanted\ncitizenship to be their own, carefully protected, commodity. All of this suggests that Athens\nenjoyed a tremendous period of growth and prosperity, along with what was among the fairest\nand most impartial governments in the ancient world at the time, but that it did so on the backs\nof its Greek \u201callies.\u201d\nThere were further ironies present in the seeming egalitarianism of Greek society during\nthe Classical Age. The Greeks were the first to carry out experiments in rationalistic philosophy\nand in democratic government. At the same time, Greek society itself was profoundly divided\nand unequal. First and foremost, women were held in a subservient position. Women, by\ndefinition, could not be citizens, even though in certain cases like the Athens of Pericles, they\ncould assume an honored social role as mothers of citizens. Women could not hold public\noffice, nor could they legally own property or defend themselves independently in court. They\nwere, in short, legal minors (like children are in American society today) under the legal control\nand guardianship of their fathers or husbands.\nFor elite Greek women, social restrictions were stark: they were normally confined to the\ninner sanctums of homes, interacting only with family members or close female friends from\nfamilies of the same social rank, and when they did go out in public they had to do so in the\ncompany of chaperones. There was never a time when it was socially acceptable for an elite\n106 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nwoman to be alone in public. Just about the only social position in which elite women had real,\ndirect power was in the priesthoods of some of the Greek gods, where women could serve as\npriestesses. These were a very small minority, however.\nNon-elite women had more freedom in the sense that they had to work, so they often\nsold goods in the marketplace or helped to run shops. Since the large majority of the Greek\npopulation outside of the cities themselves were farmers, women naturally worked alongside\nmen on farms. Regardless, they did not have legal control over their own livelihoods, even if\nthey did much of the actual work, with their husbands (or fathers or brothers) retaining complete\nlegal ownership.\nIn almost all cases, Greek women were married off while extremely young, usually soon\nafter puberty, and almost always to men significantly older than they were. Legal power over a\nwoman passed from the father to the husband, and in cases of divorce it passed back to the\nfather. Even in the case of widows, Greek tradition held that the husband's will should dictate\nwho his widow should marry - most often another male member of his family, to keep the family\nproperty intact. One important exception to the absence of legal rights for women was that\nGreek women could initiate divorce, although the divorce would be recognized only after a legal\nprocess proved that the husband\u2019s behavior was truly reprehensible to Greek sensibilities, and it\nwas a rare occurrence either way: there is only one known case from classical Athens of a\nwoman attempting to initiate divorce.\nIn the domestic sphere, there were physical divides between the front, public part of the\nhouse where men entertained their friends, and the back part of the house where women cared\nfor the children and carried on domestic tasks like sewing. There was little tradition of\nmixed-sex socializing, outside of the all-male drinking parties called symposia that featured\nfemale \u201centertainers\u201d \u2013 slaves and servants who carried on conversation, danced and sang, and\nhad sex with the guests. In these cases, the female \u201ccompany\u201d was present solely for\nentertainment and sexual slavery.\n107 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nDepiction of a symposium from c. 420 BCE, featuring a female entertainer - most likely a slave\nand obliged to provide sex as well as musical entertainment to the male guests.\nIn turn, prostitution was very common, with the bulk of prostitutes being slaves. Elite\nprostitutes were known as hetairai, who served as female companions for elite men and were\nsupposed to be able to contribute to witty, learned discussion. One such hetairai, Aspasia, was\nthe companion of Pericles and was a full member of the elite circle of philosophers, scientists,\nand politicians at the top of Athenian society. The difficulty in considering these special cases,\nhowever, is that they can gloss over the fact that the vast majority of women were confined in a\ndisempowered social space, regarded as a social necessity that existed to bear children. An\nAthenian politician, Demosthenes, once said \u201cwe have hetairai for the sake of pleasure, regular\nprostitutes to care for our physical needs, and wives to bear legitimate children and be loyal\ncustodians of our households.\u201d\nIt is difficult to know the degree to which female seclusion was truly practiced, since all of\nthe commentary that refers to it was written by elite men, almost all of whom supported the idea\nof female subservience and the separation of the sexes in public. What we know for sure is that\nalmost no written works survive by women authors - the outstanding exception being Sappho, a\npoet of the Archaic period whose works suggest that lesbianism may have been relatively\ncommon (her home, the Greek island of Lesbos, is the root of the English word lesbian itself).\nLikewise, Greek legal codes certainly enforced a stark gender divide, and Greek homes were\ndefinitely divided into male-dominated public spaces and the private sphere of the family. There\n108 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nis at least some evidence, however, that gender divisions might not have been quite as stark as\nthe male commentators would have it - as noted below, at least one Greek playwright\ncelebrated the wit and fortitude of women in his work. Finally, we should note that major\ndifferences in gender roles were definitely present in different regions and between different\npoleis; regimented Sparta was far more progressive in its empowerment of women than was\ndemocratic Athens.\nOne product of the divide between men and women was the prevalence of bisexuality\namong elite Greek men (and, as suggested by Sappho\u2019s work, also apparently among women).\nThere was no concept of \u201cheterosexual\u201d versus \u201chomosexual\u201d in Greek culture; sexual attraction\nwas assumed to exist, in potential, between men as easily as between men and women,\nalthough bisexuality appears to have been most common among men in the upper social ranks.\nOne common practice was for an adult man of the elite classes to \u201cadopt\u201d a male adolescent of\nhis social class and both mentor him in politics, social conduct, and war, and carry on what we\nwould now regard as a statutory sexual relationship with him - this practice was especially\ncommon in the barracks society of Sparta.\nBuilding on the prevalence of male relationships was the Greek tradition of male\nhomosexual warriorhood, homosexual bonds between soldiers that helped them be more\neffective fighters. To cite a literary example, in Homer\u2019s Iliad, the one event that rouses the\nmighty warrior Achilles to battle when he is busy sulking is the death of his (male) lover. In\naddition to the Spartan case noted above, another renowned historical example of homosexual\nwarriorhood was the Sacred Band of the polis of Thebes, 150 male couples who led the army of\nThebes and held the reputation of being completely fearless. Homosexual love in this case was\nlinked directly to the Greek virtues of honor and skill in battle, as the Sacred Band were believed\nto fight all the harder in order to both honor and defend their lovers. This certainly seemed to be\ntrue at times, as when the Theban army, led by the Sacred Band, was the first to defeat Sparta\nin open battle (this occurred after the Peloponnesian War, when Sparta found itself warring with\nits former allies like Thebes).\nIn addition to the dramatic gender disparities in Greek society, there was the case of\nslavery. Slaves in Greece were in a legal position just about as dire as any in history. Their\nmasters could legally kill them, rape them, or maim them if they saw fit. Normally, slaves were\nnot murdered outright, but this was because murder was seen as offensive to the gods, not\nbecause there were any legal consequences. As Greece became more wealthy and powerful,\nthe demand for slaves increased dramatically as each poleis found itself in need of more labor\n109 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\npower, so a major goal for warfare became the capturing of slaves. By 450 BCE, one-third of\nthe population of Athens and its territories consisted of slaves.\nSlaves in Greece came from many sources. While the practice was outlawed in Athens\nby Solon, most poleis still allowed the enslavement of their own people who were unable to pay\ndebts. More common was the practice of taking slaves in war, and one of the effects of the\nGreek victories in the Persian War was that thousands of Persian captives were taken as\nslaves. There was also a thriving slave trade between all of the major civilizations of the ancient\nworld; African slaves were captured and sold in Egypt, Greek slaves to Persia (despite its\nnominal ban on slavery, it is clear that at least some slavery existed in Persia), nomadic people\nfrom the steppes in Black Sea ports, and so on. With demand so high, any neighboring\nsettlement was a potential source of slaves, and slavery was an integral part of the\nMediterranean economy as a result.\nSlavery was so prevalent that what the slaves actually did varied considerably. Some\nvery lucky slaves who were educated ran businesses or served as bureaucrats, teachers, or\naccountants. In a small number of cases, such elite slaves were able to keep some of the\nmoney they made, save it, and buy their freedom. Rarest of all were slaves who were\nremembered by later Greeks for their accomplishments. Easily the most important and well\nknown example was Aesop, credited with compiling a book of fables that are still in print to this\nday, and some of which (e.g. The Tortoise and the Hare) have become common tropes in\nWestern thought. The stories about Aesop\u2019s life which have survived propose an ideal of an\nelite slave who achieves freedom and a measure of fame through the pursuit of the elevated\ncultural endeavors valued by the Greeks.\nNeedless to say, for every Aesop were countless slaves about whom we know almost\nnothing. Most were laborers or craftsmen of all kinds, who made things and then sold them on\nbehalf of their masters. Slaves even served as clerks in the public bureaucracies, as well as\npolice and guard forces in the cities. One exceptional case was a force of archers used as city\nguards in Athens who were slaves from Scythia (present-day Ukraine). The worst positions for\nslaves were the jobs involving manual labor, especially in mines. As noted in the last chapter,\none of the events that lost the Peloponnesian War for Athens was the fact that 20,000 of its\npublicly-owned slaves were liberated by the Spartans from the horrendous conditions in the\nAthenian silver mines. Likewise, there was no worse fate than being a slave in a salt mine (one\nof the areas containing a natural underground salt deposit). Salt is corrosive to human tissue in\nlarge amounts, and exposure meant that a slave would die horribly over time. The historical\n110 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nevidence suggests that slaves in mines were routinely worked to death, not unlike the plantation\nslaves of Brazil and the Caribbean thousands of years later.\nCulture\nIf Greek society was thus nothing like present-day concepts of fairness or equality, what\nabout it led to this era being regarded as \u201cclassical\u201d? The answer is that it was during the\nClassical Age that the Greeks arrived at some of their great intellectual and cultural\nachievements. The Athenian democratic experiment is, of course, of great historical\nimportance, but it was relatively short-lived, with democratic government not returning to the\nWestern world until the end of the eighteenth century CE. In contrast, the Greek approach to\nphilosophy, drama, history, scientific thought, and art remained living legacies even after the\nClassical Age itself was at an end.\nThe fundamental concept of Greek thought, as reflected in drama, literature, and\nphilosophy, was humanism. This was an overarching theme and phenomenon common to all of\nthe most important Greek cultural achievements in literature, religion, drama, history-writing, and\nart. Humanism is the idea that, first and foremost, humankind is inherently beautiful, capable,\nand creative. To the Greek humanists, human beings were not put on the earth to suffer by\ncruel gods, but instead carried within the spark of godlike creativity. Likewise, a major theme of\nhumanism was a pragmatic indifference to the gods and fate - one Greek philosopher,\nXenophanes, dismissed the very idea of human-like gods who intervened in daily life. The basic\nhumanistic attitude is that if there are any gods, they do not seem particularly interested in what\nhumans do or say, so it is better to simply focus on the tangible world of human life. The Greeks\nthus offered sacrifices to keep the gods appeased, and sought out oracles for hints of what the\nfuture held, but did not normally pursue a deeply spiritual connection with their deities.\nThat being noted, one of the major cultural innovations of the Greeks, the creation of\ndrama, emerged from the worship of the gods. Specifically, the celebrations of the god\nDionysus, god of wine and revelry, brought about the first recognizable \u201cplays\u201d and \u201cactors.\u201d Not\nsurprisingly, religious festivals devoted to Dionysus involved a lot of celebrating, and part of that\ncelebration was choruses of singing and chanting. Greek writers started scripting these\nperformances, eventually creating what we now recognize as plays. A prominent feature of\nGreek drama left over from the Dionysian rituals remained the chorus, a group of performers\nwho chanted or sang together and served as the narrator to the stories depicted by the main\ncharacters.\n111 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nContemporary view of the remnants of the Greek theater of Lychnidos in present-day\nMacedonia. The upper tiers are still marked with the names of the wealthy individuals who\npurchased their own reserved seats.\nGreek drama depicted life in human terms, even when using mythological or ancient\nsettings. Playwrights would set their plays in the past or among the gods, but the experiences\nof the characters in the plays were recognizable critiques of the playwrights' contemporary\nsociety. Among the most powerful were the tragedies: stories in which the frailty of humanity,\nmost importantly the problem of pride, served to undermine the happiness of otherwise powerful\nindividuals. Typically, in a Greek tragedy, the main character is a powerful male leader, a king or\na military captain, who enjoys great success in his endeavors until a fatal flaw of his own\npersonality and psyche causes him to do something foolish and self-destructive. Very often this\ntook the form of hubris, overweening pride and lack of self-control, which the Greeks believed\nwas offensive to the gods and could bring about divine retribution. Other tragedies emphasized\nthe power of fate, when cruel circumstances conspired to lead even great heroes to failure.\n112 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nIn addition to tragedy, the Greeks invented comedy. The essential difference is that\ntragedy revolves around pathos, or suffering, from which the English word \u201cpathetic\u201d derives.\nPathos is meant to inspire sympathy and understanding in the viewer. Watching a Greek\ntragedy should, the playwrights hoped, lead the audience to relate to and sympathize with the\ntragic hero. Comedy, however, is meant to inspire mockery and gleeful contempt of the failings\nof others, rather than sympathy. The most prominent comic playwright (whose works survive)\nwas Aristophanes, a brilliant writer whose plays are full of lying, hypocritical Athenian politicians\nand merchants who reveal themselves as the frauds they are to the delight of audiences.\nOne famous play by Aristophanes, Lysistrata, was set in the Peloponnesian War. The\nwomen of Athens are fed up with the pointless conflict and use the one thing they have some\npower over, their bodies, to force the men to stop the fighting by withholding sex. A Spartan\ncontingent appears begging to open peace negotiations because, it turns out, the Spartan\nwomen have done the same thing. Here, Aristophanes not only indulged in the ribald humor\nthat was popular with the Greeks (even by present-day standards, Lysistrata is full of \u201cdirty\u201d\njokes) but showed a remarkable awareness of, and sympathy for, the social position of Greek\nwomen. In fact, in plays like Lysistrata we see evidence that Greek women were not in fact\nalways secluded and rendered mute by male-dominated society, even though (male) Greek\ncommentators generally argued that they should be.\nGreek drama, both tragedy and comedy, is of enormous historical importance because\neven when it used the gods as characters or fate as an explanation for problems, it put human\nbeings front and center in being responsible for their own errors. It depicted human choice as\nbeing the centerpiece of life against a backdrop of often uncontrollable circumstances. Tragedy\ngave the Greeks the option of lamenting that condition, while comedy offered the chance of\nlaughing at it. In the surviving plays of the ancient Greeks, there were very few happy endings,\nbut plenty of opportunities to relate to the fate of, or make fun of, the protagonists. In turn,\nalmost every present-day movie and television show is deeply indebted to Greek drama. Greek\ndrama was the first time human beings acted out stories that were meant to entertain, and\nsometimes to inform, their audiences.\nScience\nThe idea that there is a difference between \"science\" and \"philosophy\" is a very recent\none, in many ways dating to the eighteenth century CE (i.e. only about 300 years ago). The\nword \"philosophy\" literally means \"love of knowledge,\" and in the ancient world the people we\nmight identify as Greek \"scientists\" were simply regarded as philosophers by their fellow\n113 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nGreeks, ones who happened to be especially interested in how the world worked and what\nthings were made of. Unlike earlier thinkers, the Greek scientists sought to understand the\noperation of the universe on its own terms, without simply writing off the details to the will of the\ngods.\nThe importance of Greek scientific work is not primarily in the conclusions that Greek\nscientists reached, which ended up being factually wrong most of the time. Instead, its\nimportance is in its spirit of rational inquiry, in the idea that the human mind can discover new\nthings about the world through examination and consideration. The world, thought the Greek\nscientists, was not some sacred or impenetrable thing that could never be understood; they\nsought to explain it without recourse to supernatural forces. To that end, Greek scientists\nclaimed that things like wind, fire, lightning, and other natural forces, were not necessarily spirits\nor gods (or at least tools of spirits and gods), but might just be natural forces that did not have\npersonalities of their own.\nThe first known Greek scientist was Thales of Miletus (i.e. Thales, and the students of\nhis who went on to be important scientific thinkers as well, were from the polis of Miletus in\nIonia), who during the Archaic Age set out to understand natural forces without recourse to\nreferences to the gods. Thales explained earthquakes not as punishments inflicted by the gods\narbitrarily on humanity, but as a result of the earth floating in a gigantic ocean that occasionally\nsloshed it around. He traveled to Egypt and was able to measure the height of the pyramids\n(already thousands of years old) by the length of their shadows. He became so skilled at\nastronomy that he (reputedly) successfully predicted a solar eclipse in 585 BCE.\nThales had a student, Anaximander, who posited that rather than floating on water as his\nteacher had suggested, the earth was held suspended in space by a perfectly symmetrical\nbalance of forces. He created the first known map of the world that attempted to accurately\ndepict distances and relationships between places. Following Anaximander, a third scientist,\nAnaximenes, created the theory of the four elements that, he argued, comprise all things \u2013\nearth, air, fire, and water. Many centuries later, Galen of Pergamon, a Greek physician living\nunder Roman rule, would explain human health in terms of the balance of those four forces (the\nfour \u201chumors\u201d of the body), ultimately crafting a medical theory that would persist until the\nmodern era.\nIn all three cases, the significance of the Greek scientists is that they tried to create\ntheories to explain natural phenomena based on what they observed in nature itself. They were\nemploying a form of what is referred to as inductive reasoning, of starting with observation and\nmoving toward explanation. Even though it was (as it turns out) inaccurate, the idea of the four\n114 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nelements as the essential building-blocks of nature and health remained the leading explanation\nfor many centuries. The practice of inductive reasoning led to many subsequent advancements;\nmost importantly when two Greek scholars (Leucippus and Democritus) came up with the idea\nthat tiny particles they called atoms formed the elements that, in turn, formed everything else. It\nwould take until the development of modern chemistry for that theory to be proved correct\nthrough empirical research, however.\nHistory\nIt was the Greeks that came up with history in the same sense that the term is used\ntoday, namely of a story (a narrative) based on historical events that tries to explain what\nhappened and why it happened the way it did. In other words, history as it was first written by\nthe Greeks is not just about listing facts, it is about explaining the human motivations at work in\nhistorical events and phenomena. Likewise, the Greeks were the first to systematically employ\nthe essential historical method of using primary sources written or experienced at the time as\nthe basis of historical research.\nThe founding figure of Greek history-writing was Herodotus (484 \u2013 420 BCE), who wrote\na history of the Persian War that was acclaimed by his fellow Greeks. Herodotus sought to\nexplain human actions in terms of how people tend to react to the political and social pressures\nthey experienced. He applied his theory to various events in the ancient past, like the Trojan\nWar, as well as those of Greece's recent past. Most importantly, Herodotus traveled and read\nsources to serve as the basis of his conclusions. He did not simply sit in his home city and\ntheorize about things; he gathered a huge amount of information about foreign lands and\ncultures and he examined contemporary accounts of events. This use of primary sources is still\nthe defining characteristic of history as an academic discipline: professional historians must\nseek out writings and artifacts from their areas of study and use them as the basis for their own\ninterpretations.\nHerodotus also raised issues of ongoing relevance about the encounter of different\ncultures; despite the greatness of his own civilization, he was genuinely vexed by the issue of\nwhether one set of beliefs and practices (i.e. culture) could be \u201cbetter\u201d than another. He knew\nenough about other cultures, especially Persia, to recognize that other societies could be as\ncomplex, and militarily more powerful, than was Greece. Nevertheless, his history of the\nPersian War continued the age-old Greek practice of referring to the Persians as \u201cbarbarians.\u201d\n115 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe world as described by Herodotus (the map is a contemporary image based on Herodotus\u2019s\nwork). Note the central position of Greece, just south of the region marked \u201cThracians.\u201d\nThe other great Greek historian of the classical period was the Athenian writer\nThucydides (460 \u2013 404 BCE), sometimes considered the real \u201cfather\u201d of history-writing.\nThucydides wrote a history of the Peloponnesian War that remains the single most significant\naccount of the war to this day. The work meticulously follows the events of the war while\ninvestigating the human motivations and subsequent decisions that caused events. The war\nhad been a terrible tragedy, he wrote, because Athens became so power-hungry that it\nsacrificed its own greatness in the quest for more power and wealth. Thus, he deliberately\ncrafted an argument (a thesis) and defended it with historical evidence, precisely the same thing\nhistorians and history students alike are expected to do in their written work. Thanks in part to\nthe work of Herodotus and Thucydides, history became such an important discipline to the\nGreeks that they believed that Clio, one of the divine muses, the sources of inspiration for\nthought and artistic creation, was the patron of history specifically.\n116 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nPhilosophy\nPerhaps the single greatest achievement of Greek thought was in philosophy. It was in\nphilosophy that the Greeks most radically broke with supernatural explanations for life and\nthought and instead sought to establish moral and ethical codes, investigate political theory, and\nunderstand human motivations all in terms of the human mind and human capacities. As noted\nabove, the word \"philosophy\" literally means \"love of knowledge,\" and Greek philosophers did\nmuch more than just contemplate the meaning of life; they were often mathematicians,\nphysicists, and literary critics as well as \"philosophers\" in the sense that that the word is used in\nthe present.\nAmong the important questions that most Greek philosophers dealt with were those\nconcerning politics and ethics. The key question that arose among the early Greek\nphilosophers was whether standards of ethics and political institutions as they existed in Greece\n- including everything from the polis, democracy, tyranny, Greek standards of behavior, and so\non - were somehow dictated by nature or were instead merely social customs that had arisen\nover time. The Classical Age saw the full flowering of Greek engagement with those questions.\nSome of the early philosophers of the Greek classical age were the Sophists: traveling\nteachers who tutored students on all aspects of thought. While they did not represented a truly\nunified body of thought, the one common sophistic doctrine was that all human beliefs and\ncustoms were just habits of a society, that there were no absolute truths, and that it was thus\nvitally important for an educated man to be able to argue both sides of an issue with equal skill\nand rhetorical ability. Their focus was on training elite Greeks to be successful \u2013 the Greek term\nfor \u201cvirtue\u201d was synonymous with \u201csuccess.\u201d Thus, the sophists were in the business of\neducating Greeks to be more successful, especially in the law courts and the public assemblies.\nThey did not have a shared philosophical doctrine besides this idea that truth was relative and\nthat the focus in life ought to be on individual achievement.\nThe men who became the most famous Greek philosophers of all time strongly\ndisagreed with this view. These were a three-person line of teachers and students. Socrates\n(469 \u2013 399 BCE) taught Plato (428 \u2013 347 BCE), who taught Aristotle (384 \u2013 322 BCE), who\nwent on to be the personal tutor of Alexander the Great for a time. It is one of the most\nremarkable intellectual lineages in history - three of the greatest thinkers of Greek civilization\nand one of the greatest military and political leaders, all linked together as teachers and\nstudents.\n117 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nSocrates never wrote anything down; like most of his contemporaries, he believed that\nwriting destroyed the memory and undermined meaning, preferring spoken discourses and\nmemorization. Instead, his beliefs and arguments were recorded by his student Plato, who\ncommitted them to prose despite sharing Socrates\u2019 disdain for the written word. Socrates\nchallenged the sophists and insisted that there are essential truths about morality and ethical\nconduct, but that to arrive at those truths one must be willing to relentlessly question oneself.\nHe took issue with the fact that the sophists were largely unconcerned with ethical behavior,\nfocusing entirely on worldly success; according to Socrates, there were higher truths and\nmeanings to human conduct than mere wealth and political power.\nSocrates used what later became known as the \u201cSocratic Method\u201d to seek out these\nfixed, unchanging rules of truth and ethics. In the Socratic Method, the teacher asks a series of\nquestions of the student, forcing the student to examine her own biases and gaps in logic, until\nfinally arriving at a more satisfying and reasonable belief than she started with. In Socrates's\ncase, his questions were meant to lead his interlocutors to arrive at real, stable truths about\njustice, truth, and virtuous politics. Unlike with the sophists' mastery of rhetoric, the point of the\nquestion-and-answer sessions was not to prove that nothing was true, but instead to force one\nto arrive at truths through the most rigorous application of human reason.\nA Roman copy of an original Greek bust of Socrates - as with many Greek sculptures, only the\nRoman copy survives. Most Greek statues were made of bronze, and over the centuries almost\nall were melted down for the metal.\n118 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nPlato agreed with his teacher that there are essential truths, but he went further:\nbecause the senses can be deceived and because our insight is imperfect, only through the\nmost serious contemplation and discussion can we arrive at truth. Truth could only be\napprehended with the mind, not with the eye or ear, and it required rigorous discussion and\ncontemplation. To Plato, ideas (which he called \"Forms\") were more \"real\" than actual objects.\nThe idea of a table, for instance, is fixed, permanent, and invulnerable, while \"real\" tables are\nfragile, flawed, and impermanent. Plato claimed that politics and ethics were like this as well,\nwith the Form of Justice superseding \"real\" laws and courts, but existing in the intellectual realm\nas something philosophers ought to contemplate.\nIn Plato's work The Republic he wrote of an imaginary polis in which political leaders\nwere raised from childhood to become \"philosopher-kings,\" combining practical knowledge with\na deep understanding of intellectual concepts. Plato believed that the education of a future\nleader was of paramount importance, perhaps even more important than that leader's skill in\nleading armies. Of all his ideas, this concept of a philosopher-king was one of the most\ninfluential; various kings, emperors, and generals influenced by Greek philosophy would try to\nmodel their rule on Plato's concepts right up to the modern era.\nPlato founded a school, the Academy, in Athens, which remained in existence until the\nearly Middle Ages as one of the greatest centers of thought in the world. Philosophers would\ntravel from across the Greek world to learn and debate at the Academy, and it was a mark of\ntremendous intellectual prestige to study there. It prospered through the entire period of\nClassical Greece, the Hellenistic Age that followed, and the Roman Empire, only to be\ndisbanded by the Byzantine (eastern Roman) emperor Justinian in the sixth century CE. It was,\nin short, both one of the most significant and one of the longest-lasting schools in history.\nPlato's most gifted student was Aristotle, who founded his own institution of learning, the\nLyceum, after he was passed over to lead the Academy following Plato's death. Aristotle broke\nsharply with his teacher over the essential doctrine of his teaching. Aristotle argued that the\nsenses, while imperfect, are still reliable enough to provide genuine insights into the workings of\nthe world, and furthermore that the duty of the philosopher was to try to understand the world in\nas great detail as possible. One of his major areas of focus was an analysis of the real-life\npolitics of the polis; his conclusion was that humans are \u201cpolitical animals\u201d and that it was\npossible to improve politics through human understanding and invention, not just contemplation.\nAristotle was the ancient world's greatest intellectual overachiever. He single-handedly\nfounded the disciplines of biology, literary criticism, political science, and logical philosophy. He\n119 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nwrote about everything from physics to astronomy and from mathematics to drama. His work\nwas so influential that philosophers continued to believe in the essential validity of his findings\nwell into the period of the Renaissance (thousands of years later) even though many of his\nscientific conclusions turned out to be factually inaccurate. Despite those inaccuracies, he\nunquestionably deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest thinkers of all time.\nArt\nThe great legacy of Greek art is in its celebration of perfection and balance: the human\nbody in its perfect state, perfect symmetry in buildings, and balance in geometric forms. One\nwell known instance of this was in architecture, with the use of a mathematical concept known\nas the \u201cgolden ratio\u201d (also known as the \u201cgolden mean\u201d) which, when applied to building, creates\nforms that the Greeks, and many others afterwards, believed was inherently pleasing to the eye.\nThe most prominent surviving piece of Greek architecture, the Parthenon of Athens dedicated to\nthe polis\u2019s patron goddess Athena, was built to embody the golden ratio in terms of its height\nand width. Likewise, in its use of symmetrical columns and beautiful carvings, it is widely\nbelieved to strike a perfect balance between elegance and grandeur.\nContemporary view of the Parthenon.\n120 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nIn turn, Greek sculpture is renowned for its unflinching commitment to perfection in the\nhuman form. The classical period saw a transition away from symbolic statuary, most of which\nwas used in grave decorations in the Archaic period, toward lifelike depictions of real human\nbeings. In turn, classical statues often celebrated the human potential for beauty, most\nprominently in nude sculptures of male warriors and athletes at the height of physical strength\nand development. Greek sculptors would often use several live models for their inspiration,\ncombining the most attractive features of each subject to create the \u201cperfected\u201d version present\nin the finished sculpture - this was artistic humanism in its purest form.\nOne of the few original Greek bronze statues to survive, depicting either Zeus or Poseidon\n(Zeus would have held a lightning bolt, Poseidon a trident).\n121 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nMost Greek art was destroyed over time, not least because the dominant medium for\nsculpture was bronze, which had allowed sculptors great flexibility in crafting their work. As\nGreece fell under the domination of other civilizations and empires in the centuries that followed,\nalmost all of those bronzes were melted down for their metal. Fortunately, the Romans so\nappreciated Greek art that they frequently made marble copies of Greek originals. We thus\nhave a fair number of examples of what Greek sculpture looked like, albeit in the form of the\nRoman facsimiles. Likewise, the Romans copied the Greek architectural style and, along with\nthe Greek buildings like the Parthenon that did survive, we are still able to appreciate the Greek\narchitectural aesthetic.\nExploration\nGreek knowledge of the outside world was heavily based on hearsay; Greeks loved\nfantastical stories about lands beyond their immediate knowledge, and so even great historians\nlike Herodotus reported that India was populated by magical beasts and by men with multiple\nheads. In turn, the immediate knowledge Greeks actually had of the world extended to the\ncoasts of the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, Egypt, and Persia, since those were the areas they\nhad colonized or were in contact with through trade. Through the Classical Age, a strong naval\ngarrison was maintained by the Carthaginians, Phoenician naval rivals of the Greeks, at the\nstraits of Gibraltar (the narrow gap between North Africa and southern Spain between the\nMediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean), which prevented Greek sailors from reaching the\nAtlantic and thereby limiting their direct knowledge of the world beyond.\nOne exception to these limited horizons was a Greek explorer named Pytheas. A sailor\nfrom the small Greek polis Massalia that was well-known for producing ship captains and\nnavigators, Pytheas undertook one of the most improbable voyages in ancient history, alongside\nthe famous (albeit anonymous) Phoenician voyage around Africa earlier. Greek sailors already\nknew the world was round and had devised a system for determining latitude that was\nsurprisingly accurate; Pytheas\u2019 own calculation of the latitude of Massalia was only off by eight\nmiles. Driven by a sense of how large the world must be, he set off to sail past the Carthaginian\nsentries and reach the ocean beyond.\nSometime around 330 BCE, roughly the same time Alexander the Great was heading off\nto conquer the Persian Empire, Pytheas evaded the Carthaginian blockade and sailed into\nAtlantic waters. He went on to sail up the coast of France, trading with and noting the cultures\nof the people he encountered. He then sailed across the English Channel, ultimately\n122 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ncircumnavigating England and Scotland, then sailing east to (probably) Denmark, and ultimately\nreturning home to Massalia. He subsequently wrote a book about his account titled On the\nOcean that was met with scorn from most of its Greek audience since it did not have any\nfantastical creatures and mixed in genuine empirical observation (about distances and\nconditions along the way) with its narrative. Armchair critics claimed that it was impossible that\nhe had gone as far north as he said, because north of Greece it was quite cold enough and\nthere was no way humans could live any farther north than that. Practically speaking, despite\nPytheas\u2019s voyage, the Greek world would remain defined by the shores of the Mediterranean.\nConclusion\n\"Classical Greece\" is important historically because of what people thought as much as\nwhat they did. What the Greeks of the Classical Age deserve credit for is an intellectual culture\nthat resulted in remarkable innovations: humanistic art, literature, and a new focus on the\nrational mind's ability to learn about nature and to improve politics and social organization. What\nthe Greeks had never done, however, was spread that culture and those beliefs to non-Greeks,\nboth because of the Greek belief in their own superiority, their adherence to occupying areas\nclose to the sea, and their relative weakness in the face of great empires like Persia. That\nwould change with the rise of a dynasty from the most northern part of Greece itself:\nMacedonia, and its king: Alexander.\nImage Citations (Wikimedia Commons):\nSymposium - Marie-Lan Nguyen\nTheater - Carole Raddato\nHerodotus map - Bibi Saint-Pol\nSocrates - Eric Gaba\nParthenon - Harrieta171\nStatue - Usuario Barcex\nQuote:\nDemosthenes: Victor Bers, Demosthenes, Speeches 50\u201359, University of Texas Press (2003)\n123 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nChapter 7: The Hellenistic Age\nIntroduction\nThe ancient Greek word for Greece is Hellas. The period after the Classical Age is\nreferred to as the Hellenistic Age because it saw Greek civilization spread across the entire\nMiddle East, thanks to the tactical genius and driving ambition of one man, Alexander the Great.\nHellenistic history at its simplest is easy to summarize: a Macedonian king named Alexander\nconquered all of the lands of the Persian Empire during twelve years of almost non-stop\ncampaigning. Shortly afterward, he died without naming an heir. His top generals fell to\nbickering and ultimately carved up Alexander's empire between themselves, founding several\nnew dynasties in the process. Those dynasties would war and trade with each other for about\nthree hundred years before being conquered by the Romans (the rise of Rome happened\nagainst the backdrop of the Hellenistic kingdoms). Thanks to the legacy of Alexander\u2019s\nconquests, Greek culture went from relative insignificance to become a major influence on the\nentire region.\nMacedon and Philip II\nThe story starts in Macedon, a kingdom to the north of Greece. The Macedonians were\nwarriors and traders. They lived in villages instead of poleis and, while they were recognized as\nGreeks because of their language and culture, they were also thought of as being a bit like\ncountry bumpkins by the more \u201ccivilized\u201d Greeks of the south. Macedon was a kingdom ruled by\na single monarch, but that monarch had to constantly deal with both his conniving relatives and\nhis disloyal nobles, all of whom frequently conspired to get more power for themselves.\nMacedon was also bordered by nomadic peoples to the north, particularly the Thracians (from\npresent-day Bulgaria), whose repeated invasions the Macedonians repelled. The Macedonian\narmy was comprised of free citizens who demanded payment after every campaign, payment\nthat could only be secured by looting from defeated enemies. In short, Macedon bred some of\nthe toughest and most wily fighters and political operators in Greece out of sheer necessity.\nBy the fifth century BCE, some of the larger villages of Macedon grew big enough to be\nconsidered cities, and elite Macedonians made efforts to civilize their country in the style of the\nsouthern Greeks. They competed in the Olympics and patronized the arts and literature. They\ntended to stay out of the political affairs of the other Greeks, however; they did not invade the\n124 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nGreek peninsula itself in their constant wars, nor did they take sides in conflicts like the\nPeloponnesian War. This did nothing to improve the situation in Macedon itself, of course, which\nremained split between the royal family and the nobility. In 399 BCE, Macedon slid into an\nongoing civil war, with the nobles openly rejecting the authority of the king and the country\nsliding into anarchy. The war lasted for forty years.\nIn 359 BCE, the Macedonian king, Philip II, re-unified the country. Philip was the classic\nMacedonian leader: shrewd, clever, skilled in battle, and quick to reward loyalty or punish\nsedition. He led military campaigns across Macedonia and the surrounding areas to the north,\ndefeating and usually killing his noble rivals as well as hostile tribes. When men joined with him,\nhe rewarded them with looted wealth, and his army grew.\nPhilip was a tactical innovator as well. He found a way to secure the loyalty of his nobles\nby organizing them into elite cavalry units who swore loyalty to him, and he proudly led his\ntroops personally into battle. He also reorganized the infantry into a new kind of phalanx that\nused longer spears than did traditional hoplites; these new spearmen would hold the enemy in\nplace and then the cavalry would charge them, a tactic that proved effective against both\n\u201cbarbarian\u201d tribes and traditional Greek phalanxes. Philip was the first Macedonian king to insist\non the drilling and training of his infantry, and the combination of his updated phalanx and the\ncavalry proved unstoppable. Philip attacked neighboring Greek settlements and seized gold\nmines in the north of Greece, which funded his soldiers\u2019 pay and equipment. He hired\nmercenaries to supplement his Macedonian troops, ending up with the largest army Macedon\nhad ever seen.\n125 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe expansion of Macedon under Philip II, from the small region marked in the red border to the\nlarger blue region, along with the dependent regions surrounding it.\nThe Greek poleis were understandably worried about these developments. Under the\nleadership of Athens, they organized into a defensive league to resist Macedonian aggression.\nFor about ten years, the Macedonians bribed potential Greek allies, threatened those that\nopposed them, and launched attacks in northern Greece while the larger poleis to the south\nprepared for war. In 338 BCE, following a full-scale Macedonian invasion, the Macedonian army\ncrushed the coalition armies. The key point of the battle was when Philip's eighteen-year-old\nson Alexander led the noble cavalry unit in a charge that smashed the Greek forces.\nIn the aftermath of the invasion, Philip set up a new league of Greek cities under his\ncontrol and stationed troops throughout Greece. As of 338 BCE, Greece was no longer the\ncollection of independent city-states it had been for over a thousand years; it was now united\nunder an invader from the north. The Greeks deeply resented this occupation. They only\n126 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ngrudgingly accepted the Macedonians as fellow Greeks and had celebrated the independence\nof the Greek poleis as one of the defining characteristics of Greek civilization for centuries.\nPhilip thus had his job cut out for him in managing his new conquest.\nThe more immediate problem facing Philip in the aftermath of the Greek conquest was\nthat his men demanded more loot \u2013 the only way he could pay them was to find new places to\ninvade and sack. Thus, Philip ruled Greece but he could not afford to sit idle with troops aching\nfor more victories. Cleverly, having just defeated the Greek poleis, Philip began behaving like a\nGreek statesman and assuming a kind of symbolic leadership role for Greek culture itself, not\njust Greek politics. He began agitating for a Greek invasion of Persia under his leadership to\n\u201cavenge\u201d the Persian invasion of the prior century. All things considered, this was a far-fetched\nscheme; Persia was by far the \u201csuperpower\u201d of its day, and since the end of the Persian War\nover a century earlier numerous Greeks had served Persian kings as mercenaries and\nmerchants. Nevertheless, the idea of an invasion created an excuse for Macedonian and Greek\nimperialism and aggression under cultural pretext of revenge.\nUnfortunately for Philip, he was murdered by one of his bodyguards in 336 BCE, just two\nyears after conquering Greece. Family politics might have been to blame here, as his estranged\nwife Olympias (mother of Alexander) may have ordered his murder, as well as the murder of his\nother wife and children. It is worth noting, however, that the theory of Olympias\u2019 involvement in\nPhilip\u2019s murder was once accepted as fact but has faced sustained criticism for many years.\nRegardless of who was ultimately responsible for the assassination, Alexander ascended to the\nthrone at the age of twenty following his father\u2019s demise, and he remained devoted to his\nmother for as long as she lived.\nAlexander the Great\nAlexander was one of the historical figures who truly deserves the honorific \u201cthe Great.\u201d\nHe was a military genius and a courageous warrior, personally leading his armies in battle and\ncontinuing to fight despite being wounded on several occasions. He was a charismatic and\ninspirational leader who won the loyalty not only of his Macedonian countrymen, but the Greeks\nand, most remarkably, the people of the Persian Empire whom he conquered. He was also\ndriven by incredible ambition; tutored by none other than Aristotle in his youth, he modeled\nhimself on the legendary Greek hero Achilles, hoping to not only match but to surpass Achilles'\nprowess in battle. He became a legend in his own life, worshiped as a god by many of his\nsubjects, and even his Greek subjects came to venerate him as one of the greatest leaders of\nall time.\n127 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nAlexander's conquests began almost immediately after seizing the throne. He first\nruthlessly killed off his rivals and enemies in Macedon and Greece, executing nobles he\nsuspected of treason, and then leading an army back through Macedon, crushing the Thracian\ntribes of the north who threatened to defect. Some of the Greek poleis rose up, hoping to end\nMacedonian control almost as soon as it had begun, but Alexander returned to reconquer the\nrebellious Greek cities. In the case of the city of Thebes, for instance, Alexander let the Thebans\nknow that, by rebelling, they had signed their own death warrants and he refused to accept their\nsurrender, sacking the city and slaughtering thousands of its inhabitants as a warning to the rest\nof Greece.\nBy 334 BCE, two years after he became king, Alexander was thoroughly in control of\nGreece. He immediately embarked on his father's mission to attack Persia, leading a relatively\nsmall army (of about 45,000 men) into Persian territory - note how much smaller this army was\nthan the Persian one had been a century earlier, when Xerxes I had invaded with over 200,000\nsoldiers. He immediately engaged Persian forces and started winning battles, securing Anatolia\nand the rich Greek port cities in 333 BCE and Syria in 332 BCE. In almost every major battle,\nAlexander personally led the cavalry, a quality that inspired loyalty and confidence in his men.\nA Roman mosaic depicting Alexander the Great in battle, possibly based on a Greek original.\n128 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nHis success against the Persians can be explained in part by the fact that the Persian\ntechnique of calling up their armies was too slow. Even though Alexander had arrived in\nAnatolia with only 45,000 men, against a potential Persian army of close to 300,000, far fewer\ntroops were actually available to the Persians at any one time during the first years of\nAlexander\u2019s campaign. Instead, the first two years of the invasion consisted of Macedonian and\nGreek forces engaging with smaller Persian armies, some of which even included Greek\nmercenaries. Alexander\u2019s forces succeeded in conquering Persian territory piecemeal, taking\nkey fortresses and cities, seizing supplies, and fighting off Persian counterattacks. Even with its\noverall military superiority, the Persian Empire could not focus its full might against the Greeks\nuntil much of the western empire had already been lost. In addition, Alexander was happy to\noffer alliances and concessions to Persian subjects who surrendered, sometimes even honoring\nwith lands and positions those who had fought against him and lost honorably. In sum,\nconquest by Alexander was not experienced as a disaster for most Persian subjects, merely a\nshift in rulership.\nIn 332 BCE, the Persian king, Darius III, tried to make peace with Alexander and\n(supposedly - there is reason to believe that this episode was invented by Greek propagandists\nafterwards) offered him his daughter in marriage, along with the entire western half of the\nPersian Empire. Alexander refused and marched into Egypt, where he was welcomed as a\ndivine figure and liberator. Alexander made a point of visiting the key Egyptian temples and\npaying his respects to the Egyptian gods (he identified the chief Egyptian deity Amun-Ra with\nZeus, father of the Greek gods), which certainly eased his acceptance by the Egyptians. In the\nmeantime, Darius III succeeded in raising the entire strength of the Persian army, knowing that a\nfinal showdown was inevitable.\nFrom Egypt, the Greek armies headed east, defeating the Persians at two more major\nbattles, culminating in 330 BCE when they seized Persepolis, the Persian capital city. There, the\nGreek armies looted the entire palace complex before burning it to the ground; historians have\nconcluded that Alexander ordered the burning to force the remaining Persians who were\nresistant to his conquest to acknowledge its finality. The wealth of Persepolis and the\nsurrounding Persian cities paid for the entire Greek army for years to come and inspired a\nrenaissance of building back in Greece and Macedon, paid for with Persian gold. Darius III fled\nto the east but was murdered by Persian nobles, who hoped to hold on to their own\nindependence (this did not work - Alexander painstakingly hunted down the assassins over the\nnext few years).\n129 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nAlexander After the Conquest of Persia\nAlexander paused his campaign to pay off his men and allow some of his troops to\nreturn to Greece. He then arranged for thousands of his Greek and Macedonian officers to\nmarry Persian noblewomen in an effort to formally and permanently fuse together the Greek and\nPersian civilizations. His goal was not to devastate the empire, but to become the next \u201cGreat\nKing\u201d to whom all other leaders had to defer. He maintained the Persian bureaucracy (such as\nthe organization of the Satrapies) and enlisted thousands of Persian soldiers who joined his\ncampaign as his armies moved even farther east. He also made a show of treating Darius's\nfamily with respect and honor, demonstrating that he wanted to win the Persians over rather\nthan humiliate them. Alexander declared that the ancient city of Babylon would be his new\ncapital. Even though he now ruled over the largest empire in the world, however, he was\nunsatisfied, and he set off to conquer lands his new Persian subjects told him about beyond the\nborders of the empire.\nAlexander headed east again with his armies, defeating the tribesmen of present-day\nAfghanistan and then fighting a huge battle against the forces of the Indian king Porus in the\nnorthern Indus River Valley in 327 BCE (Alexander was so impressed by Porus that after the\nbattle he appointed him satrap of what had been Porus\u2019s kingdom). He pressed on into India for\nseveral months, following the Indus south, but finally his loyal but exhausted troops refused to\ngo on. Alexander had heard of Indian kingdoms even farther east (i.e. toward the Ganges River\nValley, completely unknown to the Greeks before this point) and, being Alexander, he wanted to\nconquer them too. His men, however, were both weary and rich beyond their wildest dreams.\nFew of them could see the point of further conquests and wanted instead to return home and\nenjoy their hard-won loot. Some of his followers were now over 65 years old, having fought for\nboth Philip II and then Alexander, and they concluded that it was high time to go home.\nAlexander consulted an oracle that confirmed that disaster would strike if he crossed the\nnext river, so after sulking in his tent for a week, he finally relented. To avoid the appearance of\na retreat, however, he insisted that his armies fight their way down the Indus river valley and\nthen across the southern part of the former Persian Empire on their way back to Mesopotamia.\nUnfortunately, Alexander made a major tactical error when he reached the Indian Ocean,\nsplitting his forces into a fleet and a land force that would travel west separately. The fleet\nsurvived unscathed, but the army had to cross the brutally difficult Makran desert (in the\nsouthern part of present-day Pakistan and Iran), which cost Alexander\u2019s forces more lives than\nhad the entire Indian campaign.\n130 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nAlexander\u2019s conquests - the dark black lines trace his route from Macedon in the far northwest\nthrough Egypt, across the Persian heartland, then to Afghanistan and India, and finally along the\nshores of the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf back to Babylon.\nThe return journey was arduous, and it took years to get back to the heartland of Persia.\nIn 323 BCE, his armies finally arrived in Babylon. Alexander was exhausted and plagued by\ninjuries from the many battles he had fought, but Macedonian and Greek tradition required him\nto drink to excess with his generals. Some combination of his injuries, alcohol, and exhaustion\nfinally caught up with him. Supposedly, while he lay on his deathbed, his generals asked who\nwould follow him as Great King and he replied \u201cthe strongest,\u201d then died. The results were\npredictable: decades of fighting as each general tried to take over the huge empire Alexander\nhad forged.\nThe true legacy of Hellenistic civilization was not Alexander's wars, as remarkable as\nthey were, but their aftermath. During his campaigns, Alexander founded numerous new cities\nthat were to be colonies for his victorious Greek soldiers, all of which were named Alexandria\nexcept for ones that he named after his horse, Bucephalus, and his dog, Peritas. For almost 100\nyears, Greeks and Macedonians streamed to these colonies, which resulted in a tremendous\n131 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ngrowth of Greek culture across the entire ancient world. They also came to settle in conquered\nPersian cities. Everywhere, Greeks became a new elite class, establishing Greek laws and\nGreek buildings and amenities. At the same time, the Greeks were always a small minority in\nthe lands of the east, a fact that Alexander had certainly recognized. To deal with the situation,\nnot only did he encourage inter-marriage, but he simply took over the Persian system of\ngovernance, with its royal road, its regional governors, and its huge and elaborate bureaucracy.\nThe Hellenistic Monarchies\nThe Macedonians could be united by powerful leaders, but their nobility tended to be\nselfish and jealous of power. Since he named no heir, Alexander almost guaranteed that his\nempire would collapse as his generals turned on each other. Indeed, within a year of his death\nthe empire plunged into civil war, and it took until 280 BCE for the fighting to cease and three\nmajor kingdoms to be established, founded by the generals Antigonus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus.\nThe major Hellenistic kingdoms (here Anglicized as \u201cSeleukos\u201d rather than \u201cSeleucid\u201d and\n\u201cPtolemaios\u201d instead of \u201cPtolemaic.\u201d) The Mauryan Empire was a loose confederacy of Indian\nprinces that swiftly achieved independence from Greek influence following Alexander\u2019s death.\nThe Antigonids ruled over Macedon and Greece. Despite controlling the Macedonian\nheartland and Greece itself, the Antigonids possessed the least territory among the Hellenistic\nmonarchies. Macedon and Greece were depopulated by the wars as many thousands of\nsoldiers and their families emigrated to the new military colonies established by Alexander. Over\ntime, the Antigonids had to fight to hold on to power in Greece and they ultimately saw many of\n132 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthe Greek poleis achieve independence from their rule. That noted, their hold over Macedon\nremained strong until its conquest by Rome in 148 BCE.\nThe Ptolemies ruled over Egypt. The Ptolemies were very powerful and, perhaps more\nimportantly, they had the benefit of ruling over a coherent, unified state that had ancient\ntraditions of kingship. Once they cemented their control, the Ptolemies were able to simply act\nas pharaohs, despite remaining ethnically and linguistically Macedonian Greek. In their state,\nthe top levels of rule and administration were Greek, but the bulk of the royal bureaucracy was\nEgyptian. There were long-term patterns of settlement and integration, but right up to the end\nthe dynasty itself was fiercely proud of its Greek heritage, with Greek soldier colonies providing\nthe backbone of the Ptolemaic military. Ptolemy had been a close friend and trusted general of\nAlexander, and he took Alexander\u2019s body to Egypt and buried it in a magnificent tomb in\nAlexandria, thereby asserting a direct connection between his regime and Alexander himself.\nUnder Ptolemaic rule, Alexandria also became a gathering place for scholars and intellectuals of\nall kinds. In the end, the Ptolemies were the longest-lasting of the Hellenistic dynasties.\nOne of the most important artifacts of the Ptolemaic era: the Rosetta Stone, the object that\nenabled the translation of Egyptian hieroglyphics. Written during Ptolemaic rule, the stone\nconsists of a single royal proclamation in two hieroglyphic alphabets as well as ancient Greek.\n133 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Seleucids ruled over Mesopotamia and Persia. Despite the vast wealth of the\nSeleucid kingdom, it was the most difficult one to govern effectively. There was a relative\nscarcity of Greeks vis-\u00e0-vis the native populations, and it was thus also the most diverse. It\nproved impossible in the long term for the Seleucid kings to hold on to the entire expanse of\nterritories originally conquered by Alexander. After a military defeat, Seleucus himself gave his\nIndian territory back to an Indian king, Chandragupta, in 301 BCE in return for some elephants;\nChandragupta would go on to found one of India\u2019s most impressive ancient states, the Mauryan\nEmpire. Back in Persia, in 247 BCE a former Seleucid general based in the region of Parthia\ndestroyed Seleucid control in the Iranian Plateau, in the process founding a new Persian empire\n(remembered as the Parthian Empire for the region its rulers originally governed). Nevertheless,\nthe Seleucid kingdom held on until its remnants were defeated in 63 BCE by Pompey the Great\nof Rome, one-time ally and subsequent enemy of Julius Caesar.\nEach of the successor kingdoms was ruled by Greeks and Macedonians, and a complex\nrelationship emerged between the cultures and languages of the kingdoms. Greek remained the\nlanguage of state and the language of the elites, the Persian trade language of Aramaic was still\nused across most of the lands, and then a host of local tongues existed as the vernacular. The\nkings often did not speak a word of the local languages; as an example, Cleopatra VII (the\nfamous Cleopatra and last ruler of Egypt before its conquest by Rome) was the first Ptolemaic\nmonarch to speak Egyptian.\nAll of the Hellenistic monarchs tried to rule in the style of Alexander, rewarding their inner\ncircles with riches, founding new cities, and expanding trade routes to foreign lands. They also\nwarred with one another, however, with the Ptolemies and the Seleucids emerging as\nparticularly bitter rivals, frequently fighting over the territories that divided their empires (e.g.\nthey fought eight full-scale wars over Canaan in total). The kingdoms fielded large armies, many\nof which consisted of the descendants of Greek settlers who agreed to serve in the armies in\nreturn for permanent land-holdings in special military towns.\nThe Ptolemaic kingdom is particularly noteworthy: starting with Ptolemy himself, the\nexisting Egyptian bureaucracy was expanded and its middle and upper ranks staffed entirely by\nGreeks (and Macedonians), who developed obsessively detailed records on every sheaf of\nwheat owed to the royal treasury. So much papyrus was used in keeping records that old copies\nhad to be dumped unceremoniously in holes in the desert to make room for new ones - quite a\nlot of information about the Ptolemaic economy survived in these dumps to be discovered by\narchaeologists a few thousand years later. Likewise, the abundance of the Nile was carefully\nmanaged to produce the greatest yields in history, so large that even after numerous taxes were\n134 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ntaken, Egyptian wheat was still the cheapest available everywhere from Spain to Mesopotamia\n(the same held true with papyrus, a royal monopoly used everywhere in the Hellenistic world).\nUnder the Ptolemies, Egypt was in many ways at its most prosperous in history, outstripping\neven the incredible bounty of the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms centuries earlier.\nThe political legacy of the Seleucid kingdom was of nearly constant rebellion and\ninfighting. While the dynasty tried to model itself both on Greek traditions of rule and on the\nearlier Persian dynasty of the Achaemenids (Darius III was the last of that dynasty to rule), it\nnever established legitimacy in the eyes of many of its subjects. Instead, the Seleucid rulers\nwere military leaders first and foremost, often obliged to criss-cross their large empire\nsuppressing rebellions, fighting off invasions of Central Asian nomads, and squabbling with their\nneighbors in Egypt.\nThat noted, where Seleucid rule left a lasting mark on the region it was in consolidating\nlong-distance trade. The Silk Road that linked China, India, the Middle East, and Europe truly\nbegan during the Hellenistic period and the Seleucids did everything in their power to support\ntrade in their territories. They supervised the construction of roads and canals useful to\nmerchants and derived much of their revenue from silk textiles. Even though raw silk (from\nsilkworms) was only available from China, subjects of the Seleucids in Mesopotamia did master\nthe production of textiles from the raw material, creating an enormously valuable commodity to\nmarkets farther west. Thus, even though Seleucid political control was somewhat haphazard\noverall, it did at least play a role in encouraging the east/west trade that would only grow in the\nfollowing centuries.\nCulture and Gender\nOne of the remarkable aspects of the Hellenistic age was the extent to which the people\nof Greece and the Middle East started exploring beyond the confines of the ancient world as\nthey had known it. The Ptolemies supported trading posts along the Red Sea and as far south\nas present-day Eritrea and Ethiopia, trading for ivory and gold from the African interior.\nExplorers tried to circumnavigate Africa itself, but did not quite succeed. In addition to accounts\nby explorers, the Greeks of the Hellenistic lands enjoyed histories and accounts of foreign lands\nwritten by the natives of those lands. Major histories of Mesopotamia, Persia, and Egypt were\nwritten during the Hellenistic period and translated into Greek. Ambassadors from the Hellenistic\nkingdoms in foreign lands sometimes wrote accounts of the customs of those lands (such as\nIndia). In short, it was a period when knowledge of the world greatly expanded.\n135 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe core of the Hellenistic kingdoms were the new cities founded by Alexander or, later,\nby the Hellenistic monarchs. The largest was Alexandria in Egypt, but there were equivalently\ngrandiose cities in the other kingdoms. Both the new cities founded by Alexander and his\nsuccessors and the old Greek settlements along the eastern coasts of the Mediterranean grew\nand prospered. The new cities were built on grid-pattern streets with various Greek amenities\nlike public forums, theaters, and temples. Likewise, citizenship, which had been the basic unit of\npolitical currency in the ancient poleis, became instead a mark of elite membership that could be\nwon in multiple cities at the same time.\nOf note is the fact that the Seleucid cities represented the first major experiment in what\nwe now call the welfare state. Because of the obligations the first monarchs felt toward their\nspecifically Greek subjects, things like education and garbage collection were funded by the\nstate. Eventually, public services extended to include poor relief, which consisted of free food\ndistributed within the cities to the poorest classes of permanent residents. This practice had\nnothing to do with charity; it was simply a means for keeping the peace in the growing cities.\nThere were major ongoing problems for the Hellenistic ruling class, however, the most\nimportant of which was the continued stratification between Greeks and their non-Greek\nsubjects. Greeks in the Hellenistic kingdoms felt that they were the heirs to Alexander\u2019s\nconquests and that they were thus justified in occupying most, if not all, of the positions of\npolitical power. Especially in places like Egypt and Mesopotamia that had enormous non-Greek\npopulations, resentment could easily turn into outright rebellion. Various works emerged among\nthe subjects of the Hellenistic kingdoms predicting the downfall of their Greek rulers;\nMesopotamian priests, Zoroastrians in Persia, and Egyptian religious leaders all wrote works of\nprophecy claiming that the Greeks were in league with evil forces and would eventually be\ndeposed. The Jews also struggled with their Greek overlords, a problem exacerbated by the fact\nthat they were ruled first by the Ptolemies and then by the Seleucids. While the Ptolemaic\nkingdom remained relatively stable until its takeover by the Romans in 30 BCE, both the\nAntigonid and Seleucid kingdoms lost ground over the years, ultimately ruling over a fraction of\ntheir former territories by the time the Romans began encroaching in the second century BCE.\nUnrelated to the struggle between Greeks and non-Greeks, the Hellenistic period saw a\nsignificant shift in gender relations. Simply put, the Greek obsession with maintaining not just a\nstrict sexual hierarchy but an attempt to separate men and women socially that reached its\nzenith in Classical Athens loosened enormously in the Hellenistic age. Women were praised for\nfulfilling social and familial duties, for carrying out religious ceremonies, and even for their\n136 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\npolitical savvy in the case of noteworthy queens (like Alexander\u2019s mother Olympias or, much\nlater, the famous Cleopatra VII).\nStrikingly, Hellenistic women exercised considerable economic power and enjoyed much\ngreater legal recognition than had women in earlier periods of Greek history. While they were\nsometimes obliged to do so with the backing of a male guardian, women controlled property,\ncould borrow and lend money, and could manage the inheritances of their children. Some few\nwomen even served in political office - for example, a woman served as a magistrate in the polis\nof Histria, on the shores of the Black Sea, in the first century BCE.\nThe general pattern appears to be that women in Greece itself faced greater legal\nrestrictions than those living in Greek colonies elsewhere in the Hellenistic world, which is\nunsurprising since the older Greek poleis had centuries of both law and tradition in place\nenforcing sexual divisions. The Macedonian society represented by Alexander and his\ncompanions had always been less restrictive, with women exercising much more autonomy than\nin the Greek poleis to the south, and that cultural value was clearly imprinted along with\nMacedonian rule itself across the Hellenistic world. Back in Greece, meanwhile, Sparta stood\napart as the one polis that exceeded even Macedonian gender standards: Spartan women were\nfully autonomous economically, owning two-fifths of the land overall, and asserting considerable\npolitical influence.\nAs usual when discussing gender in the pre-modern period, however, it is necessary to\nprovide some caveats about greater periods of freedom and autonomy for women. With very\nfew exceptions (once again, Cleopatra VII is the outstanding example), men continued to control\npolitics. The laws of the Hellenistic kingdoms did protect and recognize women in various ways,\nbut men were always given the greater legal role and identity. Analysis of birth rates suggests\nthat infanticide was common, with girl babies often left to die both out of a general preference\nfor boys and because the dowry the girl would have to be provided for at marriage was a\nburdensome expense for the family. Most male intellectuals continued to insist on the\ndesirability of female submission, and with a few great exceptions, the bulk of the literature and\nphilosophy from the period was written by men.\nPhilosophy and Science\nHellenistic philosophy largely shifted away from the concerns of Greek philosophers of\nthe Classical Age. Because philosophers were discouraged from studying politics, as had\nSocrates, Plato, and Aristotle, they turned instead to investigations of personal ethics, of how to\nlive one's life to be happy, even if a larger kind of social justice remained elusive. All of the major\n137 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nschools of Hellenistic philosophy shared the same pursuit, albeit in different ways: to live in\npleasure and tranquility. Three are of particular note: the Epicureans, Stoics, and Cynics.\nThe Epicureans, named after their founder Epicurus, believed that humans ought to turn\ntheir backs on the pointless drama of politics and social competition and retire to a kind of inner\ncontemplation. Epicurus taught that even if gods existed, they clearly had no interest in human\naffairs and thus did not need to be feared. Death was final and total, representing release and\npeace, not an afterlife of torment or work, so there was no need to worry about it, either. In\nshort, the Epicureans believed in a virtuous renunciation of earthly cares and an indulgence in\npleasure. Pleasure was not about overindulgence, however (which led to suffering - think of\nindigestion and hangovers), but a refined enjoyment of food, drink, music, and sex, although\none interesting aspect of this philosophy was the idea that sexual pleasure was fine, but\nemotional love was to be avoided since it was too likely to result in suffering. To this day, the\nword \u201cepicurean\u201d as it is used in English means someone who enjoys the finer things in life,\nespecially in terms of good cooking!\nThe Cynics believed that social conventions were unfortunate byproducts of history that\ndistracted people from the true source of virtue and happiness: nature. In turn, the only route to\nhappiness was a more aggressive rejection of social life than that espoused by the Epicureans\n(who, again, were quite sedate). They advocated a combination of asceticism and naturalism,\nindulging in one\u2019s physical needs without regard to social convention. Practically speaking, this\ninvolved deliberately flouting social mores, sometimes in confrontational or even disgusting\nways: Diogenes, founder of the Cynics, notoriously masturbated and defecated in public. Most\nCynics were slightly more restrained, but most took great pleasure in mocking people in\npositions of political authority, and they also belittled the members of other philosophical schools\nfor their overly rigid systems of thought. One story had it that Alexander sought out Diogenes\nand found him lying in the street in a suburb of the polis of Corinth, asking him what he, the\nking, might do for him, the philosopher. The Cynic replied \u201cstop standing in my sunbeam.\u201d\nOriginally an offshoot of the Cynics, the Stoics became philosophers of fate and\nrationality. Unlike the Epicureans, Stoics believed that humans had an obligation to engage in\npolitics, which formed part of a great divine plan, something linked to both fate and nature. As\nparticipants in the natural order, humans ought to learn to accept the trials and tribulations of life\nrationally, without succumbing to emotion (hence the contemporary meaning of the word \u201cstoic\u201d:\nsomeone who is indifferent in the face of pain or discomfort). The Stoics accepted the necessity\nof being part of a society and of fulfilling social obligations, but they warned against excesses of\npride and greed. Instead, a Stoic was to do his duty in his social roles without the distraction of\n138 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nluxury or indulgence. They were one possible version of a philosophy that believes in the\nexistence of fate, of accepting one's place in a larger scheme instead of resisting it, and they\nalso celebrated the idea that the rational mind was always more powerful than emotional\nreactions.\nWhat these three schools of philosophy had in common, despite their obvious\ndifferences, is that they all represented different approaches to accepting the (political) status\nquo. The Epicureans avoided politics, the Stoics supported existing political structures, and the\nCynics mocked everything without offering positive suggestions for change. This was a far cry\nfrom the earnest inquiry of a Socrates, a Plato, or an Aristotle in trying to establish a virtuous\nform of politics. While Greek culture enjoyed a period of unprecedented influence during the\nHellenistic period, its experiments in rational (let alone democratic) political analysis were not a\nmajor component of that influence.\nWhile political theory did not enjoy a period of growth during the period, there were\nsignificant accomplishments in science and mathematics. The most important Hellenistic\nmathematicians were Euclid and Archimedes. Euclid was the inventor of the mathematical\ndiscipline of geometry. He was the first to use obvious starting points called axioms \u2013 for\ninstance, the idea that two parallel lines will never intersect \u2013 to be able to deduce more\ncomplex principles called theorems. Euclid is one of those relatively few ancient thinkers who\nreally \u201cgot it right\u201d in the sense that none of his major claims were later proved to be inaccurate.\nHis work on geometry, the Elements, was still used as the standard textbook in many courses\non mathematics well into the twentieth century CE, thousands of years after it was composed.\nArchimedes was also a geometrician, best remembered for his applications of geometry to\nengineering. He discovered the principle of using the displacement of water to calculate the\nspecific gravity of objects, and he devised a number of complex war machines used against\nRoman forces when his home city of Syracuse, in Sicily, was under attack (including, according\nto some accounts, a giant mirror used to focus the sun's rays on Roman ships and set them on\nfire).\nHellenistic thinkers also made important discoveries in astronomy, most notably the fact\nthat the astronomer Aristarchus of Samos posited that the sun was the center of the solar\nsystem. Hellenistic astronomers also refined the calculations associated with the size of the\nEarth; one astronomer named Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth that was\nonly off by 200 miles. Another astronomer named Hipparchus created the first star charts that\nincluded precise positions for stars over the course of the year, and to help keep track of their\npositions he created the first system of longitudes and latitudes.\n139 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nPerhaps the most memorable achievement in scholarship during the period was the\ninstitutional form it took at the Library of Alexandria and its associated Museon, often considered\nto be the first research university in the western world. Funded directly by the Ptolemaic\ngovernment, the Library collected and translated every scrap of available scholarship from the\nHellenistic world and played host to scholars who based their own work on its archives. It\nhoused lecture halls as well, representing the preeminent site of learning in the Hellenistic world\nas a whole. In fact, the Museon functioned similarly to a modern university: scholars resided\nthere, conducted research in a variety of specialized subjects, and presented their findings via\nlecture and publication. Unfortunately, the Museon was eventually destroyed, although to this\nday there are competing versions of who was to blame for its destruction (ranging from the\nforces of Julius Caesar during his involvement in an Egyptian civil war to either Christian or\nMuslim fanatics centuries later).\nThus, there were certainly important intellectual breakthroughs that occurred during the\nHellenistic period. There were not, however, corresponding achievements in technology or\nengineering. That is not surprising; the pace of technological change in the ancient world was\nalways glacially slow by modern standards. Instead, what mattered at the time was the spread\nof ideas and knowledge, much of which had no immediate and practical consequences in the\nform of applied technology - this was as true of ancient Rome as it was of the Hellenistic\nkingdoms.\nConclusion\nWhile Alexander the Great is a well-known figure from ancient history, the Hellenistic\nperiod as a whole is not. The reason for that relative neglect (in popular culture and in many\nhistory surveys, at least those at the pre-college level) is that the Hellenistic age is\novershadowed by what was happening simultaneously to the west: the rise of Rome. In\nprecisely the same period in which Alexander and his successors first conquered then ruled the\nterritories of the former Persian Empire, Rome was in the process of evolving from a town in\ncentral Italy to the center of what would eventually be one of the greatest and longest-lasting\nempires in world history. That is the subject of the next few chapters.\nImage Citations (Wikimedia Commons):\nMacedonian expansion - MaryroseB54\nAlexander mosaic - Unattributed\nAlexander's conquests - George Willis Botsford\nHellenistic kingdoms - Javierfv1212\n140 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nRosetta Stone - Creative Commons License\n141 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nChapter 8: The Roman Republic\nIntroduction\nIn many ways, Rome defines Western Civilization. Even more so than Greece, the\nRoman Republic and the Roman Empire that followed created the idea of a single, united\ncivilization sharing certain attributes and providing a lasting intellectual and political legacy. Its\nboundaries, from what is today England to Turkey and from Germany to Spain, mark out the\nheartland of what its inhabitants would later consider itself to be \u201cThe West\u201d in so many words.\nThe Greek intellectual legacy was eagerly taken up by the Romans and combined with\nunprecedented organization and engineering on a scale the Greeks had never imagined, even\nunder Alexander the Great.\nRoman Origins\nRome was originally a town built amidst seven hills surrounded by swamps in central\nItaly. The Romans were just one group of \u201cLatins,\u201d central Italians who spoke closely-related\ndialects of the Latin language. Rome itself had a few key geographical advantages. Its hills\nwere easily defensible, making it difficult for invaders to carry out a successful attack. It was at\nthe intersection of trade routes, thanks in part to its proximity to a natural ford (a shallow part of\na river that can be crossed on foot) in the Tiber River, leading to a prosperous commercial and\nmercantile sector that provided the wealth for early expansion. It also lay on the route between\nthe Greek colonies of southern Italy and various Italian cultures in the central and northern part\nof the peninsula.\nThe legend that the Romans themselves invented about their own origins had to do with\ntwo brothers: Romulus and Remus. In the legend of Romulus and Remus, two boys were born\nto a Latin king, but then kidnapped and thrown into the Tiber River by the king\u2019s jealous brother.\nThey were discovered by a female wolf and suckled by her, eventually growing up and exacting\ntheir revenge on their treacherous uncle. They then fought each other, with Romulus killing\nRemus and founding the city of Rome. According to the story, the city of Rome was founded on\nApril 21, 753 BCE. This legend is just that: a legend. Its importance is that it speaks to how the\nRomans wanted to see themselves, as the descendants of a great man who seized his birthright\n142 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthrough force and power, accepting no equals. In a sense, the Romans were proud to believe\nthat their ancient heritage involved being literally raised by wolves.\nReplica of an Etruscan-era statue of Romulus and Remus suckling from the wolf.\nThe Romans were a warrior people from very early on, feuding and fighting with their\nneighbors and with raiders from the north. They were allied with and, for a time, ruled by a\nneighboring people called the Etruscans who lived to the northwest of Rome. The Etruscans\nwere active trading partners with the Greek poleis of the south, and Rome became a key link\nalong the Etruscan - Greek trade route. The Etruscans ruled a loose empire of allied city-states\nthat carried on a brisk trade with the Greeks, trading Italian iron for various luxury goods. This\nmixing of cultures, Etruscan, Greek, and Latin, included shared mythologies and stories. The\nGreek gods and myths were shared by the Romans, with only the names of the gods being\nchanged (e.g. Zeus became Jupiter, Aphrodite became Venus, Hades became Pluto, etc.). In\nthis way, the Romans became part of the larger Mediterranean world of which the Greeks were\nsuch a significant part.\nAccording to Roman legends, the Etruscans ruled the Romans from some time in the\neighth century BCE until 509 BCE. During that time, the Etruscans organized them to fight\n143 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nalong Greek lines as a phalanx. From the phalanx, the Romans would eventually create new\nforms of military organization and tactics that would overwhelm the Greeks themselves (albeit\nhundreds of years later). There is no actual evidence that the Etruscans ruled Rome, but as\nwith the legend of Romulus and Remus, the story of early Etruscan rule inspired the Romans to\nthink of themselves in certain ways - most obviously as rejecting foreign rule of any kind, or\neven of foreign cultural influence. Romans were always fiercely proud (to the point of\nbelligerence) of their heritage and identity.\nBy 600 BCE the Romans had drained the swamp in the middle of their territory and built\nthe first of their large public buildings. As noted, they were a monarchy at the time, ruled by\n(possibly) Etruscan kings, but with powerful Romans serving as advisers in an elected senate.\nNative-born men rich enough to afford weapons were allowed to vote, while native-born men\nwho were poor were considered full Romans but had no vote. In 509 BCE (according to their\nown legends), the Romans overthrew the last Etruscan king and established a full Republican\nform of government, with elected senators making all of the important political decisions.\nRoman antipathy to kings was so great that no Roman leader would ever call himself Rex - king\n- even after the Republic was eventually overthrown centuries later.\nNote: The Celts\nWhile the Hellenistic world was flourishing in Greece and the Middle East, and Rome\nwas beginning its long climb from obscurity to power, most of Western Europe was dominated\nby the Celts. The Celts provide background context to the rise of Rome, since Roman\nexpansion would eventually spell the end of Celtic independence in most of Europe.\nMuch less is known about the Celts than about the contemporaneous cultures of the\nMediterranean because the Celts did not leave a written record. The Celts were not a unified\nempire of any kind; they were a tribal people who shared a common culture and a set of beliefs,\nalong with certain technologies having to do with metal-working and agriculture.\nThe Celts were a warrior society which seemed to have practiced a variation of what\nwould later be known as feudal law, in which every offense demanded retribution in the former\nof either violence or \u201cman gold\u201d: the payment needed to atone for a crime and thereby prevent\nthe escalation of violence. The Celts were in contact with the people of the Mediterranean world\nfrom as early as 800 BCE, mostly through trade. They lived in fortified towns and were as quick\nto raid as to trade with their neighbors.\n144 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nWe know relatively little about Celtic culture because they left no first-hand written\naccounts. Celtic legends survive, but they were recorded centuries after the Roman period had\nended, so their relationship to earlier periods of Celtic history is unclear. Some of the accounts\nof the Celts written by Roman authors (including Plutarch, Julius Caesar, and Tacitus) suggest\nthat women may have enjoyed more freedom and political power in Celtic society than in many\nother ancient cultures, with Plutarch describing a panel of Celtic women negotiating with the\nCarthaginian general Hannibal and Tacitus recounting the British Celtic queen Boudicca and her\ndaughters riding to battle against the Romans. In the end, the details of Celtic politics and\nbeliefs remain obscure, however.\nBy about 450 BCE the Celts expanded dramatically across Europe. They seem to have\nbecome more warlike and expansionist and they adopted a number of technologies already in\nuse further south, including chariot warfare and currency. By 400 BCE groups of Celts began to\nraid further into \u201ccivilized\u201d lands, sacking Rome itself in 387 BCE and pushing into the Hellenistic\nlands of Macedonia, Greece, and Anatolia. Subsequently, Celtic raiders tended to settle by\nabout 200 BCE, often forming distinct smaller kingdoms within larger lands, such as the region\ncalled Galatia in Anatolia, and serving as mercenary warriors for the Hellenistic kingdoms.\nEventually, when the Romans began to expand beyond Italy itself, it was the Celts who\nwere first conquered and then assimilated into the Republic. The Romans regarded Celts as\nbarbarians, but they were thought to be barbarians who were at least capable of assimilating\nand adopting \"true\" civilization from the Romans. Centuries later, the descendants of conquered\nCelts considered themselves fully Roman: speaking Latin as their native language, wearing\ntogas, drinking wine, and serving in the Roman armies. In the long run, Celtic culture and\nlanguages survived in areas the Romans either never conquered or did not completely\nassimilate, most obviously in Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.\nThe Republic\nThe Roman Republic had a fairly complex system of government and representation, but\nit was one that would last about 500 years and preside over the vast expansion of Roman\npower. An assembly, called the Centuriate Assembly, was elected by the citizens and created\nlaws. Each year, the assembly elected two executives called consuls to oversee the laws and\nensure their enforcement. The consuls had almost unlimited power, known as imperium,\nincluding the right to inflict the death penalty on law-breakers, and they were preceded\neverywhere by twelve bodyguards called lictors. Consular authority was, however, limited by\n145 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthe fact that the terms were only a year long and each consul was expected to hold the other in\ncheck if necessary. Under the consuls there was the Senate, essentially a large body of\naristocratic administrators, appointed for life, who controlled state finances. The whole system\nwas tied closely to the priesthoods of the Roman gods, who performed divinations and\nblessings on behalf of the city. While the Romans were deeply suspicious of individuals who\nseemed to be trying to take power themselves, several influential families worked behind the\nscenes to ensure that they could control voting blocks in the Centuriate Assembly and the\nSenate.\nWhen Rome faced a major crisis, the Centuriate Assembly could vote to appoint a\ndictator, a single man vested with the full power of imperium. Symbolically, all twenty-four of the\nlictors would accompany the dictator, who was supposed to use his almost-unlimited power to\nsave Rome from whatever threatened it, then step down and return things to normal. While the\noffice of dictator could have easily led to an attempted takeover, for hundreds of years very few\ndictators abused their powers and instead respected the temporary nature of Roman\ndictatorship itself.\nThe rich were referred to as patricians, families with ancient roots in Rome who occupied\nmost of the positions of the senate and the judiciary in the city. There were about one hundred\npatrician families, descending from the men Romulus had, allegedly, appointed to the first\nsenate. They were allied with other rich and powerful people, owners of large tracts of land, in\ntrying to hold in check the plebeians, Roman citizens not from patrician backgrounds.\nWhile the Senate began as an advisory body, it later wrested real law-making power\nfrom the consuls (who were, after all, almost always drawn from its members). By 133 BCE, the\nSenate proposed legislation and could veto the legislation of the consuls. An even more\nimportant power was its ability to designate funds for war and public building, giving it enormous\npower over what the Roman government actually did, since the senate could simply cut off\nfunding to projects it disagreed with.\nThe Centuriate Assembly was divided into five different classes based on wealth (a\nsystem that ensured that the wealthy could always outvote the poorer). The wealthiest class\nconsisted of the equestrians, so named because they could afford horses and thus form the\nRoman cavalry; the equestrian class would go on to be a leading power bloc in Roman history\nwell into the Imperial period. The Centuriate Assembly voted on the consuls each year,\ndeclared war and peace, and acted as a court of appeal in legal cases involving the death\npenalty. It could also propose legislation, but the Senate had to approve it for it to become law.\n146 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nClass Struggle\nRome struggled with a situation analogous to that of Athens, in which the rich not only\nhad a virtual monopoly on political power, but in many cases had the legal right to either enslave\nor at least extract labor from debtors. In Rome's case, an ongoing class struggle called the\nConflict of Orders took place from about 500 BCE to 360 BCE (140 years!), in which the\nplebeians struggled to get more political representation. In 494 BCE, the plebeians threatened\nto simply leave Rome, rendering it almost defenseless, and the Senate responded by allowing\nthe creation of two officials called Tribunes, men drawn from the plebeians who had the legal\npower to veto certain decisions made by the Senate and consuls. Later, the government\ncreated a Plebeian Council to represent the needs of the plebeians, approved the right to marry\nbetween patricians and plebeians, banned debt slavery, and finally, came to the agreement that\nof the two consuls elected each year, one had to be a plebeian. By 287 BCE, the Plebeian\nAssembly could pass legislation with the weight of law as well.\nRoman soldiers were citizen-soldiers, farmers who volunteered to fight for Rome in\nhopes of being rewarded with wealth taken from defeated enemies. An important political\nbreakthrough happened in about 350 BCE when the Romans enacted a law that limited the\namount of land that could be given to a single citizen after a victory, ensuring a more equitable\ndistribution of land to plebeian soldiers. This was a huge incentive to serve in the Roman army,\nsince any soldier now had the potential to become very rich if he participated in a successful\ncampaign against Rome's enemies.\nThat being said, class struggle was always a factor in Roman politics. Even after the\nplebeians gained legal concessions, the rich always held the upper hand because wealthy\nplebeians would regularly join with patricians to out-vote poorer plebeians. Likewise, in the\nCenturiate Assembly, the richer classes had the legal right to out-vote the poorer classes \u2013 the\nequestrians and patricians often worked together against the demands of the poorer classes.\nPractically speaking, by the early third century BCE the plebeians had won meaningful legal\nrights, namely the right to representation and lawmaking, but those victories were often\novershadowed by the fact that wealthy plebeians increasingly joined with the existing patricians\nto create something new: the Roman aristocracy. Most state offices did not pay salaries, so\nonly those with substantial incomes from land (or from loot won in campaigns) could afford to\nserve as full-time representatives, officials, or judges - that, too, fed into the political power of\nthe aristocracy over common citizens.\n147 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nIn the midst of this ongoing struggle, the Romans came up with the basis of Roman law,\nthe system of law that, through various iterations, would become the basis for most systems of\nlaw still in use in Europe today (Britain being a notable exception). Private law governed\ndisputes between individuals (e.g. property suits, disputes between business partners), while\npublic law governed disputes between individuals and the government (e.g. violent crimes that\nwere seen as a threat to the social order as a whole). In addition, the Romans established the\nLaw of Nations to govern the territories it started to conquer in Italy; it was an early form of\ninternational law based on what were believed to be universal standards of justice.\nThe plebeians had been concerned that legal decisions would always favor the\npatricians, who had a monopoly on legal proceedings, so they insisted that the laws be written\ndown and made publicly available. Thus, in 451 BCE, members of the Roman government\nwrote the Twelve Tables, lists of the laws available for everyone to see, which were then posted\nin the Roman Forum in the center of Rome. Just as it was done in Athens a hundred years\nearlier, having the laws publicly available reduced the chances of corruption. In fact, according\nto a Roman legend, the ten men who were charged with recording the laws were sent to Athens\nto study the laws of Solon of Athens; this was a deliberate use or \u201ccopy\u201d of his idea.\nRoman Expansion\nRoman expansion began with its leadership of a confederation of allied cities, the Latin\nLeague. Rome led this coalition against nearby hill tribes that had periodically raided the area,\nthen against the Etruscans that had once ruled Rome itself. Just as the Romans started to\nconsider further territorial expansion, a fierce raiding band of Celts swooped in and sacked\nRome in 389 BCE, a setback that took several decades to recover from. In the aftermath, the\nRomans swore to never let the city fall victim to an attack again.\nA key moment in the early period of Roman expansion was in 338 BCE when Rome\ndefeated its erstwhile allies in the Latin League. Rome did not punish the cities after it defeated\nthem, however. Instead, it offered them citizenship in its republic (albeit without voting rights) in\nreturn for pledges of loyalty and troops during wartime, a very important precedent because it\nmeant that with every victory, Rome could potentially expand its military might. Soon, the elites\nof the Latin cities realized the benefits of playing along with the Romans. They were dealt into\nthe wealth distributed after military victories and could play an active role in politics so long as\nthey remained loyal, whereas resisters were eventually ground down and defeated with only\ntheir pride to show for it. While Rome would rarely extend actual citizenship to whole\n148 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ncommunities in the future, the assimilation of the Latins into the Roman state did set an\nimportant precedent: conquered peoples could be won over to Roman rule and contribute to\nRoman power, a key factor in Rome\u2019s ongoing expansion from that point forward.\nExpansion of the Republic, from the region marked in dark red around Rome itself in Central\nItaly north and south along the Italian Peninsula, culminating in the conquests of Northern Italy,\nSicily, and Sardinia (whose conquests are described in the section below).\nRome rapidly expanded to encompass all of Italy except the southernmost regions.\nThose regions, populated largely by Greeks who had founded colonies there centuries before,\ninvited a Greek warrior-king named Pyrrhus to aid them against the Romans around 280 BCE\n(Pyrrhus was a Hellenistic king who had already wrested control of a good-sized swath of\nGreece from the Antigonid dynasty back in Greece). Pyrrhus won two major battles against the\n149 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nRomans, but in the process he lost two-thirds of his troops. After his victories, he made a\ncomment that \u201cone more such victory will undo me\u201d - this led to the phrase \"pyrrhic victory,\"\nwhich means a temporary victory that ultimately spells defeat, or winning the battle but losing\nthe war. He took his remaining troops and returned to Greece. After he fled, the south was\nunable to mount much of a resistance, and all of Italy was under Roman control by 263 BCE.\nRoman Militarism\nIt is important to emphasize the extreme militarism and terrible brutality of Rome during\nthe republican period, very much including this early phase in which it began to acquire its\nempire. Wars were annual: with very few exceptions over the centuries the Roman legions\nwould march forth to conquer new territory every single year. The Romans swiftly acquired a\nreputation for absolute ruthlessness and even wanton cruelty, raping and/or slaughtering the\ncivilian inhabitants of conquered cities, enslaving thousands, and in some cases utterly wiping\nout whole populations (the neighboring city of Veii was obliterated in roughly 393 BCE, for\nexample, right at the start of the conquest period). The Greek historian Polybius calmly noted at\nthe time in his sweeping history of the republic that insofar as there was a deliberate intention\nbehind all of this cruelty, it was easy to identify: causing terror.\nRoman soldiers were inspired by straightforward greed as well as the tremendous\ncultural importance placed on winning military glory. Nothing was as important to a male Roman\ncitizen as his reputation as a soldier. Likewise, Roman aristocrats all acquired their political\npower through military glory until late in the republic, and even then military glory was all but\nrequired for a man to achieve any kind of political importance. The greatest honor a Roman\ncould win was a triumph, a military parade displaying the spoils of war to the cheers of the\npeople of Rome; many people held important positions in Rome, but only the greatest generals\nwere ever rewarded with a triumph.\nThe overall picture of Roman culture is of a society that was in its own way as fanatical\nand obsessed with war as was Sparta during the height of its barracks society. Unlike Sparta,\nhowever, Rome was able to mobilize gigantic armies, partly because slaves came to perform\nmost of the work on farms and workshops over time, freeing up free Roman men to participate\nin the annual invasions of neighboring territories. One prominent contemporary historian of\nRome, W.V. Harris, wisely warns against the temptation of \u201cpower worship\u201d when studying\nRoman history. Rome did indeed accomplish remarkable things, but it did so through appalling\ncruelty and astonishing levels of violence.\n150 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Punic Wars\nRome's great rival in this early period of expansion was the North-African city of\nCarthage, founded centuries earlier by Phoenician colonists. Carthage was one of the richest\nand most powerful trading empires of the Hellenistic Age, a peer of the Alexandrian empires to\nthe east, trading with them and occasionally skirmishing with the Ptolemaic armies of Egypt and\nwith the Greek cities of Sicily. Rome and Carthage had long been trading partners, and for\ncenturies there was no real reason for them to be enemies since they were separated by the\nMediterranean. That being said, as Rome\u2019s power increased to encompass all of Italy, the\nCarthaginians became increasingly concerned that Rome might pose a threat to its own\ndominance.\nConflict finally broke out in 264 BCE in Sicily. The island of Sicily was one of the oldest\nand most important areas for Greek colonization. There, a war broke out between the two most\npowerful poleis, Syracuse and Messina. The Carthaginians sent a fleet to intervene on behalf of\nMessinans, but the Messinans then called for help from Rome as well (a betrayal of sorts from\nthe perspective of Carthage). Soon, the conflict escalated as Carthage took the side of\nSyracuse and Rome saw an opportunity to expand Roman power in Sicily. The Centuriate\nAssembly voted to escalate the Roman military commitment since its members wanted the\npotential riches to be won in war. This initiated the First Punic War, which lasted from 264 to\n241 BCE. (Note: \u201cPunic\u201d refers to the Roman term for Phoenician, and hence Carthage and its\ncivilization.)\nThe Romans suffered several defeats, but they were rich and powerful enough at this\npoint to persist in the war effort. Rome benefited greatly from the fact that the Carthaginians did\nnot realize that the war could grow to be about more than just Sicily; even after winning victories\nthere, the Carthaginians never tried to invade Italy itself (which they could have done, at least\nearly on). The Romans eventually learned how to carry out effective naval warfare and\nstranded the Carthaginian army in Sicily. The Carthaginians sued for peace in 241 BCE and\nagreed to give up their claims to Sicily and to pay a war indemnity. The Romans, however,\nbetrayed them and seized the islands of Corsica and Sardinia as well, territories that were still\nunder the nominal control of Carthage.\n151 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nFrom the aftermath of the First Punic War and the seizure of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica\nemerged the Roman provincial system: the islands were turned into \u201cprovinces\u201d of the Republic,\neach of which was obligated to pay tribute (the \u201ctithe,\u201d meaning tenth, of all grain) and follow the\norders of Roman governors appointed by the senate. That system would continue for the rest of\nthe republican and imperial periods of Roman history, with the governors wielding enormous\npower and influence in their respective provinces.\nUnsurprisingly, the Carthaginians wanted revenge, not just for their loss in the war but for\nRome\u2019s seizure of Corsica and Sardinia. For twenty years, the Carthaginians built up their\nforces and their resources, most notably by invading and conquering a large section of Spain,\ncontaining rich mines of gold and copper and thousands of Spanish Celts who came to serve as\nmercenaries in the Carthaginian armies. In 218 BCE, the great Carthaginian general Hannibal\n(son of the most successful general who had fought the Romans in the First Punic War)\nlaunched a surprise attack in Spain against Roman allies and then against Roman forces\nthemselves. This led to the Second Punic War (218 BCE - 202 BCE).\nHannibal crossed the Alps into Italy from Spain with 60,000 men and a few dozen war\nelephants (most of the elephants perished, but the survivors proved very effective, and\nterrifying, against the Roman forces). For the next two years, he crushed every Roman army\nsent against him, killing tens of thousands of Roman soldiers and marching perilously close to\nRome. Hannibal never lost a single battle in Italy, yet neither did he force the Romans to sue for\npeace.\nHannibal defeated the Romans repeatedly with clever tactics: he lured them across icy\nrivers and ambushed them, he concealed a whole army in the fog one morning and then sprang\non a Roman legion, and he led the Romans into narrow passes and slaughtered them. In one\nbattle in 216 BCE, Hannibal\u2019s smaller army defeated a larger Roman force by letting it push into\nthe Carthaginian center, then surrounding it with cavalry. He was hampered, though, by the fact\nthat he did not have a siege train to attack Rome itself (which was heavily fortified), and he\nfailed to win over the southern Italian cities which had been conquered by the Romans a century\nearlier. The Romans kept losing to Hannibal, but they were largely successful in keeping\nHannibal from receiving reinforcements from Spain and Africa, slowly but steadily weakening his\nforces.\nEventually, the Romans altered their tactics and launched a guerrilla war against\nHannibal within Italy, harrying his forces. This was totally contrary to their usual tactics, and the\ndictator Fabius Maximus who insisted on it in 217 BCE was mockingly nicknamed \u201cthe Delayer\u201d\nby his detractors in the Roman government despite his evident success. The Romans\n152 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nvacillated on this strategy, suffering the terrible defeat mentioned above in 216 BCE, but as\nHannibal\u2019s victories grew and some cities in Italy and Sicily started defecting to the Carthaginian\nside, they returned to it.\nA brilliant Roman general named Scipio defeated the Carthaginian forces back in Spain\nin 207 BCE, cutting Hannibal off from both reinforcements and supplies, which weakened his\narmy significantly. Scipio then attacked Africa itself, forcing Carthage to recall Hannibal to\nprotect the city. Hannibal finally lost in 202 BCE after coming as close as anyone had to\ndefeating the Romans. The victorious Scipio, now easily the most powerful man in Rome,\nbecame the first great general to add to his own name the name of the place he conquered: he\nbecame Scipio \u201cAfricanus\u201d - conqueror of Africa.\nThe Punic Wars over time - note how much Carthage\u2019s empire was reduced by the end of the\nSecond Punic War, encompassing only the region marked in purple around Carthage itself.\n153 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nAn uneasy peace lasted for several decades between Rome and Carthage, despite\nenduring anti-Carthaginian hatred in Rome; one prominent senator named Cato the Elder\nreputedly ended every speech in the Senate with the statement \u201c\u2026and Carthage must be\ndestroyed.\u201d Rome finally forced the issue in the mid-second century BCE by meddling in\nCarthaginian affairs. The third and last Punic War that ensued was utterly one-sided: it began in\n149 BCE, and by 146 BCE Carthage was defeated. Not only were thousands of the\nCarthaginian people killed or enslaved, but the city itself was brutally sacked (the comment by\nPolybius regarding the terror inspired by Rome, noted above, was specifically in reference to the\nhorrific sack of Carthage). The Romans created a myth to commemorate their victory, claiming\nthat they had \u201cplowed the earth with salt\u201d at Carthage so that nothing would ever grow there\nagain - that was not literally true, but it did serve as a useful legend as the Romans expanded\ntheir territories even further.\nGreece\nRome expanded eastward during the same period, eventually conquering all of Greece,\nthe heartland of the culture the Romans so admired and emulated. While Hannibal was busy\nrampaging around Italy, the Macedonian King Philip V allied with Carthage against Rome, a\nreasonable decision at the time because it seemed likely that Rome was going to lose the war.\nIn 201 BCE, after the defeat of the Carthaginians, Rome sent an army against Philip to defend\nthe independence of Greece and to exact revenge. There, Philip and the king of the Seleucid\nempire (named Antiochus III) had agreed to divide up the eastern Mediterranean, assuming\nthey could defeat and control all of the Greek poleis. An expansionist faction in the Roman\nsenate successfully convinced the Centuriate Assembly to declare war. The Roman legions\ndefeated the Macedonian forces without much trouble in 196 BCE and then, perhaps\nsurprisingly, they left, having accomplished their stated goal of defending Greek independence.\nRome continued to fight the Seleucids for several more years, however, finally reducing the\nSeleucid king Antiochus III to a puppet of Rome.\nDespite having no initial interest in establishing direct control in Greece, the Romans\nfound that rival Greek poleis clamored for Roman help in their conflicts, and Roman influence in\nthe region grew. Even given Rome\u2019s long standing admiration for Greek culture, the political\nand military developments of this period, from 196 - 168 BCE, helped confirm the Roman belief\nthat the Greeks were artistic and philosophical geniuses but, at least in their present iteration,\nwere also conniving, treacherous, and lousy at political organization. There was also a growing\n154 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nconservative faction in Rome led by Cato the Elder that emphasized Roman moral virtue over\nGreek weakness.\nPhilip V\u2019s son Perseus took the throne of Macedon in 179 BCE and, while not directly\nthreatening Roman power, managed to spark suspicion among the Roman elite simply by\nreasserting Macedonian sovereignty in the region. In 172 BCE Rome sent an army and\nMacedon was defeated in 168 BCE. Rome split Macedon into puppet republics, plundered\nMacedon\u2019s allies, and lorded over the remaining Greek poleis. Revolts in 150 and 146 against\nRoman power served as the final pretext for the Roman subjugation of Greece. This time, the\nRomans enacted harsh penalties for disloyalty among the Greek cities, utterly destroying the\nrich city of Corinth and butchering or enslaving tens of thousands of Greeks for siding against\nRome. The plunder from Corinth specifically also sparked great interest in Greek art among\nelite Romans, boosting the development of Greco-Roman artistic traditions back in Italy.\nThus, after centuries of warfare, by 140 BCE the Romans controlled almost the entire\nMediterranean world, from Spain to Anatolia. They had not yet conquered the remaining\nHellenistic kingdoms, namely those of the Seleucids in the Near East and the Ptolemies in\nEgypt, but they controlled a vast territory nonetheless. Even the Ptolemies, the most genuinely\nindependent power in the region, acknowledged that Rome held all the real power in\ninternational affairs.\nThe last great Hellenistic attempt to push back Roman control was in the early first\ncentury BCE, with the rise of a Greek king, Mithridates VI, from Pontus, a small kingdom on the\nsouthern shore of the Black Sea. Mithridates led a large anti-Roman coalition of Hellenistic\npeoples first in Anatolia and then in Greece itself starting in 88 BCE. Mithridates was seen by\nhis followers as a great liberator from Roman corruption (one Roman governor had molten gold\npoured down his throat to symbolize the just punishment of Roman greed). He went on to fight\na total of three wars against Rome, but despite his tenacity he was finally defeated and killed in\n63 BCE, the same year that Rome extinguished the last pitiful vestiges of the Seleucid kingdom.\n155 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nA Roman bust of Mithridates VI sculpted in the first century CE (i.e. over a century after\nMithridates was defeated) by a Roman sculptor. Here, he is depicted in the lion headdress of\nHercules - the implication is that the Romans respected his ferocity in historical hindsight, even\nthough he had been a staunch enemy of Rome.\nUnder the leadership of a general and politician, Pompey (\u201cthe Great\u201d), both Mithridates\nand the remaining independent formerly Seleucid territories were defeated and incorporated\neither as provinces or puppet states under the control of the Republic. With that, almost the\nentire Mediterranean region was under Rome\u2019s sway - Egypt alone remained independent.\n156 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Republic as of 40 BCE. The Republic itself is marked in dark green, with the other colors\nconsisting of other independent states. Many of those would subsequently fall under the sway\nof Rome or be conquered outright (such as Egypt).\nGreco-Roman Culture\nThe Romans had been in contact with Greek culture for centuries, ever since the\nEtruscans struck up their trading relationship with the Greek poleis of southern Italy. Initially, the\nEtruscans formed a conduit for trade and cultural exchange, but soon the Romans were trading\ndirectly with the Greeks as well as the various Greek colonies all over the Mediterranean. By\nthe time the Romans finally conquered Greece itself, they had already spent hundreds of years\nabsorbing Greek ideas and culture, modeling their architecture on the great buildings of the\nGreek Classical Age and studying Greek ideas.\nDespite their admiration for Greek culture, there was a paradox in that Roman elites had\ntheir own self-proclaimed \u201cRoman\u201d virtues, virtues that they attributed to the Roman past, which\nwere quite distinct from Greek ideas. Roman virtues revolved around the idea that a Roman\nwas strong, honest, straightforward, and powerful, while the Greeks were (supposedly) shifty,\n157 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nuntrustworthy, and incapable of effective political organization. The simple fact that the Greeks\nhad been unable to forge an empire except during the brief period of Alexander\u2019s conquests\nconvinced the Romans that they did not possess an equivalent degree of virtue.\nThe Romans summed up their own virtues with the term Romanitas, which meant to be\ncivilized, to be strong, to be honest, to be a great public speaker, to be a great fighter, and to\nwork within the political structure in alliance with other civilized Romans. There was also a\npowerful theme of self-sacrifice associated with Romanitas - the ideal Roman would sacrifice\nhimself for the greater good of Rome without hesitation. In some ways, Romanitas was the\nRomans' spin on the old Greek combination of arete and civic virtue.\nOne example of Romanitas in action was the role of dictator. A Roman dictator, even\nmore so than a consul, was expected to embody Romanitas, leading Rome through a period of\ncrisis but then willingly giving up power. Since the Romans were convinced that anything\nresembling monarchy was politically repulsive, a dictator was expected to serve for the greater\ngood of Rome and then step aside when peace was restored. Indeed, until the first century CE,\ndictators duly stepped down once their respective crises were addressed.\nRomanitas was profoundly compatible with Greek Stoicism (which came of age in the\nHellenistic monarchies just as Rome itself was expanding). Stoicism celebrated self-sacrifice,\nstrength, political service, and the rejection of frivolous luxuries; these were all ideas that\nseemed laudable to Romans. By the first century BCE, Stoicism was the Greek philosophy of\nchoice among many aristocratic Romans (a later Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, was even a\nStoic philosopher in his own right).\nThe implications of Romanitas for political and military loyalty and morale are obvious.\nOne less obvious expression of Romanitas, however, was in public building and celebrations.\nOne way for elite (rich) Romans to express their Romanitas was to fund the construction of\ntemples, forums, arenas, or practical public works like roads and aqueducts. Likewise, elite\nRomans would often pay for huge games and contests with free food and drink, sometimes for\nentire cities. This practice was not just in the name of showing off; it was an expression of one's\nloyalty to the Roman people and their shared Roman culture. The creation of numerous Roman\nbuildings (some of which survive) is the result of this form of Romanitas.\nDespite their tremendous pride in Roman culture, the Romans still found much to admire\nabout Greek intellectual achievements. By about 230 BCE, Romans started taking an active\ninterest in Greek literature. Some Greek slaves were true intellectuals who found an important\nplace in Roman society. One status symbol in Rome was to have a Greek slave who could tutor\none\u2019s children in the Greek language and Greek learning. In 220 BCE a Roman senator,\n158 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nQuintus Fabius Pictor, wrote a history of Rome in Greek, the first major work of Greek literature\nwritten by a Roman (like so many ancient sources, it has not survived). Soon, Romans were\nimitating the Greeks, writing in both Greek and Latin and creating poetry, drama, and literature.\nThat being noted, the interest in Greek culture was muted until the Roman wars in\nGreece that began with the defeat of Philip V of Macedon. Rome\u2019s Greek wars created a kind\nof \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d of Greek art and Greek slaves. Huge amounts of Greek statuary and art\nwere shipped back to Rome as part of the spoils of war, having an immediate impact on Roman\ntaste. The appeal of Greek art was undeniable. Greek artists, even those who escaped slavery,\nsoon started moving to Rome en masse because there was so much money to be made there if\nan artist could secure a wealthy patron. Greek artists, and the Romans who learned from them,\nadapted the Hellenistic Greek style. In many cases, classical statues were recreated exactly by\nsculptors, somewhat like modern-day prints of famous paintings. In others, a new style of\nrealistic portraiture in sculpture that originated in the Hellenistic kingdoms proved irresistible to\nthe Romans; whereas the Greeks of the Classical Age usually idealized the subjects of art, the\nRomans came to prefer more realistic and \u201chonest\u201d portrayals. We know precisely what many\nRomans looked like because of the realistic busts made of their faces: wrinkles, warts and all.\nThe \u201cPatrician Torlonia,\u201d a bust of an unknown Roman politician from sometime in the first\ncentury BCE.\n159 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nAlong with philosophy and architecture, the most important Greek import to arrive on\nRoman shores was rhetoric: the mastery of words and language in order to persuade people\nand win arguments. The Greeks held that the two ways a man could best his rivals and assert\nhis virtue were battle and public discussion and argumentation. This tradition was felt very\nkeenly by the Romans, because those were precisely the two major ways the Roman Republic\noperated \u2013 the superiority of its armies was well-known, while individual leaders had to be able\nto convince their peers and rivals of the correctness of their positions. The Romans thus very\nconsciously tried to copy the Greeks, especially the Athenians, for their skill at oratory.\nNot surprisingly, the Romans both admired and resented the Greeks for the Greek\nmastery of words. The Romans came to pride themselves on a more direct, less subtle form of\noratory than that (supposedly) practiced in Greece. Part of Roman oratorical skill was the use of\npassionate appeals to emotional responses in the audience, ones that were supposed to both\nharness and control the emotions of the speaker himself. The Romans also formalized\ninstruction in rhetoric, a practice of studying the speeches of great speakers and politicians of\nthe past and of debating instructors and fellow students in mock scenarios.\nRoman Society\nMuch of Roman social life revolved around the system of clientage. Clientage consisted\nof networks of \u201cpatrons\u201d \u2013 people with power and influence \u2013 and their \u201cclients\u201d \u2013 those who\nlooked to the patrons for support. A patron would do things like arrange for his or her (i.e. there\nwere women patrons, not just men) clients to receive lucrative government contracts, to be\nappointed as officers in a Roman legion, to be able to buy a key piece of farmland, and so on.\nIn return, the patron would expect political support from their clients by voting as directed in the\nCenturiate or Plebeian Assembly, by influencing other votes, and by blocking political rivals.\nLikewise, clients who shared a patron were expected to help one another. These were open,\npublicly-known alliances rather than hidden deals made behind closed doors; groups of clients\nwould accompany their patron into meetings of the senate or assemblies as a show of strength.\nThe government of the late Republic was still in the form of the Plebeian Assembly, the\nCenturiate Assembly, the Senate, ten tribunes, two consuls, and a court system under formal\nrules of law. By the late republic, however, a network of patrons and clients had emerged that\nlargely controlled the government. Elite families of nobles, through their client networks, made\nall of the important decisions. Beneath this group were the equestrians: families who did not\nhave the ancient lineages of the patricians and who normally did not serve in public office. The\n160 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nequestrians, however, were rich, and they benefited from the fact that senators were formally\nbanned from engaging in commerce as of the late third century BCE. They constituted the\nbusiness class of Republican Rome who supported the elites while receiving various trade and\nmercantile concessions.\nMeanwhile, the average plebeian had long ago lost his or her representation. The\nPlebeian Assembly was controlled by wealthy plebeians who were the clients of nobles. In\nother words, they served the interests of the rich and had little interest in the plight of the class\nthey were supposed to represent. This created an ongoing problem for Rome, one that was\nexploited many times by populist leaders: Rome relied on a free class of citizens to serve in the\narmy, but those same citizens often had to struggle to make ends meet as farmers. As the rich\ngrew richer, they bought up land and sometimes even forced poorer citizens off of their farms.\nThus, there was an existential threat to Rome\u2019s armies, and with it, to Rome itself.\nA comparable pattern existed in the territories - soon provinces - conquered in war.\nRome was happy to grant citizenship to local elites who supported Roman rule, and sometimes\nentire communities could be granted citizenship on the basis of their loyalty (or simply their\nperceived usefulness) to Rome. Citizenship was a useful commodity, protecting its holders from\nharsher legal punishments and affording them significant political rights. Most Roman subjects,\nhowever, were just that: subjects, not citizens. In the provinces they were subject to the\ngoodwill of the Roman governor, who might well look for opportunities to extract provincial\nwealth for his own benefit.\nAt the bottom of the Roman social system were the slaves. Slaves were one of the most\nlucrative forms of loot available to Roman soldiers, and so many lands had been conquered by\nRome that the population of the Republic was swollen with slaves. Fully one-third of the\npopulation of Italy were slaves by the first century CE. Even freed slaves, called freedmen, had\nlimited legal rights and had formal obligations to serve their former masters as clients. Roman\nslaves spanned the same range of jobs noted with other slaveholding societies like the Greeks:\nelite slaves lived much more comfortably than did most free Romans, but most were laborers or\ndomestic servants. All could be abused by their owners without legal consequence.\nSlavery was a huge economic engine in Roman society. Much of the \u201cloot\u201d seized in\nRoman campaigns was made up of human beings, and Roman soldiers were eager to capitalize\non captives they took by selling them on returning to Italy. In historical hindsight, however,\nslavery undermined both Roman productivity and the pace of innovation in Roman society. It\nsimply was not necessary to seek out new and better ways of doing things in the form of\ntechnological progress or social innovations because slave labor was always available. While\n161 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nRoman engineering was impressive, Rome developed no new technology to speak of in its\nthousand-year history. Likewise, the long-term effect of the growth of slavery in Rome was to\nundermine the social status of free Roman citizens, with farmers in particular struggling to\nsurvive as rich Romans purchased land and built huge slave plantations.\nThere were many slave uprisings, the most significant of which was led by Spartacus, a\ngladiator (warrior who fought for public amusement) originally from Thrace. Spartacus led the\nrevolt of his gladiatorial school in the Italian city of Capua in 73 BCE. He set up a war camp on\nthe slopes of the volcano Mt. Vesuvius, to which thousands of slaves fled, culminating in an\n\u201carmy\u201d of about 70,000. He tried to convince them to flee over the Alps to seek refuge in their\n(mostly Celtic) homelands, but was eventually convinced to turn around to plunder Italy. The\nrichest man in Italy, the senator Crassus, took command of the Roman army assembled to\ndefeat Spartacus, crushing the slave army and killing Spartacus in 71 BCE (and lining the road\nto Rome with 6,000 crucified slaves).\nIn one area, however, Rome represented greater freedom and autonomy than did some\nof its neighboring societies (like Greece): gender roles. While Roman culture was explicitly\npatriarchal, with families organized under the authority of the eldest male of the household (the\npater familias), there is a great deal of textual evidence that suggests that women enjoyed\nconsiderable independence nevertheless. Women retained the ownership of their dowries at\nmarriage, could initiate divorce, and controlled their own inheritances. Widows, who were\ncommon thanks to the young marriage age of women and the death of soldier husbands, were\nlegally autonomous and continued to run households after the death of the husband. Within\nfamilies, women\u2019s voices carried considerable weight, and in the realm of politics, while men\nheld all official positions, women exercised considerable influence from behind the scenes.\nIt is easy to overstate women\u2019s empowerment in Roman society; Roman culture\ncelebrated the devoted mother and wife as the female ideal, and Roman traditionalists decried\nthe loosening of strict gender roles that seems to have taken place over time during the\nRepublic. Women were expected to be frugal managers of households and, in theory, they\nwere to avoid ostentatious displays. Likewise, Roman law explicitly designated men as the\nofficial decision-makers within the family unit. That being noted, however, one of the reasons\nthat we know that women did enjoy a higher degree of autonomy than in many other societies is\nthe number of surviving texts that both described and, in many cases, celebrated the role of\nwomen. Those texts were written by both men and women, and most Romans (men very much\nincluded) felt that it was both appropriate and desirable for both boys and girls to be properly\neducated.\n162 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe End of the Republic\nThe Roman Republic lasted for roughly five centuries. It was under the Republic that\nRome evolved from a single town to the heart of an enormous empire. Despite the evident\nsuccess of the republican system, however, there were inexorable problems that plagued the\nRepublic throughout its history, most evidently the problem of wealth and power. Roman\ncitizens were, by law, supposed to have a stake in the Republic. They took pride in who they\nwere and it was the common patriotic desire to fight and expand the Republic among the\ncitizen-soldiers of the Republic that created, at least in part, such an effective army. At the\nsame time, the vast amount of wealth captured in the military campaigns was frequently\nsiphoned off by elites, who found ways to seize large portions of land and loot with each\ncampaign. By around 100 BCE even the existence of the Plebeian Assembly did almost\nnothing to mitigate the effect of the debt and poverty that afflicted so many Romans thanks to\nthe power of the clientage networks overseen by powerful noble patrons.\nThe key factor behind the political stability of the Republic up until the aftermath of the\nPunic Wars was that there had never been open fighting between elite Romans in the name of\npolitical power. In a sense, Roman expansion (and especially the brutal wars against Carthage)\nhad united the Romans; despite their constant political battles within the assemblies and the\nsenate, it had never come to actual bloodshed. Likewise, a very strong component of\nRomanitas was the idea that political arguments were to be settled with debate and votes, not\nclubs and knives. Both that unity and that emphasis on peaceful conflict resolution within the\nRoman state itself began to crumble after the sack of Carthage.\nThe first step toward violent revolution in the Republic was the work of the Gracchus\nbrothers \u2013 remembered historically as the Gracchi (i.e. \u201cGracchi\u201d is the plural of \u201cGracchus\u201d).\nThe older of the two was Tiberius Gracchus, a rich but reform-minded politician. Gracchus,\namong others, was worried that the free, farm-owning common Roman would go extinct if the\ncurrent trend of rich landowners seizing farms and replacing farmers with slaves continued.\nWithout those commoners, Rome's armies would be drastically weakened. Thus, he managed\nto pass a bill through the Centuriate Assembly that would limit the amount of land a single man\ncould own, distributing the excess to the poor. The Senate was horrified and fought bitterly to\nreverse the bill. Tiberius ran for a second term as tribune, something no one had ever done up\nto that point, and a group of senators clubbed him to death in 133 BCE.\n163 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nTiberius's brother Gaius Gracchus took up the cause, also becoming tribune. He\nattacked corruption in the provinces, allying himself with the equestrian class and allowing\nequestrians to serve on juries that tried corruption cases. He also tried to speed up land\nredistribution. His most radical move was to try to extend full citizenship to all of Rome's Italian\nsubjects, which would have effectively transformed the Roman Republic into the Italian\nRepublic. Here, he lost even the support of his former allies in Rome, and he killed himself in\n121 BCE rather than be murdered by another gang of killers sent by senators.\nThe reforms of the Gracchi were temporarily successful: even though they were both\nkilled, the Gracchi\u2019s central effort to redistribute land accomplished its goal. A land commission\ncreated by Tiberius remained intact until 118 BCE, by which time it had redistributed huge tracts\nof land held illegally by the rich. Despite their vociferous opposition, the rich did not suffer\nmuch, since the lands in question were \u201cpublic lands\u201d largely left in the aftermath of the Second\nPunic War, and normal farmers did enjoy benefits. Likewise, despite Gaius\u2019s death, the\nRepublic eventually granted citizenship to all Italians in 84 BCE, after being forced to put down a\nrevolt in Italy. In hindsight, the historical importance of the Gracchi was less in their reforms and\nmore in the manner of their deaths - for the first time, major Roman politicians had simply been\nmurdered (or killed themselves rather than be murdered) for their politics. It became\nincreasingly obvious that true power was shifting away from rhetoric and toward military might.\nA contemporary of the Gracchi, a general named Gaius Marius, took further steps that\neroded the traditional Republican system. Marius combined political savvy with effective\nmilitary leadership. Marius was both a consul (elected an unprecedented seven times) and a\ngeneral, and he used his power to eliminate the property requirement for membership in the\narmy. This allowed the poor to join the army in return for nothing more than an oath of loyalty,\none they swore to their general rather than to the Republic. Marius was popular with Roman\ncommoners because he won consistent victories against enemies in both Africa and Germany,\nand because he distributed land and farms to his poor soldiers. This made him a people's hero,\nand it terrified the nobility in Rome because he was able to bypass the usual Roman political\nmachine and simply pay for his wars himself. His decision to eliminate the property requirement\nmeant that his troops were totally dependent on him for loot and land distribution after\ncampaigns, undermining their allegiance to the Republic.\nA general named Sulla followed in Marius's footsteps by recruiting soldiers directly and\nusing his military power to bypass the government. In the aftermath of the Italian revolt of 88 -\n84 BCE, the Assembly took Sulla\u2019s command of Roman legions fighting the Parthians away and\ngave it to Marius in return for Marius\u2019s support in enfranchising the people of the Italian cities.\n164 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nSulla promptly marched on Rome with his army, forcing Marius to flee. Soon, however, Sulla left\nRome to command legions against the army of the anti-Roman king Mithridates in the east.\nMarius promptly attacked with an army of his own, seizing Rome and murdering various\nsupporters of Sulla. Marius himself soon died (of old age), but his followers remained united in\nan anti-Sulla coalition under a friend of Marius, Cinna.\nAfter defeating Mithridates, Sulla returned and a full-scale civil war shook Rome in 83 \u2013\n82 BCE. It was horrendously bloody, with some 300,000 men joining the fighting and many\nthousands killed. After Sulla\u2019s ultimate victory he had thousands of Marius\u2019s supporters\nexecuted. In 81 BCE, Sulla was named dictator; he greatly strengthened the power of the\nSenate at the expense of the Plebeian Assembly, had his enemies in Rome murdered and their\nproperty seized, then retired to a life of debauchery in his private estate (and soon died from a\ndisease he contracted). The problem for the Republic was that even though Sulla ultimately\nproved loyal to republican institutions, other generals might not be in the future. Sulla could\nhave simply held onto power indefinitely thanks to the personal loyalty of his troops.\nJulius Caesar\nThus, there is an unresolved question about the end of the Roman Republic: when a\nnew politician and general named Julius Caesar became increasingly powerful and ultimately\nbegan to replace the Republic with an empire, was he merely making good on the threat posed\nby Marius and Sulla, or was there truly something unprecedented about his actions? Julius\nCaesar\u2019s rise to power is a complex story that reveals just how murky Roman politics were by\nthe time he became an important political player in about 70 BCE. Caesar himself was both a\nbrilliant general and a shrewd politician; he was skilled at keeping up the appearance of loyalty\nto Rome's ancient institutions while exploiting opportunities to advance and enrich himself and\nhis family. He was loyal, in fact, to almost no one, even old friends who had supported him, and\nhe also cynically used the support of the poor for his own gain.\nTwo powerful politicians, Pompey and Crassus (both of whom had risen to prominence\nas supporters of Sulla), joined together to crush the slave revolt of Spartacus in 70 BCE and\nwere elected consuls because of their success. Pompey was one of the greatest Roman\ngenerals, and he soon left to eliminate piracy from the Mediterranean, to conquer the Jewish\nkingdom of Judea, and to crush an ongoing revolt in Anatolia. He returned in 67 BCE and\nasked the Senate to approve land grants to his loyal soldiers for their service, a request that the\nSenate refused because it feared his power and influence with so many soldiers who were loyal\nto him instead of the Republic. Pompey reacted by forming an alliance with Crassus and with\n165 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nJulius Caesar, who was a member of an ancient patrician family. This group of three is known in\nhistory as the First Triumvirate.\nBusts of the members of the First Triumvirate: Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey.\nEach member of the Triumvirate wanted something specific: Caesar hungered for glory\nand wealth and hoped to be appointed to lead Roman armies against the Celts in Western\nEurope, Crassus wanted to lead armies against Parthia (i.e. the \u201cnew\u201d Persian Empire that had\nlong since overthrown Seleucid rule in Persia itself), and Pompey wanted the Senate to\nauthorize land and wealth for his troops. The three of them had so many clients and wielded so\nmuch political power that they were able to ratify all of Pompey's demands, and both Caesar\nand Crassus received the military commissions they hoped for. Caesar was appointed general\nof the territory of Gaul (present-day France and Belgium) and he set off to fight an infamous\nCeltic king named Vercingetorix.\nFrom 58 to 50 BCE, Caesar waged a brutal war against the Celts of Gaul. He was both\na merciless combatant, who slaughtered whole villages and enslaved hundreds of thousands of\nCelts (killing or enslaving over a million people in the end), and a gifted writer who wrote his own\naccounts of his wars in excellent Latin prose. His forces even invaded England, establishing a\nRoman territory there that lasted centuries. All of the lands he invaded were so thoroughly\nconquered that the descendants of the Celts ended up speaking languages based on Latin, like\nFrench, rather than their native Celtic dialects.\nCaesar's victories made him famous and immensely powerful, and they ensured the\nloyalty of his battle-hardened troops. In Rome, senators feared his power and called on\n166 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nCaesar's former ally Pompey to bring him to heel (Crassus had already died in his ill-considered\ncampaign against the Parthians; his head was used as a prop in a Greek play staged by the\nParthian king). Pompey, fearing his former ally\u2019s power, agreed and brought his armies to\nRome. The Senate then recalled Caesar after refusing to renew his governorship of Gaul and\nhis military command, or allowing him to run for consul in absentia.\nThe Senate hoped to use the fact that Caesar had violated the letter of republican law\nwhile on campaign to strip him of his authority. Caesar had committed illegal acts, including\nwaging war without authorization from the Senate, but he was protected from prosecution so\nlong as he held an authorized military command. By refusing to renew his command or allow\nhim to run for office as consul, he would be open to charges. His enemies in the Senate feared\nhis tremendous influence with the people of Rome, so the conflict was as much about factional\ninfighting among the senators as fear of Caesar imposing some kind of tyranny.\nCaesar knew what awaited him in Rome - charges of sedition against the Republic - so\nhe simply took his army with him and marched off to Rome. In 49 BCE, he dared to cross the\nRubicon River in northern Italy, the legal boundary over which no Roman general was allowed to\nbring his troops; he reputedly announced that \u201cthe die is cast\u201d and that he and his men were\nnow committed to either seizing power or facing total defeat. The brilliance of Caesar's move\nwas that he could pose as the champion of his loyal troops as well as that of the common\npeople of Rome, whom he promised to aid against the corrupt and arrogant senators; he never\nclaimed to be acting for himself, but instead to protect his and his men\u2019s legal rights and to resist\nthe corruption of the Senate.\nPompey had been the most powerful man in Rome, both a brilliant general and a gifted\npolitician, but he did not anticipate Caesar\u2019s boldness. Caesar surprised him by marching\nstraight for Rome. Pompey only had two legions, both of whom had served under Caesar in the\npast and he was thus forced to recruit new troops. As Caesar approached, Pompey fled to\nGreece, but Caesar followed him and defeated his forces in battle in 48 BCE. Pompey himself\nescaped to Egypt, where he was promptly murdered by agents of the Ptolemaic court who had\nread the proverbial writing on the wall and knew that Caesar was the new power to contend with\nin Rome. Subsequently, Caesar came to Egypt and stayed long enough to forge a political\nalliance and carry on an affair with the queen of Egypt: Cleopatra VII, last of the Ptolemaic\ndynasty. Caesar helped Cleopatra defeat her brother (to whom she was married, in the\nEgyptian tradition) in a civil war and to seize complete control over the Egyptian state. She also\nbore him his only son, Caesarion.\n167 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nCaesar returned to Rome two years later after hunting down Pompey's remaining\nloyalists. There, he had himself declared dictator for life and set about creating a new version of\nthe Roman government that answered directly to him. He filled the Senate with his supporters\nand established military colonies in the lands he had conquered as rewards for his loyal troops\n(which doubled as guarantors of Roman power in those lands, since veterans and their families\nwould now live there permanently). He established a new calendar, which included the month\nof \u201cJuly\u201d named after him, and he regularized Roman currency. Then he promptly set about\nmaking plans to launch a massive invasion of Persia.\nInstead of leading another glorious military campaign, however, in March of 44 BCE\nCaesar was assassinated by a group of senators who resented his power and genuinely desired\nto save the Republic. The result was not the restoration of the Republic, however, just a new\nchapter in the Caesarian dictatorship. Its architect was Caesar\u2019s heir, his grand-nephew\nOctavian, to whom Caesar left (much to almost everyone\u2019s shock) almost all of his vast wealth.\nMark Antony and Octavian\nFollowing his death, Caesar's right-hand man, a skilled general named Mark Antony,\njoined with Octavian and another general named Lepidus to form the \u201cSecond Triumvirate.\u201d In\n43 BCE they seized control in Rome and then launched a successful campaign against the old\nrepublican loyalists, killing off the men who had killed Caesar and murdering the strongest\nsenators and equestrians who had tried to restore the old institutions. Mark Antony and\nOctavian soon pushed Lepidus to the side and divided up control of Roman territory - Octavian\ntaking Europe and Mark Antony taking the eastern territories and Egypt. This was an\narrangement that was not destined to last; the two men had only been allies for the sake of\nconvenience, and both began scheming as to how they could seize total control of Rome\u2019s vast\nempire.\nMark Antony moved to the Egyptian city of Alexandria, where he set up his court. He\nfollowed in Caesar\u2019s footsteps by forging both a political alliance and a romantic relationship\nwith Cleopatra, and the two of them were able to rule the eastern provinces of the Republic in\ndefiance of Octavian. In 34 BCE, Mark Antony and Cleopatra declared that Cleopatra\u2019s son by\nJulius Caesar, Caesarion, was the heir to Caesar (not Octavian), and that their own twins were\nto be rulers of Roman provinces. Rumors in the west claimed that Antony was under\nCleopatra\u2019s thumb (which is unlikely: the two of them were both savvy politicians and seem to\nhave shared a genuine affection for one another) and was breaking with traditional Roman\nvalues, and Octavian seized on this behavior to claim that he was the true protector of Roman\n168 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nmorality. Soon, Octavian produced a will that Mark Antony had supposedly written ceding\ncontrol of Rome to Cleopatra and their children on his death; whether or not the will was\nauthentic, it fit in perfectly with the publicity campaign on Octavian\u2019s part to build support against\nhis former ally in Rome.\nA dedication featuring Cleopatra VII making an offering to the Egyptian goddess Isis. Note the\nremarkable mix of Egyptian and Greek styles: the image is in keeping with traditional Egyptian\ncarvings, and Isis is an ancient Egyptian goddess, but the dedication itself is written in Greek.\nWhen he finally declared war in 32 BCE, Octavian claimed he was only interested in\ndefeating Cleopatra, which led to broader Roman support by avoiding the premise of yet\nanother Roman civil war. Antony and Cleopatra\u2019s forces were already fairly scattered and weak\ndue to a disastrous campaign against the Persians a few years earlier. In 31 BCE, Octavian\ndefeated Mark Antony's forces, which were poorly equipped, sick, and hungry. Antony and\n169 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nCleopatra\u2019s soldiers were starved out by a successful blockade engineered by Octavian and his\nfriend and chief commander Agrippa, and the unhappy couple killed themselves the next year in\nexile. Octavian was 33. As his grand-uncle had before him, Octavian began the process of\nmanipulating the institutions of the Republic to transform it into something else entirely: an\nempire.\nConclusion\nOne of the peculiar things about the Roman Republic is that its rise to power was in no\nway inevitable. No Roman leader had a \"master plan\" to dominate the Mediterranean world,\nand the Romans of 500 BCE would have been shocked to find Rome ruling over a gigantic\nterritory a few centuries later. Likewise, the demise of the Republic was not inevitable. The\nclass struggles and political rivalries that ultimately led to the rise of Caesar and then to the true\ntransformation brought about by Octavian could have gone very differently. Perhaps the most\nimportant thing that Octavian could, and did, do was to recognize that the old system was no\nlonger working the way it should, and he thus set about deliberately creating a new system in its\nplace. For better or for worse, by the time of his death in 14 CE, Octavian had permanently\ndismantled the Republic and replaced it with the Roman Empire.\nImage Citations (Wikimedia Commons):\nRomulus and Remus - Stinkzwam\nExpansion of the Republic - Javierfv1212\nPunic Wars - Javierfv1212\nMithridates VI - Eric Gaba\nMap of the Republic - Alvaro qc\nPatrician Torlonia - Unknown\nFirst Triumvirate - Andreas Wahra\nCleopatra VII - Jastrow\n170 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nChapter 9: The Roman Empire\nIntroduction\nWhen Octavian succeeded in defeating Marc Antony, he removed the last obstacle to his\nown control of Rome's vast territories. While paying lip service to the idea that the Republic still\nsurvived, he in fact replaced the republican system with one in which a single sovereign ruled\nover the Roman state. In doing so he founded the Roman Empire, a political entity that would\nsurvive for almost five centuries in the west and over a thousand years in the east.\nThis system was called the Principate, rule by the \u201cFirst.\u201d Likewise, although \u201cCaesar\u201d\nhad originally simply been the family name of Julius Caesar\u2019s line, \u201cCaesar\u201d came to be\nsynonymous with the emperor himself by the end of the first century CE. The Roman terms for\nrule would last into the twentieth century CE: the imperial titles of the rulers of both Russia and\nGermany - \u201cTsar\u201d and \u201cKaiser\u201d - mean \u201cCaesar.\u201d In turn, the English word \u201cemperor\u201d derives\nfrom imperator, the title of a victorious Roman general in the field, which was adopted as yet\nanother honorific by the Roman emperors. The English word \u201cprince\u201d is another Romanism,\nfrom Princeps Civitatis, \u201cFirst Citizen,\u201d the term that Augustus invented for himself. For the sake\nof clarity, this chapter will use the anglicized term \u201cemperor\u201d to refer to all of the leaders of the\nRoman imperial system.\nAugustus\nThe height of Roman power coincided with the first two hundred years of the Roman\nEmpire, a period that was remembered as the Pax Romana: the Roman Peace. It was possible\nduring the period of the Roman Empire's height, from about 1 CE to 200 CE, to travel from the\nAtlantic coast of Spain or Morocco all the way to Mesopotamia using good roads, speaking a\ncommon language, and enjoying official protection from banditry. The Roman Empire was as\nrich, powerful, and glorious as any in history up to that point, but it also represented oppression\nand imperialism to slaves, poor commoners, and conquered peoples.\nOctavian was unquestionably the architect of the Roman Empire. Unlike his great-uncle,\nJulius Caesar, Octavian eliminated all political rivals and set up a permanent hereditary\n171 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nemperorship. All the while, he claimed to be restoring not just peace and prosperity, but the\nRepublic itself. Since the term Rex (king) would have been odious to his fellow Romans,\nAugustus instead referred to himself as Princeps Civitatus, meaning \u201cfirst citizen.\u201d He used the\nSenate to maintain a facade of republican rule, instructing senators on the actions they were to\ntake; a good example is that the Senate \u201casked\u201d him to remain consul for life, which he\ngraciously accepted. By 23 BCE, he assumed the position of tribune for life, the position that\nallowed unlimited power in making or vetoing legislation. All soldiers swore personal oaths of\nloyalty to him, and since he conquered Egypt from his former ally Mark Antony, Augustus was\nworshiped there as the latest pharaoh. The Senate awarded Octavian the honorific Augustus:\n\u201cillustrious\u201d or \u201csemi-divine.\u201d It is by that name, Augustus Caesar, that he is best remembered.\nDespite his obvious personal power, Augustus found it useful to maintain the facade of\nthe Republic, along with republican values like thrift, honesty, bravery, and honor. He instituted\nstrong moralistic laws that penalized (elite) young men who tried to avoid marriage and he\ncelebrated the piety and loyalty of conservative married women. Even as he converted the\ngovernment from a republic to a bureaucratic tool of his own will, he insisted on traditional\nrepublican beliefs and republican culture. This no doubt reflected his own conservative tastes,\nbut it also eased the transition from republic to autocracy for the traditional Roman elites.\nAugustan propaganda was not just a projection of his personal authority, however.\nInstead, works that celebrated Roman cultural values such as those by the poets Virgil and Ovid\nwere translated into many languages and distributed across the empire. In turn, these works\nplayed a major role in the creation of the very idea of Western Civilization. The writings of\nHorace, Ovid, and Virgil were used in Renaissance-era schools more than a thousand years\nlater, and they continued to appear in the poems, essays, and plays of writers from\nShakespeare to Cervantes well into the modern period. This literary tradition served the\nimmediate need for the early Roman Empire to influence the cultures of the numerous societies\nit had conquered, but its long-term consequences were even more profound in that it created\nthe myth of a refined, elitist hierarchy presiding over a unified, obedient empire.\nAs Augustus\u2019s powers grew, he received an altogether novel legal status, imperium\nmajus, that was something like access to the extraordinary powers of a dictator under the\nRepublic. Combined with his ongoing tribuneship and direct rule over the provinces in which\nmost of the Roman army was garrisoned at the time, Augustus\u2019s practical control of the Roman\nstate was unchecked. As a whole, the legal categories used to explain and excuse the reality of\nAugustus\u2019s vast powers worked well during his administration, but sometimes proved a major\nproblem with later emperors because few were as competent as he had been. Subsequent\n172 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nemperors sometimes behaved as if the laws were truly irrelevant to their own conduct, and the\nrelationship between emperor and law was never explicitly defined. Emperors who respected\nRoman laws and traditions won prestige and veneration for having done so, but there was never\na formal legal challenge to imperial authority. Likewise, as the centuries went on and many\nemperors came to seize power through force, it was painfully apparent that the letter of the law\nwas less important than the personal power of a given emperor in all too many cases.\nOne of the more spectacular surviving statues of Augustus. Augustus was, among other things,\na master of propaganda, commissioning numerous statues and busts of himself to be installed\nacross the empire.\nThis extraordinary power did not prompt resistance in large part because the practical\nreforms Augustus introduced were effective. He transformed the Senate and equestrian class\ninto a real civil service to manage the enormous empire. He eliminated tax farming and\nreplaced it with taxation through salaried officials. He instituted a regular messenger service.\nHis forces even attacked Ethiopia in retaliation for attacks on Egypt and he received\n173 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nambassadors from India and Scythia (present-day Ukraine). In short, he supervised the\nconsolidation of Roman power after the decades of civil war and struggle that preceded his\ntakeover, and the large majority of Romans and Roman subjects alike were content with the\ndemise of the Republic because of the improved stability Augustus's reign represented. Only\none major failure marred his rule: three legions (perhaps as many as 20,000 soldiers) were\ndestroyed in a gigantic ambush in the forests of Germany in 9 CE, halting any attempt to\nexpand Roman power past the Rhine and Danube rivers. Despite that disaster, after Augustus\u2019s\ndeath the senate voted to deify him: like his great-uncle Julius, he was now to be worshiped as\na god.\nThe Imperial Dynasties\nThe period of the Pax Romana included three distinct dynasties:\n1. The Julian dynasty: 14 \u2013 68 CE - those emperors related (by blood or adoption) to\nCaesar's line.\n2. The Flavian dynasty: 69 \u2013 96 CE - a father and his two sons who seized power after a\nbrief civil war.\n3. The \u201cFive Good Emperors\u201d: 96 \u2013 180 CE - a \"dynasty\" of emperors who chose their\nsuccessors, rather than power passing to their family members.\nThe Julian Dynasty\nThere is a simple and vexing problem with any discussion of the Roman emperors: the\nsources. While archaeology and the surviving written sources create a reasonably clear basis\nfor understanding the major political events of the Julian dynasty, the biographical details are\nmuch more difficult. All of the surviving written accounts about the lives of the Julian emperors\nwere written many decades, in some cases more than a century, after their reign. In turn, the\ntwo most important biographers, Tacitus and Suetonius, detested the actions and the character\nof the Julians, and thus their accounts are rife with scandalous anecdotes that may or may not\nhave any basis in historical truth (Tacitus is universally regarded as the more reliable, although\nSuetonius\u2019s The Twelve Caesars does make for very entertaining reading). Thus, the\nbiographical sketches below are an attempt to summarize what is known for sure, along with\nsome notes on the scandalous assertions that may be at least partly fabricated.\nWhen Augustus died in 14 CE, his stepson Tiberius (r. 14 \u2013 37 CE) became emperor.\nWhile it was possible that the Senate might have tried to reassert its power, there was no\npolitical will to do so. Only idealistic or embittered senators really dreamed of restoring the\n174 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nRepublic, and a coup would have been rejected by the vast majority of Roman citizens. Under\nthe Caesars, after all, the empire had never been more powerful or wealthy. Genuine\nconcessions had been made to the common people, especially soldiers, and the only people\nwho really lost out in the short term were the old elite families of patricians, who no longer had\npolitical power independent of the emperor (although they certainly retained their wealth and\nstatus).\nTiberius began his rule as a cautious leader who put on a show of only reluctantly\nfollowing in Augustus's footsteps as emperor. He was a reasonably competent emperor for over\na decade, delegating decisions to the Senate and ensuring that the empire remained secure\nand financially solvent. In addition, he oversaw a momentous change to the priorities of the\nRoman state: the Roman Empire no longer embarked on a sustained campaign of expansion as\nit had done ever since the early decades of the Republic half a millennium earlier. This does not\nappear to have been a conscious policy choice on the part of Tiberius, but instead a shift in\npriorities: the Senate was now staffed by land-owning elites who did not predicate their identities\non warfare, and Tiberius himself saw little benefit in warring against Persia or invading Germany\n(he also feared that successful generals might threaten his power, at one point ordering one to\ncall off a war in Germany). The Roman Empire would continue to expand at times in the\nfollowing centuries, but never to the degree or at the pace that it had under the Republic.\nEventually, Tiberius retreated to a private estate on the island of Capri (off the west coast\nof Italy). Suetonius\u2019s biography would have it that on Capri, Tiberius indulged his penchant for\nbloodshed and sexual abuse, which is highly questionable - what is not questionable is that\nTiberius became embittered and suspicious, ordering the murders of various would-be claimants\nto his throne back in Rome, and sometimes ignoring affairs of state. When he died, much to the\nrelief of the Roman populace, great hopes were pinned on his heir.\nThat heir was Gaius (r. 37 - 41 CE), much better known as \"Caligula,\" literally meaning\n\u201clittle boots\u201d but which translates best as \"bootsie.\" As a boy, Caligula moved with his father, a\nfamous and well-liked general related by marriage to the Julians, from army camp to army\ncamp. While he did so he liked to dress up in miniature legionnaire combat boots; hence, he\nwas affectionately dubbed \"Bootsie\" by the troops (one notable translation of the work of\nSuetonius by Robert Graves translates Caligula as \"Bootikins\" instead).\nEven if some of the stories of his personal sadism are exaggerated, there is no doubt\nthat Caligula was a disastrous emperor. According to the biographers, Caligula quickly earned\na reputation for cruelty and megalomania, enjoying executions (or simple murders) as forms of\nentertainment and spending vast sums on shows of power. Convinced of his own godhood,\n175 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nCaligula had the heads of statues of the gods removed and replaced with his own head. He\nliked to appear in public dressed as various gods or goddesses; one of his high priests was his\nhorse, Incitatus, whom he supposedly appointed as a Roman consul. He staged an invasion of\nnorthern Gaul of no tactical significance which culminated in a Triumph (military parade,\ntraditionally one of the greatest demonstrations of power and glory of a victorious general) back\nin Rome.\nMuch of the scandalous gossip about him, historically, is because he was\nunquestionably the enemy of the Senate, seeing potential traitors everywhere and inflicting\nwaves of executions against former supporters. He used trials for treason to enrich himself after\nsquandering the treasury on buildings and public games. He also made senators wait on him\ndressed as slaves, and demanded that he be addressed as \u201cdominus et deus,\u201d meaning\n\"master and god.\" He was finally murdered by a group of senators and guardsmen.\nThe next emperor was Claudius (r. 41 \u2013 54 CE), the one truly competent emperor of the\nJulian line after Augustus. Claudius had survived palace intrigues because he walked with a\nlimp and spoke with a pronounced stutter; he was widely considered to be a simpleton, whereas\nhe was actually highly intelligent. Once in power Claudius proved himself a competent and\nrefreshingly sane emperor, ending the waves of terror Caligula had unleashed. He went on to\noversee the conquest of England, first begun by Julius Caesar decades earlier. He was also a\nscholar, mastering the Etruscan and Punic languages and writing histories of those two\ncivilizations (the histories are now lost, unfortunately). He restored the imperial treasury,\ndepleted by Tiberius and Caligula, and maintained the Roman borders. He also established a\ntrue bureaucracy to manage the vast empire and began the process of formally distinguishing\nbetween the personal wealth of the emperor and the official budget of the Roman state.\nAccording to Roman historians, Claudius was eventually betrayed and poisoned by his\nwife, who sought to have her son from another marriage become emperor. That son was Nero.\nNero (r. 54 \u2013 68 CE) was another Julian who acquired a terrible historical reputation; while he\nwas fairly popular during his first few years as emperor, he eventually succumbed to a\nCaligula-like tendency of having elite Romans (including his domineering mother) killed. In 64\nCE, a huge fire nearly destroyed the city, which was largely built out of wood. This led to the\nlegend of Nero \"playing his fiddle while Rome burned\" - in fact, in the fire's aftermath Nero had\nshelters built for the homeless and set about rebuilding the roughly half of the city that had been\ndestroyed, using concrete buildings and grid-based streets. That said, he did use space cleared\nby the fire to begin the construction of a gigantic new palace in the middle of Rome called the\n\"golden house,\" into which he poured state revenues.\n176 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nNero\u2019s terrible reputation arose from the fact that he unquestionably hounded and\npersecuted elite Romans, using a law called the Maiestas that made it illegal to slander the\nemperor to extract huge amounts of money from senators and equestrians. He also ordered\nimagined rivals and former advisors to kill themselves, probably out of mere jealousy. Besides\nRoman elites, his other major target was the early Christian movement, whom he blamed for the\nfire in Rome and whom he relentlessly persecuted (thousands were killed in the gladiatorial\narena, ripped apart by wild animals). Thus, the two groups in the position to write Nero's history\n- elite Romans and early Christians - had every reason to hate him. In addition, Nero took great\npride in being an actor and musician, two professions that were considered by Roman elites to\nbe akin to prostitution. His artistic indulgences were thus scandalous violations of elite\nsensibilities. After completely losing the support of both the army and the Senate, Nero\ncommitted suicide in 68 CE.\nAnother note on the sources: what the \"bad\" emperors of the Julian line (Tiberius,\nCaligula, and Nero) had in common is that they violated the old traditions of Romanitas,\nsquandering wealth and glorifying themselves in various ways, thus inspiring hostility from many\nelite Romans. Since it was other elite Romans (albeit many years later) who became their\nbiographers, we in the present cannot help but have a skewed view of their conduct. Historians\nhave rehabilitated much of the rule of Tiberius and (to a lesser extent) Nero in particular, arguing\nthat even if they were at loggerheads with the Senate at various times and probably did unfairly\nprosecute at least some senators, they did a decent job of running the empire as well.\nThe Flavian Dynasty\nIn the aftermath of Nero's death, a brief civil war broke out. Four generals competed for\nthe emperorship, supported by their armies. In the end, a general named Vespasian (r. 69 \u2013 79\nCE) seized power and founded a fairly short-lived dynasty consisting of himself and his two\nsons, known to history as the Flavians. The importance of Vespasian\u2019s takeover was that it\nreinforced the idea that real power in Rome was no longer that of the old power-broking\nfamilies, but instead the armies; Vespasian had no legal claim to the throne, but his emperorship\nwas ratified by the Senate nevertheless. The emperor's major concern had to be maintaining\nthe loyalty of the armies above all else, because they could and would openly fight to put their\nman on the throne in a time of crisis - this occurred numerous times in the centuries to come.\nVespasian was one of the great emperors of the early empire. He pulled state finances\nback from the terrible state they had been left in by Nero and restored the relationship between\nthe emperor and the Roman elite; it certainly did not hurt his reputation that he was a successful\n177 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ngeneral, one of the traditional sources of status among Roman leaders. He was also renowned\nfor his openness and his grounded outlook. Reputedly, he did not keep a guard and let people\nspeak to him directly in public audiences. In an act of classic Romanitas, he started work on the\nfamous Colosseum (known at the time as the Flavian Amphitheater) in Rome in order to provide\na grand setting for public games and performances. All of this happened in just a decade; he\ndied of natural causes in 79 CE.\nThe outside of the Colosseum in present-day Rome.\nVespasian's older son Titus (r. 79 \u2013 81 CE) had been groomed to follow his father and\nbegan as a promising and competent emperor. Unfortunately, almost as soon as he took the\nthrone Mt. Vesuvius, a volcano in southern Italy, erupted followed shortly by another huge fire as\nwell as an epidemic in Rome. Titus struggled to aid victims of all three disasters, but was then\nstruck by fever and died in 81 CE.\nVespasian's second son, Domitian (r. 81 \u2013 96 CE), who was not \"supposed\" to take the\nthrone, proved to be a terrible ruler. He created an atmosphere of terror in elite Roman circles\nin an effort to watch out for potential rebels, murdering senators and elites he suspected. He\nadopted a Caligula-like concern for glorifying himself (like Caligula, he insisted that he be\naddressed as \u201cdominus et deus\u201d) and liked to appear before the senate in the armor of a Roman\ncommander returning from victory. He was moralistic about both sex and the divinity of the\nemperors, instituting a policy that all oaths had to be sworn to the godhood of the emperor.\n178 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nAbout the only positive undertaking in his rule was major building projects, both for palaces for\nhimself and public works (including roads and fortifications), and it is also worth noting that the\nempire remained under a stable administration during his reign. That noted, Domitian became\nincreasingly paranoid and violent between 89 and 96 CE, until he was finally killed by assassins\nin the palace.\nThe \"Five Good Emperors\" and the Severans\nFollowing the work of the great eighteenth-century English historian Edward Gibbon,\nhistorians frequently refer to the rulers of the Roman Empire who followed the death of Domitian\nas the \u201cFive Good Emperors,\u201d those who successfully managed the Empire at its height. For\nalmost a century, emperors appointed their own successors from the most competent members\nof the younger generation of Roman elites. Not least because none of them (except the last, to\ndisastrous consequences) had surviving direct heirs of their own, each emperor would adopt a\nyounger man as his son, thereby ensuring his succession. Rome prospered during this period\nunder this relatively meritocratic system of political succession. It was under one of these\nemperors, Trajan, that the empire achieved its greatest territorial expanse.\nOne of the important aspects of the behavior of the \u201cgood emperors\u201d is that they fit the\nmodel of a \"philosopher-king\" first described by Plato centuries earlier. Even though monarchy\nhad been repugnant to earlier Romans, during the period of the Republic, the good emperors\ntried to live and act according to traditional Romanitas, undertaking actions not only for their\nown glorification but for the good of the Roman state. The borders were maintained (or, as\nunder Trajan, expanded), public works and infrastructure built, and infighting among elites kept\nto a minimum.\nTrajan\u2019s accomplishments deserve special mention, not only because of his success in\nexpanding the Empire, but in how he governed it. He was a fastidious and straightforward\nadministrator, focusing his considerable energies on the practical business of rule. He\npersonally responded to requests and correspondence, he instituted a program of inexpensive\nloans to farmers and used the interest to pay for food for poor children, and he worked closely\nand successfully with the Senate to maintain stability and imperial solvency. The fact that he\npersonally led the legions on major military campaigns capped his reign in the military glory\nexpected of an emperor following the rule of the Flavians, but he was remembered at least as\nwell for his skill as a leader in peacetime.\nThe next two emperors, Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, did not win comparable military\nglory, but they did defend the borders (Hadrian gave up Trajan\u2019s conquests in Mesopotamia to\n179 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ndo so, recognizing that they were unsustainable), oversaw major building projects, and\nmaintained Roman stability. Hadrian spent much of his reign touring the Roman provinces,\nparticularly Greece. It was clear by his reign that the emperor\u2019s authority was practically\nlimitless, with both emperors issuing imperial proclamations known as \u201crescripts\u201d while away\nfrom Rome that carried the force of law.\nThis period of successful rule eventually broke down when the practice of choosing a\ncompetent follower ended \u2013 the emperor Marcus Aurelius, a brilliant leader and Stoic\nphilosopher (161 \u2013 180 CE) named his arrogant and foolish son Commodus (r. 177 \u2013 192 CE)\nhis co-emperor three years before Aurelius\u2019s death. Storm clouds had already been gathering\nunder Aurelius, who found himself obliged to lead military campaigns against incursions of\nGermanic tribes in the north despite his own lack of a military background (or, really,\ntemperament). He had, however, been a scrupulously efficient and focused political leader. His\ndecision to make Commodus his heir was due to a simple fact: Aurelius was the first of the Five\nGood Emperors to have a biological son who survived to adulthood. As emperor, Commodus\nindulged his taste for debauchery and ignored affairs of state, finally being assassinated after\ntwelve years of incompetence.\nOne last dynasty emerged in the aftermath of Commodus\u2019s death, that of the Severans\nwho ruled from 192 - 235 CE. They faced growing threats on the Roman borders, as Germanic\ntribes staged repeated (and often at least temporarily successful) incursions to the north and a\nnew Persian dynasty known as the Sasanians pressed against Roman territory to the east. The\nlast Severan emperor, Severus Alexander, died in 235 CE, ushering in a terrible period of\nmilitary defeat and instability considered in the next chapter.\nBeyond The Empire\nAs noted above, by the year 117 CE under Trajan the Empire reached its greatest size.\nIt encompassed most of England across to Germany and Romania, all of North Africa from\npresent-day Morocco, and extended to the borders of the Persian Empire. Beyond these\nborders were \u201cbarbarians\u201d of various kinds; as far as the Romans were concerned there were\nno civilized people outside of their borders except the Persians. Trajan's successor, the\nemperor Hadrian, built an enormous series of fortifications to consolidate power on the frontiers\n- these were eventually (by the third century CE) known as the limes, permanent garrisons and\nfortresses that were meant to serve as barriers to prevent \"barbarian\" incursions. Some of\n180 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthese survive to the present, including Hadrian's Wall in northern England. While fleets patrolled\nthe rivers and oceans, these garrisons controlled access to the empire.\nThe Empire at the height of its territorial expanse under Trajan in 117 CE, including the Latin\nnames of its provinces.\nAs far as the Romans were concerned, there were only two things beyond those\nborders: to the north and northeast, endless tracts of inhospitable land and semi-human\nbarbarians like the Germanic tribes, and to the east, the only other civilization Rome was\nprepared to recognize: the Persians, ruled first by the Parthians and then the Sasanians. For\nthe rest of the Roman Imperial period, Rome and Persia periodically engaged in both raiding\nand full-scale warfare, with neither side proving capable of conclusively defeating the other.\n181 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nPersia Under the Parthians\nParthian history is difficult to establish because almost no sources survive besides\nRoman and Greek accounts of battle against the Parthians. What is clear is that the Parthians\ndeliberately built on the achievements of the earlier Achaemenid and Seleucid periods, adopting\nthe title of king of kings, basing their empire (as of the 120s BCE) out of Ctesiphon, a city near\nBabylon in Mesopotamia, and ruling over a shifting confederation of both the settled peoples of\nMesopotamia and Persia itself and of nomadic tribal confederations. Importantly, the Parthians\nwere able to clinch control of major Silk Road trade routes, even receiving the first ever formal\ndiplomatic contact with China in the West in the process, and thus had a solid economic\nfoundation for their military and political control of the region.\nPersia had long stood as the only adversary Rome was unable to defeat. In a stark\ncontrast to Roman tactics, Persia relied on cavalry instead of infantry, including both heavy,\narmored lancers and highly mobile mounted bowmen. Persian forces refused to engage in\nhand combat with Roman soldiers whenever possible and simply rained arrows on them from\nhorseback instead (using compound bows capable of penetrating Roman armor). Probably the\nmost notorious Roman defeat was that of the forces led by Crassus, Julius Caesar\u2019s ally in the\nFirst Triumvirate. In 53 BCE at a site known as Carrhae, the Persians slew 20,000 Roman\ntroops, took 10,000 prisoners, and killed Crassus to boot. That battle led to a grudging\nadmiration on the part of the Romans, who were forced to acknowledge that they had finally met\ntheir match.\nThe closest Rome came to defeating the Persians was under Trajan when he managed\nto conquer Armenia and parts of Mesopotamia, but after his death Rome swiftly abandoned\nthose territories. Even as they fought, however, Persia and Rome still traded, and Rome also\nadopted various Persian technologies and military tactics (for example, Rome adopted irrigation\ntechniques from Persia, and Persia adopted engineering techniques from Rome). Out of\nnecessity, Rome learned to add heavy cavalry units to its legions by the fourth century CE.\nLittle else is known about Persia during the Parthian period. The Roman sources would\nhave it that the power of the ruling dynasty was limited by both court intrigue and the frequency\nof invasions from the steppes (the usual problem for the settled dynasties of Mesopotamia and\nPersia going back to the very origins of civilization). Parthian storytelling was a rich oral\ntradition, but only fragments and mentions of their epic tales have survived, along with a number\nof inscribed epitaphs and memorials. Both war and trade came and went between Rome and\nPersia, with the Euphrates River existing as the usual boundary between the two empires and\n182 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthe nearby kingdom of Armenia as a buffer state dominated by one power and then the other\nover time. In 224 CE the last Parthian ruler was overthrown by Ardashir I, the leader of the\nSasanian clan, and Persian history moved into a new phase under Sasanian rule (described in\nthe next chapter).\nFarther East and North\nFar beyond Persia was the Chinese Empire, already thousands of years old. China and\nRome never established formal diplomatic ties, although the leaders of both empires knew of\none another. During the entire period of Roman Imperial power, only China could produce silk,\nwhich was highly coveted in Rome. Shipments of silk moved along the aptly-named Silk Road\nacross Central Asia, directly linking the two most powerful empires in the world at the time (via,\nas mentioned above, Persia, which derived huge profits in the process).\nIn addition, a major navigational breakthrough occurred during the time of Augustus,\nwhen the Romans learned to navigate the Indian Ocean using the Monsoon winds to reach\nwestern India. There, they could trade for Chinese silk at much better prices. This journey was\nhugely risky, but if a Roman merchant could pull it off and return to Rome with a cargo hold full\nof silk, he would earn 100 times his investment as profit. Along with spices (especially pepper),\nthe trade for silk eventually drained enormous amounts of gold from Rome, something that\ncreated a serious economic liability over the hundreds of years of exchange.\nThe most important, and threatening, border for Rome was to its north, on the eastern\nand northern banks of the Rhine and Danube rivers. The region the Romans called Germania\nwas an enormous stretch of heavily forested land, which was cold, wet, and uninviting from the\nRoman perspective. The \u201cGermans\u201d were a hugely diverse group of tribes practicing feudal law,\na system of law in which offenses were met with clan-based violent retribution or blood\npayments. For hundreds of years there were complex relationships between various tribes and\nthe Roman empire in which the Romans both fought with and, increasingly, hired German tribes\nto serve as mercenaries. Eventually, some of the Germanic tribes were allowed to settle along\nthe Roman borders in return for payments of tribute to Rome.\nThe two major rivers, the Rhine and the Danube, were the key dividing lines to the north\nof Rome, with Roman legions manning permanent fortifications there. As far as the Romans\nwere concerned, even if they were able to militarily they did not want to conquer German\nterritory. The Romans tended to regard the Germans as being semi-human at best, incapable\nof understanding true civilization. Some Romans did admire their bravery and codes of honor -\nthe same Tacitus who provided much of the information on the early emperors contrasted the\n183 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nsupposed weakness and dissolution of his contemporary Romans with the rough virtue of the\nGermans. That being noted, most Romans believed that the Celts, conquered by Caesar\ncenturies earlier, were able to learn and assimilate to Roman culture, but the Germans,\nsupposedly, were not. Likewise, Germania was assumed to be too cold, too wet, and too\ninfertile to support organized farming and settlement. Thus, the role of the limes was to hold the\nGermans back rather than to stage new wars of conquest. For about three hundred years, they\ndid just that, until the borders started breaking down by the third century CE.\nThe Army and Assimilation\nRome had established control over its vast territory thanks to the strength of the\ncitizen-soldiers of the Republic. As described in the last chapter, however, the republican\nmilitary system declined after the Punic Wars as the number of free, economically independent\nRoman citizens capable of serving in the army diminished. By the first century, most Roman\nsoldiers became career soldiers loyal to a specific general who promised tangible rewards\nrather than volunteers who served only in a given campaign and then returned home to their\nfarms.\nPerhaps the most important thing Augustus did besides establishing the principate itself\nwas to reorganize the Roman legions. He created a standing professional army with regular\npay and retirement benefits, permanently ending the reliance on the volunteer citizen-soldiers\nthat had fought for Rome under the republic. Instead, during the empire, Legionaries served for\ntwenty years and then were put on reserve for another five, although more than half died before\nreaching retirement age. The major benefits of service were a very large bonus paid on\nretirement (equivalent to 13 years of pay!) and land: military colonies spread across the empire\nensured that a loyal soldier could expect to establish a prosperous family line if he lived that\nlong.\nService in the army was grueling and intense. Roman soldiers were expected to be able\nto march over 20 miles in a standard day's march carrying a heavy pack. They were subject to\nbrutal discipline, up to and including summary execution if they were judged to have been\nderelict in their duties - one of the worst was falling asleep on guard duty, punishable by being\nbeaten to death by one's fellow soldiers. Roman soldiers were held to the highest standards of\nunit cohesion, and their combat drills meant they were constantly ready for battle.\n184 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nStarting in the Augustan period, the essential division in the Roman military was the\nlegion, a self-sufficient army unto itself that could be combined with other legions to form a\nfull-scale invasion force but could also operate on its own. During the Augustan period, each\nlegion consisted of 5,400 infantry and 120 cavalry, along with hundreds of specialists such as\nengineers, arrow-makers, and blacksmiths who allowed the legion to operate independently\nwhile traveling. The legions were subdivided into cohorts of 480 men, each of which was led by\na centurion, veterans who had risen through the ranks to lead. The legions were designed to be\nflexible, adaptable, and \u201cstandardized\u201d: each legion was comparable in its organization, down to\nthe placement of the tents in the camps built at the end of every day while the legion was on the\nmarch.\nIn turn, each legion was led by a legionary legate, usually a powerful noble appointed by\nthe imperial government or the emperor himself. These legates were often politicians rather\nthan soldiers, meaning that the key figures in actual battle were the centurions, each of whom\nhad earned his position through exemplary service. Perhaps most important of all was the lead\ncenturion, the First Spear, who dictated tactics on the field.\nWall carvings of a Roman legion in battle, with the characteristic large rectangular shields. A\nregular legionnaire would typically fight in formation using a short sword after throwing javelins\nwhile closing with the enemy.\n185 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe legions were made up of Roman citizens, but not all members of the Roman military\nwere citizens. Instead, as numerous as the legions were auxiliaries: Roman subjects (e.g.\nCelts, North Africans, Syrians, etc.). who nevertheless served the empire. The auxiliaries were\ndivided into cohorts of infantry and alae (\"wings\") of cavalry. In comparison to the\ninfantry-focused Roman legions, the auxiliaries tended to vary their arms - auxiliaries could be\nslingers and archers as well as foot soldiers and cavalry. They tended to serve as scouts and\nsupport for the legions as well as engaging in combat in their own right. As of 23 CE they\nnumbered about 150,000 men, which was the same as the legions at the time. The emperor\nClaudius rewarded 25 years of service with citizenship; by the early second century, all\nauxiliaries gained citizenship on discharge.\nA key legion that stood apart from the rest of the military was the Praetorian Guard,\nwhose major job was defending the emperor himself, followed in priority by the defense of Italy\nand the city of Rome. The Praetorian Guard started as nine cohorts of 480 men, but later each\ncohort was grown to 1,000 men. The terms of service in the Praetorian Guard were very\nattractive: 16 years instead of 25 and pay that was significantly higher (this was a necessity:\nemperors starting with Claudius knew that they were vulnerable to the Praetorians and needed\nto keep them happy and loyal). Not surprisingly, Praetorians were recruited from veteran\nlegionaries. They did not simply serve the emperor in the city of Rome, instead actively\ncampaigning both when defending Roman territory from invasion (which became an increasing\nproblem by the fourth century CE), and with the emperor while on campaign.\nThe army was important in integrating provincial subjects into Roman culture. A soldier\nrecruited from the provinces had to learn Latin, at least well enough to take orders and respond\nto them. Auxiliaries served with men from all over the empire, not just their own home regions,\nand what each soldier had in common was service to Rome. Commanding officers were often\nfrom the Italian heartland, forming a direct link to the Roman center. Military families were a\nreality everywhere, with sons often becoming soldiers after their fathers. Thus, the experience\nof serving in the legions or the auxiliaries tended to promote a shared sense of Roman identity,\neven when soldiers were drawn from areas that had been conquered by Rome in the recent\npast.\nIn the provinces, there was a pattern that took place over a few generations. After being\nconquered by the Romans, there were often resistance movements and rebellions. Those were\nput down with overwhelming and brutal force, often worse than that of the initial invasion.\nEventually, local elites were integrated in the governor's office and ambitious people made sure\ntheir sons learned Latin. Locals started joining the army and, if lucky, returned eventually with\n186 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nmoney and land to show for it. Roman amenities like aqueducts and baths were built and roads\nlinked the province with the rest of the empire. In short, assimilation happened. A few\ngenerations after Roman conquest, many (local elites especially) in a given province would\nidentify with Roman civilization. Regular people in the countryside, meanwhile, would at least\nbe obliged to tolerate Roman rule even if they did not embrace it.\nRoman Society\nRome itself was opulent during this period. The city of Rome boasted eleven aqueducts,\nenormous structures that brought fresh water into the city from miles away. The houses of the\nrich had indoor plumbing with drains that led to public sewers. There were numerous libraries\nand temples, along with public sites for recreation, including public baths, race tracks, and the\nfamous Colosseum, used primarily for displays of lethal gladiatorial combat.\nThe empire as a whole enjoyed levels of commercial and agricultural productivity not\nseen again until the seventeenth century CE. Specialized craftsmen made high-quality goods to\nbe sold on an empire-wide market, with better-off citizens enjoying access to quality tools,\ndishware, linens, and so on, much of which had been manufactured hundreds of miles away.\nWhile the long-term economic pattern was that the wealthier parts of society tended to become\neven richer at the expense of the common people, there was still a substantial \u201cmiddle class\u201d\nthat enjoyed a relatively high standard of living.\nWe should note that, while the Romans are not famous as scientists, they are famous as\narchitects and engineers. The Romans used concrete extensively in building projects. They\nmastered the art of building arches and domes to hold up ceilings without interior supports.\nUsing only gravity, they could transport water dozens of miles, not just in Rome but in other\nmajor cities across the Empire. Roman roads were so well built that some survive to the\npresent, now used by cars rather than the horse-drawn carts they were originally built for.\nEach city built by the Romans in their conquered territory was laid out according to\ncareful plans, with streets built in grids and centered on a public forum with public buildings.\nOne of the reasons that the Romans were so effective in assimilating conquered peoples into\nRoman society was that they built a great deal of infrastructure; being conquered by Rome\nseemed less like a burden when an aqueduct, public baths, and street system appeared within\na generation of the Roman conquest (the relative cultural and religious tolerance of Roman\nculture was also key). All of these cities were linked by the 40,000 miles of roads that stretched\nacross the empire. The primary purpose of these administrative capitals was extracting taxes\n187 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nand other wealth from the local areas and funneling them back to Rome, but they also served as\ngenuine cultural centers. Likewise, even though the roads were often built with troop movement\nin mind, people everywhere could take advantage of them for trade.\nSocial Classes\nThat all being said, there were vast social distances that separated elites and\ncommoners. Even in the city of Rome, most of the citizens lived in squalor, packed into\napartment buildings many stories high, made out of flammable wood, looming over open\nsewers. The rich lived in a state of luxury that probably would not be equaled until the\nRenaissance, but the majority of Romans lived in squalid conditions.\nMost people in the empire were, of course, poor farmers; only a minority of the imperial\npopulation lived in cities. Peasants sometimes joined the army, but most were simply poor folk\nstruggling to get by. They were seasonal laborers, they rented from wealthy landowners, or they\nowned farms but were perpetually threatened by the predatory rich. Over the centuries, poor\nfarmers found it more and more difficult to hold on to their land, both because they could not\ncompete with the enormous, slave-tilled plantations of the rich and because of outright extortion.\nThere are numerous accounts of rich landowners simply forcing small farmers off of land and\nseizing it; the peasants could not afford to battle the rich in court and the rich had few scruples\nabout hiring thugs to terrify the peasants into submission. Once in a great while, a poorer\nRoman citizen could petition an emperor personally for redress and succeed, as could the\noccasional provincial to a governor, but the immense majority of the time the poor (citizen and\nnon-citizen alike) were simply at the mercy of elite landowners.\nOne percent of the population of the empire were members of the aristocracy, those men\nwho were allowed to participate as officials in the imperial government and their families. In\nturn, access to political power was explicitly linked to wealth, a system first introduced by\nAugustus himself. To serve in the imperial senate required an annual income of 1,000,000\nsesterces (the basic coin of the empire). To serve on the governing council of a small city or\ntown required an annual income of 100,000 sesterces. Meanwhile, a typical soldier earned\nabout 1,200 a year, and poor farmers much less. Land ownership was by far the major\ndeterminant of wealth, and with the prevalence of slavery, economies of scale dictated that the\nmore land a given family controlled, the more wealth they could generate.\nThe overall pattern in the Roman Imperial period is that the wealthy were highly\nsuccessful in becoming richer from generation to generation, at the expense of the rest of\nRoman society: the wealth of elite landowners grew approximately eight times from 1 CE to 400\n188 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nCE, with almost no new wealth coming into the Roman economy during that period. Thus, as a\nwhole, social mobility was so limited as to be almost nonexistent (to cite a single example, a\nmember of the equestrian class in the Empire might have about 17,000 times the annual income\nof a poor laborer). Roman elites kept taxes on their own property low, but the provinces were\noften ruthlessly exploited and overall tax levels were high. The immense majority of Roman\ncitizens and subjects were born into the social class they would stay in for their entire lives\nregardless of their own intelligence and competence.\nStill, while they might prey on poor farmers, elite Romans were well aware of the threat\nposed by destitute city-dwellers. Thus, one striking characteristic of the Imperial period was\n\"bread and circus government.\" Building on a precedent originally established by the Gracchi\nduring the Republic, the imperial state distributed free grain (and, later, wine and olive oil) to the\nmale citizens of the city of Rome. Eventually, other Roman cities adopted the practice as well.\nIn addition, public games and theater performances were free, subsidized by the state or by\nelites showing off their wealth (the most popular were circuses: horse races around a track).\nThus, a Roman citizen in one of the large cities could enjoy free bread - although it was not\nenough to sustain an entire family, necessitating at least some source of supplemental income -\nand free entertainment. This policy was both a cynical move on the part of the state to keep\ndown urban unrest and a legal right of urban citizens. Free bread or not, the average life\nexpectancy was 45 years for men and 34 for women, the latter because of the horrible\nconditions of bearing children.\nMeanwhile, fully 40% of the population of Italy were slaves when Augustus took power.\nNot only were slaves captured in war, but children born to slave mothers were automatically\nslaves as well. Some slaves did domestic labor, but most were part of the massive labor force\non huge plantations and in mines. The conditions of life for slaves were often atrocious, and\nstrict oversight and use of violent discipline ensured that no slave revolt ever succeeded\n(despite the best efforts of leaders of revolts, like Spartacus in the first century BCE). Relatively\nlarge numbers of slaves did earn their freedom, and the \"freedmen\" as a class tended to be\ninnovative commercial entrepreneurs, but many slaves had little hope of freedom. Slavery\ndeclined by about 200 CE because supplies started drying up and prices rose; without the\nconstant expansion of the empire, there were far fewer slaves available. By that time, however,\nthe legal and social conditions of farmers had degenerated to the point that they were\nessentially serfs: unfree rural laborers, barely better than slaves themselves.\n189 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nLaw\nFor the republican period and the first few hundred years of the Empire, Roman\njurisprudence was split in the provinces. Provincial people were accountable to their own legal\nsystems so long as they were loyal to Rome and paid their taxes on schedule. The most\nfamous historical example of the overlapping legal systems of the Empire was the biblical trial of\nJesus before the Roman governor Pontius Pilate. Pilate tried to hand the case off to the local\nJewish puppet king, Herod, who in turn refused it and handed Jesus back over to Pilate. In the\nend, Jesus was executed by the Roman government for inciting rebellion, using the traditional\nRoman punishment of crucifixion.\nRoman citizens could always appeal to Roman law if they wanted to, even if they lived in\na province far from Rome. There were many benefits, not least exemption from the local laws\nthat non-citizens were obliged to follow, and wealthy citizens were exempt from the more\nhorrible forms of punishment and execution as well (such as crucifixion). This changed\ndramatically in 212 CE when the emperor Caracalla extended citizenship to all free men and\nwomen (to make it easier to collect taxes). This was an important event because it extended\nRoman law to almost everyone in the empire.\nSome of the concepts and practices of Roman law were to outlive the empire itself.\nRome initiated the tradition of using precedent to shape legal decisions, as well as the idea that\nthere is a spirit to laws that is sometimes more important than a literal interpretation. The\nRomans were the first to codify the idea that someone accused of a crime was innocent until\nproven guilty; this was a totally radical idea in the area of justice, which in the rest of the ancient\nworld normally held the accused guilty unless guilt could be conclusively disproved.\nMuch of Roman law still seems grossly unfair from a contemporary perspective. In\nparticular, laws came to establish a formal divide between the rich and the poor, even in the\ncase of citizens. The rich were protected from torture and painful execution, while the poor\nwere subject to both. Slaves were held in such a subservient position by the law that the\ntestimony of a slave was only allowed in court cases if it had been obtained through torture.\nAnd, over everything else, the decrees of the emperor were the fundamental basis of law itself;\nthey could not be appealed or contested in the name of some kind of imagined higher authority\nor written constitution. The emperor was not just about the law, he was the law.\n190 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nConclusion\nFor the first two centuries of its existence, Rome was overwhelmingly powerful, and its\npolitical institutions were strong enough to survive even prolonged periods of incompetent rule.\nTrouble was afoot on Rome's borders, however, as Germanic groups became more populous\nand better-organized, and as the meritocratic system of the \u201cFive Good Emperors\u201d gave way to\ninfighting, assassination, and civil war. At the same time, what began as a cult born in the\nRoman territory of Palestine was making significant inroads, especially in the eastern half of the\nEmpire: Christianity.\nImage Citations (Wikimedia Commons):\nAugustus Caesar - Till Niermann\nColosseum - Andreas Ribbefjord\nEmpire 117 CE - Aregakn\nRoman Legion - Ursus\n191 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nChapter 10: The Late Empire and Christianity\nRome underwent half a century of crisis in the middle of the third century CE. Beset\nalong its borders and hobbled by constant infighting, the empire was at real risk of collapse for\ndecades. It did not collapse, however, and in fact enjoyed a resurgence of a sort that held the\nRoman state together until the end of the fifth century (the western half of the Empire \u201cfell\u201d in\n476 CE).\nIn fact, the period between the end of the five good emperors and the collapse of Rome\nwas much more complex than one of simple decline and weakness, and even when the city of\nRome could not defend itself, Roman civilization left an enormous, permanent impression on\nWestern Civilization. Perhaps most importantly, what began as an obscure cult in Roman-ruled\nJudea eventually became one of the great world religions - Christianity - thanks to its success in\nspreading throughout the Roman Empire before the western Empire's collapse.\nCrisis and Recovery\nMajor crises affected the Empire from 235 to 284 CE. The basis of these crises was\nincreasing pressure from foreign invaders on the Roman borders coupled with political instability\nwithin the Empire itself. The emperor Severus Alexander was murdered in 235 CE. All of the\nemperors to follow for the next fifty years were murdered or died in battle as well, save one;\nthere were twenty-six emperors in those fifty years, and only one died of natural causes. Many\nemperors stayed on the throne for only a few months before they were killed. Not surprisingly, in\nthis environment, most emperors were only concerned with either seizing the throne or staying\nalive once they had it, meaning they tended to neglect tasks important to the stability of the\nEmpire.\nRome\u2019s internal political problems were somewhat of its own making - the Praetorian\nGuard auctioned off the throne, would-be emperors eagerly assassinated their rivals, and\nRoman elites largely retreated to their enormous estates to profit off of their serfs. Other factors,\nhowever, were external: Rome's international environment grew much worse. In 220 BCE, a\nnew clan - the Sasanians - seized control of Persia. The Sasanians were much more\naggressive and well-organized than the earlier Parthian dynasty had been, and Rome was\nobliged to fight almost constant wars to contain the Persian threat. Simultaneously, the\nGermanic groups along Rome's northern borders were growing larger and better-organized.\n192 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nCenturies of contact with Rome itself had improved agricultural techniques among the Germans,\nleading to population growth. Eventually, these larger, wealthier groups joined together into\nforces that posed serious threats to the Roman borders.\nAs the quality of Roman leadership declined and the threats grew worse, the results\nwere predictable: Rome lost battles and territory. The emperor Valerian was captured by the\nPersian king Shapur I when he led a Roman army against Persia and, according to some\naccounts, was used as the Persian king's personal footstool for climbing up onto his horse.\nAnother emperor rebuilt walls around Rome itself in 270 CE because of the threat of Germanic\ninvaders from the north, who had pushed all the way into northern Italy. Likewise, emperors,\nwho were all generals, traveled constantly with their armies and made their courts wherever\nthey had to while waging campaigns.\nThe defeat of the emperor Valerian, kneeling on the left, before the Persian king Shapur I, on\nhorseback.\nThe problem was that the entire Roman imperial system hinged on the direct, personal\ndecision-making of the emperor himself. The emperor was supposed to oversee all major\nbuilding campaigns, state finances, and the worship of the Roman gods, not just military\nstrategy. His reach, however, was limited by the speed a messenger could travel on horseback.\nAs a result, the machinery of the Roman government ground to a halt whenever the latest\n193 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nemperor was weeks or even months away from Rome. Needless to say, the problem was\nexacerbated when the Empire was torn between rival claimants to the throne - for a few years\ntoward the end of the crisis period the empire proper was split into three competing \u201cempires\u201d'\nunder rival imperial pretenders.\nThe three rival \u201cRoman Empires\u201d as of 271 CE.\nSasanian Persia\nPersia was not, of course, simply the most powerful and well organized threat to the\nRoman Empire. It was an ancient and sophisticated civilization of its own, by the Sasanian\nperiod already nearly eight centuries old under the Achaemenids, Seleucids, and Parthians in\nturn. Drawing on an ancient term for the Persian people, the Sasanians identified their empire\nas Iranshahr, land of the Iranians, and from this point on it is appropriate to refer to Persia as\nIran (this textbook will continue to use the term \u201cPersia\u201d for clarity\u2019s sake, however). Under\nSasanian rule, Persia reached the height of its organization, power, and sophistication during\nthe ancient period.\nWhile the Sasanian kings were obliged to govern both settled peoples and nomads, as\nhad all earlier Persian dynasties, they were more successful in creating a stable system of rule,\nnot just relying on their own charismatic authority. For the first time in its history, Zoroastrianism\nbecame the official state religion and its holy books were codified, in contrast to the earlier oral\ntraditions of the religion. The state made major efforts to increase both agricultural productivity\n194 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nand the amount of land under cultivation, especially in Mesopotamia. The long-distance trade\nroutes that had grown to such importance under Parthian rule continued to expand in scope and\nvolume of trade, as did crafts and manufacturing in Sasanian territory (Sasanian silk textiles\nwere of such high quality that they were even exported to China itself). The Sasanian rulers\ndrew a direct connection between stability, centralization, and prosperity at precisely the same\ntime that the chaos in Rome undermined the Roman commercial economy.\nSasanian centralization built on the (much earlier) Achaemenid tradition. All rulers were\nmembers of the Sasanian family line, and governors of the important provinces were also\nrelated to the extended family. Authority was understood to emanate from the Zoroastrian god\nAhura Mazda himself, and while a degree of regional autonomy was necessitated by the sheer\nsize and diversity of the empire, regional rulers knew themselves to be inferior to the Sasanian\nGreat King. A powerful institutional relationship between the rulers and the magi (Zoroastrian\npriesthood) emerged in which Sasanian rule was justified by the direct, unequivocal support of\nthe religious power structure. And, of course, the religious power structure received the\napproval and support of the royal state in the process, up to and including the only campaigns of\nreligious persecution against non-Zoroastrians in Persian history.\nOne symptom of the success of the Sasanian state is its longevity in the face of nearly\nconstant challenges: it lasted from the Sasanian seizure of power in 220 CE until it was\nconquered during the Arab invasions in 651 CE. Rome and Persia did not war constantly, but\nwhen they did Persia was obligated to devote enormous resources to containing Roman\nrapacity (the buffer state of Armenia changed hands a bewildering number of times in the\nprocess). Invaders from the Central Asian steppes and the mountains of Afghanistan proved an\nongoing security threat to the empire as well, as did the Arab clans to the southwest well before\nthey unified under the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Nevertheless, and in spite of some\nsignificant Roman victories, the Sasanian state remained stable and the economy prosperous\nfor centuries. Likewise, the Sasanian identification of themselves, Iran, and the legacy of\nprevious Persian dynasties fused together the essential ingredients of Persian historical identity.\nSubsequent dynasties would look back to the Sasanians as the model to emulate, just as the\nSasanians had emulated the Achaemenids.\n195 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nDiocletian\nTurning back to Rome, the period of crisis that had made the eastern empire so\nvulnerable to Persian invasion ended with the ascension of the emperor Diocletian in 284 CE.\nDiocletian not only managed to survive for twenty years after taking the throne, he also\nreorganized the empire and pulled it back from the brink. Recognizing that the sheer size of the\nempire was a detriment to its effective governance, Diocletian decided to share power with a\nco-emperor: Diocletian ruled the eastern half of the empire and his co-emperor Maximian ruled\nthe west. Then, about ten years after he took the throne, Diocletian decided to further divide\nresponsibility and each emperor took on a junior emperor. This created the Tetrarchy, the rule of\nfour. Diocletian further subdivided the empire, so that for the rest of his reign, the four\nco-emperors (two \u201caugusti\u201d and two \u201ccaesars\u201d) worked together to administer the entire territory.\nA Roman depiction of the tetrarchy dating from the period of Diocletian\u2019s reign.\nDiocletian\u2019s hope was that the tetrarchy would end the cycle of assassinations. The\njunior emperors were the senior emperors\u2019 respective heirs, destined to assume full power when\ntheir seniors stepped down. When that happened, each new senior emperor would then select\n196 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nnew juniors. The overall effect was, if it worked, a neat succession of power instead of the\nconstant bloodshed and uncertainty that had haunted Roman politics for half a century; this\nsystem was quite similar to the merit-based selection process used during the rule of the Five\nGood Emperors.\nDiocletian also divided the Empire into smaller provinces so that governors had an\neasier time with administration. These provinces were grouped into larger units called dioceses\noverseen by an official called a \u201cvicar.\u201d When Christianity moved from being an illegal cult to the\nofficial religion of the empire (see below), the division of imperial territory into dioceses,\noverseen by vicars, would be adopted by the Catholic Church. That practice persists all the way\nto the present in the administration of the Church.\nTo deal with the threat of both Persia and the Germanic tribes, Diocletian reorganized\nthe Roman army and recruited more soldiers, making it larger than it ever had been. He built\nnew roads for military use to be able to move armies along the borders more efficiently.\nBorrowing from the Persian practice, he emphasized the use of heavy cavalry to respond\nquickly to threats. Finally, even though the army itself was now larger, he made individual\nlegions smaller, so that each legion\u2019s commander no longer had enough power to take over with\na single attack on the current emperor (that worked well enough for Diocletian himself, but it\nmade little difference in the long run).\nState finances were in shambles when Diocletian came to power. To try to deal with the\nproblem, Diocletian reformed the tax system and instituted an official census for taxation\npurposes. He also tried to freeze wages and prices by decree, something that did not work\nsince it created a black market for both goods and labor. Peasants bore the brunt of Diocletian's\nreforms; most independent farmers that still existed were turned into serfs, one step above\nslaves. State tax collectors were so feared that many peasants willingly gave their land to\nwealthy landowners who promised to protect them from the tax agents.\nFinally, Diocletian tried to reinstate religious orthodoxy. He believed that too many people\nhad turned away from worship of the Roman gods, which had in turn brought about the long\nperiod of crisis preceding his takeover. Thus, he went after sects that he thought threatened\nstability, including Christianity. He banned Christian worship and executed several thousand\nChristians who refused to renounce their beliefs in an attempt to wipe out the cult once and for\nall. Needless to say, this was a spectacular failure.\nDiocletian retired in 305 CE due to failing health, as did (reluctantly) his co-emperor in\nthe west. The idea behind the Tetrarchy was that the junior emperors would then become the\nsenior emperors and recruit new juniors - this system worked exactly once, as the junior\n197 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nemperors under Diocletian and Maximian took power. Instead of a smooth transition\ninaugurating a stable new beginning, however, the Empire was yet again plunged into civil war.\nA general (at the time stationed in Britain) named Constantine, son of the Tetrarch Constantius,\nlaunched a military campaign to reunite Rome under his sole rule. By 312 CE he had\nsucceeded, claiming total control and appointing no co-emperor.\nConstantine\nConstantine did away with the system of co-emperors (although it would re-emerge after\nhis death), but otherwise he left things as they had been under Diocletian's reforms. The eastern\nand western halves of the Empire still had separate administrations and he kept up the size and\norganization of the army. He also took a decisive step toward stabilizing the economy by issuing\nnew currency based on a fixed gold standard. The new coin, the solidus, was to be the standard\ninternational currency of the western world for 800 years.\nConstantine\u2019s greatest historical impact, however, was in the realm of religion. He was\nthe first Christian emperor, something that had an enormous effect on the history of Europe and,\nultimately, the world. Before his climactic battle in 312 CE to defeat his last rival to the imperial\nthrone, Constantine had a vision that he claimed was sent by the Christian God, promising him\nvictory if he converted to Christianity. There are plenty of theories about a more cynical\nexplanation for his conversion (most revolving around the fact that Constantine went on to\nplunder the temples of the old Roman gods), but regardless of the fact that he used his\nconversion to help himself to the wealth of \"pagan\" temples, he actively supported Christian\ninstitutions and empowered Christian officials. Ultimately, his sponsorship of Christianity saw it\nexpand dramatically in his lifetime.\nIn 324 CE, Constantine founded a new capital city for the entire empire at the site of the\nancient Greek town of Byzantium, at the intersection of Europe and Anatolia (he renamed it\n\u201cConstantine\u2019s City,\u201d Constantinople, which is today Istanbul). It was at the juncture of the\neastern and western halves of the Empire, with all trade routes between Asia and Europe\npassing through its area of influence. It became the heart of wealth and power in the Empire\nand a Christian \u201cnew beginning\" for Roman civilization itself. The city grew to become one of\nthe great cities of late antiquity and the Middle Ages, fed by grain from Egypt and bringing in\nenormous wealth through trade. Subsequent emperors also built up massive fortifications, walls\nso strong that it took 1,000 years for an enemy to be able to breach them (namely the Ottoman\nTurks, who finally conquered the city in 1453 CE).\n198 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nReligion: Roman Faiths and the birth of Christianity\nRome had always been a hotbed of religious diversity. While the official Roman gods\nwere venerated across the Empire, Roman elites had no objections to the worship of other\ndeities, and indeed many Romans (elites and commoners alike) eagerly embraced foreign\nfaiths. Originating in the Hellenistic kingdoms, many Romans were attracted to mystery\nreligions, cults that promised spiritual salvation to their members. These mystery religions\nshared a belief that the universe was full of magical charms that could lead to spiritual salvation\nor eternal life itself. In many ways, they were more like cults of magic than traditional religious\nfaiths. A worshiper could join multiple mystery religions, intoning chants and prayers and\nparticipating in rituals in hopes of securing good fortune and wealth in life and the possibility of\nspiritual immortality after death.\nEven Rome\u2019s perennial adversary Persia supplied sources of spiritual inspiration to\nRome. Mithras, the Zoroastrian god of war, the sun, and rebirth became immensely popular\namong Romans. Mithrans believed that Mithras had been a soldier, slain by his enemies, who\nthen rose to enjoy eternal life. Roman soldiers campaigning in Persia brought Mithraism back to\nRome since Mithras\u2019s identity as a former soldier made his worship all the more appealing to\nmembers of the Roman military. The worship of Mithras was so popular that, some historians\nhave noted, it is easy to imagine the Roman Empire becoming Mithran instead of Christian if\nConstantine had not converted to the latter faith.\nA relief from an altar of Mithras dating from the second or third century CE. In all of the\ndiscovered Mithran temples, Mithras is depicted slaying a bull, which somehow (the details of\nthe myth are long lost) helped to create the world.\n199 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nIn some cases, non-Roman gods even came to supplant Roman ones; one of the\nSeveran emperors embraced the worship of the Syrian sun god Sol Invictus (meaning \"the\nunconquered sun\") and had a temple built in Rome to honor the god alongside the traditional\nRoman deities. The notion of being as powerful and unstoppable as the sun appealed to future\nemperors, so subsequent emperors tended to venerate Sol Invictus along with the Roman\nJupiter until the triumph of Christianity. In other cases, the worship of non-Roman gods was so\npopular that it simply could not be suppressed in the few cases in which Roman leaders saw a\nneed to. The Egyptian goddess Isis, who was at the heart of the largest mystery cult in the\nentire Mediterranean region, was so popular among both women and men that repeated\nattempts to purge her cult from Rome for being socially disruptive utterly failed.\nThe Jews and Jesus\nThe Roman territory of Palestine was a thorn in Rome's side thanks to the unshakable\nopposition of the Jews. Palestine suffered from heavy taxation and deeply-felt resentment\ntoward the Romans. One key point of contention was that the Jews refused to pay lip service to\nthe divinity of the emperors. The Romans insisted that their subjects participate in symbolic\nrituals acknowledging the primacy of the emperors, but since the Jews were strict monotheists,\nthey would not do so.\nIn 66 CE there was a huge uprising against Rome. It took four years for imperial forces\nto crush the uprising, resulting in the greatest disaster in ancient Jewish history: the permanent\ndestruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 70 CE. In the aftermath, the Romans enslaved or\ndeported much of the Jewish population, which contributed to the phenomenon of the Jewish\ndiaspora, the people without a homeland united only by the Hebrew Bible, the teaching of the\nrabbis, and Jewish cultural traditions. Another uprising decades later (between 132 - 136 CE)\nresulted in the almost complete dispersal of the Jews, to the point that the Jewish homeland\nwas truly lost to them until the foundation of the modern state of Israel in 1948 CE.\nIn the first century CE, Jewish society, especially its leadership, was divided between\nrival groups. Some powerful priests, the Sadducees, claimed that all Jews should follow the 10\nCommandments, but only the priests of the Temple needed to follow the 613 laws and\ninjunctions laid down by Moses. They were opposed by the Pharisees, who insisted that all\nJews had to abide by all of the laws of Moses, and they also preached that a messiah - a savior\n- would soon come to bring about a day of judgment before Yahweh and bring about the\nfulfillment of the Biblical Covenant. In the deserts outside of the major cities, a group called the\n200 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nEssenes emphasized a life of asceticism and mysticism, while across Palestine anti-Roman\nrevolutionaries known as the Zealots advocated for armed revolt against the Roman occupier.\nThe Jewish uprising that occurred against the Romans in 66 CE happened a generation\nafter the death of another Jewish revolutionary of sorts: Jesus of Nazareth. The major source of\ninformation on the life of Jesus are the four Gospels, accounts of his life and teachings\ncomposed after his death by three of his apostles (his closest followers and students), Matthew,\nMark, and John, and another early Christian leader, Luke. The Gospels were transmitted orally\nfor decades before being recorded in their definitive versions; most scholars now date the\nwritten gospels to approximately 90 CE (about sixty years after the death of Jesus). While the\nspecific language of the Gospels is, of course, different, and some of the events described are\nalso described differently, the Gospels agree on most of the major aspects of the life of Jesus.\nAccording to the Gospels, Jesus was the son of the miraculous union of the Holy Spirit,\none of the aspects of the Jewish God Yahweh, and a virgin named Mary. Jesus showed an\naptitude for theological and spiritual understanding at a young age, debating Jewish doctrine\nwith learned Jewish priests when he was still a boy. At the age of thirty, having earned his living\nas a carpenter up to that point, Jesus began to preach a message of salvation that revolved\naround the concept that mankind as a whole could be saved if it sought forgiveness from God\nfor its sins. He traveled and delivered his teachings in the Roman province of Palestine and the\nnearby puppet kingdoms dominated by the Romans for three years, but was then arrested by\nthe Roman authorities for inciting rebellion. In the end, Jesus was executed in the customary\nRoman fashion of crucifixion at the age of 33.\nAccording to the Gospels, Jesus returned to life, with an angel rolling the boulder back\nfrom the entrance to the tomb in which his body had been laid to rest. He renewed his call for\ndevotion to God and the offer of salvation for those who sought forgiveness, then passed into\nthe divine presence. Jesus's followers, led by the twelve apostles, began to teach his lessons to\nothers, and the new religion of Christianity was born. His followers began to refer to Jesus as\n\"the Christ,\" meaning \"the anointed one\" in Greek, a reference to the idea that Jesus was\nanointed to provide salvation for humanity.\nEarly Christianity\nAt the beginning of the Christian faith, there was no single set of texts or beliefs that\nunited Christians. The four major Gospels do not agree on everything, because they were\nwritten by different people from memory (decades after the apostles themselves were alive). It\nwas St. Paul, a Jewish leader who underwent a profound conversion experience and became\n201 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthe foremost Christian evangelist, who popularized the notion that the death of Jesus on the\ncross was part of a divine plan that canceled out human sin. For hundreds of years, Christians\ndebated and argued about what Christ's message had \u201creally\u201d been because many of Jesus's\nteachings were, and are, open to interpretation. Early Christians were divided on very\nsignificant issues, including:\nWhat God did Jesus represent? One cult believed that the God of Christ was not the\nJewish God, who had been vengeful and warlike. According to this sect, Christ's God was a\nmore powerful and loving deity come to save the world from Yahweh.\nWas Jesus the messiah? In Jewish doctrine, the messiah was to be a figure who\nliberated the Jews from oppression and made good on the Covenant between the Jews and\nGod, delivering the Promised Land for all eternity. Many Jews had hoped that Jesus would be a\nrevolutionary against Roman rule and, since Judea remained in Roman hands after his death,\nthey did not believe that Jesus had been the messiah. Early Christians came to insist, following\nPaul, that Jesus had indeed been the messiah, but that the \"liberation\" he offered was spiritual\nin nature, rather than having to do with prosaic politics. In other words, the potential to save\none's soul from damnation superseded the old Covenant.\nWas Jesus human, or was he instead somehow God Himself? He lived like a normal\nman, but according to the gospels he had also performed miracles, and he claimed to be the\nson of God. Likewise, while Jesus lived an exemplary life, he also displayed traits like anger\nand doubt (the latter most famously on the cross when he asked God why He had \u201cforsaken\u201d\nJesus), traits that did not seem those of a \u201cperfect\u201d being. This debate would go on for\ncenturies, with equally pious groups of Christians coming to completely different conclusions\nabout Christ's divine and human natures.\nLikewise, early Christians were torn as to whether everyone could be a Christian, or\ninstead, if membership was limited to the Jews. If Jesus was indeed the specifically Jewish\nmessiah, after all, it did not make sense for a Roman or a Persian or a Celt to be able to\nconvert. In the end, thanks largely to the influence of St. Paul again, most Christians came to\nbelieve that the salvation offered by Christ was potentially universal, and that not just Jews\ncould become Christians as a result.\nUnder the influence of the mystery religions noted above, many early Christians were\nGnostics, meaning \"those who know\" in Greek. The Gnostics believed that Jesus had been a\nsecret-teller, almost a magician, who provided clues in his life and teachings about how to\nachieve union with God. This had more to do with magic than with a recognizable set of\nreligious rituals or customs - for example, many Gnostics believed that it was possible to deduce\n202 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\na series of incantations from Christ's teachings that included hundreds of secret \"names of\nGod.\" If a Gnostic was to properly chant all of the names of God, he would not only achieve\nsalvation but might enjoy power on earth, as well. The Gnostics had no interest in converting\npeople to their version of Christianity; it was a secret they wanted to keep for themselves.\nStill, despite the bewildering diversity of beliefs among early Christians, there were\ncommon themes, most importantly the emphasis Jesus Himself had placed on the spiritual\nneeds of the common people, even social outcasts. The most radical aspect of Christianity was\nits universalism. From Judaism, it inherited the idea that all human beings are spiritually equal.\nOnce the debate about whether non-Jews could become Christians was resolved, it was also\npotentially open to anyone who heard Christianity's teachings and doctrine. Early Christians\nrecognized no social distinctions, which was fundamentally at odds with the entire Roman\nsystem, reliant as it was on formal legal separations between social classes and a stark system\nof social hierarchy. Likewise, one unequivocal requirement placed on Christians was to love\ntheir neighbors, meaning in practice showing kindness and compassion to others regardless of\ntheir social rank. Few concepts could have been more alien to Roman sensibilities.\nChristianity thus at least potentially threatened the hierarchical nature of Roman society.\nLikewise, it inherited from Judaism a strict monotheism that refused to accept the worship of the\nRoman emperors. What made it even more threatening than Judaism, however, was that\nChristianity actively sought out new converts (i.e. Christianity was inherently evangelical, in stark\ncontrast to Judaism which did not seek new members). Roman authorities were thus already\nvery much inclined to be suspicious of the Christians as potential rabble-rousers. In 68 CE, Nero\nblamed the Christians for the huge fire that consumed much of the city of Rome, and hundreds\nof Christians were rounded up and slaughtered in the arena. The persecution of Christians\nbecame a potent symbol for Christianity as a whole. Over a thousand years later, when\nChristianity was firmly entrenched as the religion of Europe, the trope of martyrdom was still\nused to explain righteous suffering.\nEarly Christian Organization\nBefore Constantine's conversion, Christianity expanded through missionary work, which\nsucceeded in founding congregations across the Empire but did not seriously disrupt polytheism\nor the Empire\u2019s religious diversity. Imperial sponsorship changed that because it linked secular\npower to Christian identity. Following Constantine's conversion, being a Christian became a\nway to get ahead in the Roman power structure, and over time it became a liability to remain a\n203 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\npolytheist. Thus, whereas early Christianity had been a religion of the common people, Roman\nelites flocked to convert after Constantine did so in order to stay in the emperor's good graces.\nEarly Christians had already developed a distinct hierarchy dividing priests from\nworshipers. Bishops were the head of each city's congregation, and they supervised a staff of\npriests and deacons who interacted with everyday worshipers and led services. The bishops of\nmain cities, usually the imperial capitals of their respective provinces, came to be called an\narchbishop. Each bishop oversaw activity in the diocese, again following the imperial structure,\nin instructing people in Christian doctrine and in building charity networks. One important effect\nwas that the church actively supported charities for the poor and hungry, a practice which won\nover new converts. This was one of the notable moments in history when a religion linked\ntogether a message of compassion for the needy and real, practical efforts to help the needy. In\nanother strong contrast with Roman practice, Christianity saw disenfranchised groups like\nwomen and the poor (not to mention poor women) play major roles in the church\u2019s organization,\nespecially before \u201cofficial\u201d Christianity came into being under Constantine.\nAlmost immediately after Constantine became a Christian, bishops saw their secular\npower increase dramatically. He allowed bishops to serve as official judges, giving Christians\nthe ability to request a bishop instead of a non-Christian judge in trial. Bishops also moved in\nadministrative circles, representing not just the church but their cities in actions and requests\nbefore governors and assemblies. In short, bishops suddenly assumed power on par with that of\nthe traditional Roman nobility, directly linking power within the Christian church hierarchy to\npower within the Roman political system.\nThe most important bishop was the archbishop of Rome, who for the first few centuries\nof Christianity was just one among several major church leaders. Originally, the archbishops of\ncities like Alexandria and Damascus were of comparable importance to the Roman archbishop,\nbut over time Roman archbishops tried to assert authority over the entire church hierarchy in the\nwest. Their authority, however, was not recognized in much of the eastern part of the Empire,\nand it should be emphasized that it took more than six centuries after Constantine for the\nRoman archbishop\u2019s authority to receive acceptance even in the west. Eventually, however,\nthat authority was at least nominally in place, and the Roman archbishop came to be known as\nthe \"pope,\" meaning simply \"father,\" of the church.\nThe pope's role as leader of the church emerged for a few reasons. First and foremost,\nthe symbolic power of the city of Rome itself gave added weight to the Roman archbishop's\nauthority. Second, there was a doctrinal tie to the Apostle Peter, who was supposed to have\nbeen given the symbolic keys to heaven directly from Christ, which were in turn passed on to his\n204 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nsuccessor in Rome (the archbishop of Rome) before being crucified. Roman archbishops could\nthus argue that the Christian church itself was centered in Rome, and that they inherited the\nspiritual keys to heaven upon taking office - this concept was known as the \u201cPetrine\nSuccession.\u201d By the mid-fifth century CE, the popes were claiming to have total authority over all\nother bishops, and at least some of those bishops (in Western Europe, at any rate) did look to\nRome for guidance. In later centuries, the mere fact that the early popes had claimed that\nauthority, and certain bishops had acknowledged it, was cited as \u201cproof\u201d that the Roman papacy\nhad always been the supreme doctrinal power in the Church as a whole.\nChristianity's Relationship with Non-Christian Religions\nAll across the Empire, massive church buildings were erected by emperors. Right from\nthe beginning of \u201cofficial\u201d Christianity, Constantine financed construction of huge churches,\nincluding the Basilica of St. Peter in what is today the Vatican (at the time it was an obscure\ngraveyard in Rome). The traditional Roman public buildings, including forums, theaters,\nbathhouses and so on, were often neglected in favor of churches, and many temples to Roman\ngods and other public buildings were repurposed as churches.\nOnce it enjoyed the support of the Roman elite, the Christian church began incorporating\nnon-Christian holidays into its own liturgical calendar. December 25 had been the major festival\nof the sun god Sol Invictus, and early Christians embraced the overlap between that celebration\nand Christmas, noting that Christ was like the sun as a source of spiritual life. Other Christian\nholidays like Easter coincided with various fertility festivals that took place in early spring,\naround the time of the spring equinox. The tradition of saint's days, holidays celebrated in\nveneration of specific saints, often overlapped with various non-Christian celebrations. Most\nchurch leaders saw no theological problem with this practice, arguing that the ultimate goal was\nthe salvation of souls through conversion, so it made perfect sense to use existing holy days\nand rituals in order to ease the transition for new converts.\nThat being noted, the incorporation of non-Christian celebrations into the liturgical\ncalendar did not imply that Christians were willing to accept polytheism. Unlike most ancient\nfaiths, Christians could not tolerate the worship of other gods, which they regarded as nothing\nmore than nonexistent delusions that endangered souls. They used the term \u201cpagan,\u201d coming\nfrom the Latin paganus, which means \"country bumpkin\" or \"redneck,\" to describe all worshipers\nof all other gods, even gods that had been worshiped for thousands of years at that point.\nChristians thus used scorn and contempt to vilify worshipers of other gods - \"pagan\" indicated\n205 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthat the non-Christian was both ignorant and foolish, even if he or she was a member of the\nRoman elite.\nIt took about a century for the believers in the old Roman gods, especially the\nconservative aristocracy of Rome, to give up the fight. As money shifted toward building\nChristian churches and away from temples, so did Christians sometimes lead attacks to\ndesecrate the sites of pagan worship. Riots occasionally broke out as Christian mobs attacked\nworshipers of other gods, all with the tacit support of the emperors. In 380 CE the Empire was\nofficially declared to be Christian by the emperor Theodosius I and all people of importance had\nto be, at least nominally, Christians. There was no sustained resistance to Christianity simply\nbecause \u201cpolytheism\u201d or \u201cpaganism\u201d was never a unified system, and it was impossible for\npeople who worshiped a whole range of gods to come together \u201cagainst\u201d Christianity, especially\nwhen it was the official religion of the Empire itself.\nA much more difficult battle, one that it some ways was never really won, had to do with\n\u201cpagan\u201d practices. Everyone in the ancient world, Christians among them, believed in the\nexistence of what is now thought of as \u201cmagic\u201d and \u201cspirits.\u201d Christian leaders came to believe\nthat, in general, magic was dangerous, generated by the meddling of the devil, and that the\nspirits found in nature were almost certainly demons in disguise. There was very little they\ncould do, however, to overturn the entire worldview of their followers, considering that even\nChristian leaders themselves very much believed that spirits and magic were present in the\nworld, demonic or not. Thus, pagan practices like blessing someone after they sneezed (to\nkeep out an invading spirit or demon), throwing salt over one's shoulder to ward off the devil,\nand employing all manner of charms to increase luck were to survive to the present.\nOrthodoxy and Heresy\nChristianity united self-understood \"Western Civilization\" just as Roman culture had a\nfew centuries earlier. At the same time, because of the peculiarities of Christian belief, it was\nalso a potentially divisive force. Christians spoke a host of different languages and lived across\nthe entire expanse of the Empire. As noted above, there were serious debates around who or\nwhat Jesus was. For centuries, there could be no \"orthodoxy,\" meaning \"correct belief,\"\nbecause there was no authority within the church (very much including the popes) who could\nenforce a certain set of beliefs over rival interpretations.\nThe beginning of orthodoxy was in the second and third centuries, when a group of\ntheologians argued that there were three personas or states of the divine being, referred to as\nthe Holy Trinity. In this view, God could exist simultaneously as three beings: God the Father,\n206 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthe being that spoke in the Old Testament, God the Son, Jesus himself, and God the Holy Spirit,\nthe presence of God throughout the universe. This concept did not quell controversy at all,\nthough, because it created a distinct stance that people could disagree with - rival groups of\nChristians came to refer to their enemies as \"heretics,\" from the word \"heresy,\" meaning simply\n\"choice.\"\nIn the late third century, an Egyptian Christian priest named Arius created a firestorm of\ncontroversy when he made a simple logical argument: God the father had created Jesus, so it\ndid not make any sense for Jesus to be the same thing as God. Furthermore, it was impossible\nto be both human and perfect; since Jesus was human, he was imperfect and could not\ntherefore be God, who was perfect. This belief came to be known as \"Arianism\" (note that the\nword has nothing whatsoever to do with the misguided belief in some kind of ancient Germanic\nrace - the \"Aryans\" - so important to Nazi ideology almost two thousand years later). Arianism\nquickly took hold among many people, most importantly among the Germanic tribes of the\nnorth, where Arian Christian missionaries made major inroads. Thus, Arianism quickly became\nthe largest and most persistent heresy in the early Christian church.\nIn 325 CE, only a little over a decade after he had converted to Christianity, Constantine\nassembled a council of church leaders, the Council of Nicaea, to lay Arianism to rest. One of the\nresults was the Nicene Creed, to this day one of the central elements of Catholic Mass. In a\nsingle passage short enough to commit to memory, the Creed declared belief in Christ\u2019s identity\nas part of God (\u201cconsubstantial to the Father\u201d in its present English translation), Christ\u2019s status\nas the son of God and the Virgin Mary, Christ\u2019s resurrection, and the promise of Christ\u2019s return\nat the end of the world. There was now the first \u201cparty line\u201d in the early history of Christianity: a\nspecific set of beliefs backed by institutional authority.\nWhile united in belief, Christians were divided by language, since the western Empire\nstill spoke Latin and the eastern Empire Greek. In 410 the monk Jerome produced a version of\nthe Christian Bible in Latin, the Vulgate, which was to be the main edition in Europe until the\nsixteenth century. Surprising from a contemporary perspective, however, is that it was not until\n1442 (during the Renaissance) that the definitive and in a sense \u201cfinal\u201d version of the Bible was\nestablished by the Western Church when it defined exactly which books of the Old Testament\nwere to be included and which were not.\nMeanwhile, in the east, Greek was not only the language of daily life for many, it was the\nofficial language of state in the Empire and the language of the church. The books of the New\nTestament, starting with the Gospels, were written in Greek in the first place, and the Greek\nintellectual legacy was still very strong. There was an equally strong Jewish intellectual legacy\n207 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthat provided accurate translations from Hebrew and Aramaic to Greek, providing\nGreek-speaking Christians with access to a reliable version of the Old Testament.\nWhile it certainly clarified the beliefs of the most powerful branch of the institutional\nchurch, as the Council of Nicaea defined the official orthodoxy, it guaranteed that there would\nalways be those who rejected that orthodoxy in the name of a different theological interpretation.\nLikewise, the practical issues of lingual and cultural differences undermined the universalism\n(\"Catholicism\") of the Christian Church. Those differences and the diversity of belief would only\ngrow over time.\nMonasticism and Christian Culture\nNear the end of the third century, a new Christian movement emerged that was to have\nmajor ramifications for the history of the Christian world: monasticism. Originally, monasticism\nwas tied to asceticism, meaning self-denial, following the example of an Egyptian holy man\nnamed Antony. In about 280, Antony sold his goods and retreated to the desert to contemplate\nthe divine, eschewing all worldly goods in imitation of the poverty of Christ. He would have\nremained in obscurity except for a book about him written by the bishop Athanasius, The Life of\nAntony, that celebrated Antony's rejection of the material world and embrace of divine\ncontemplation. According to Athanasius, normal life was full of temptation, greed, and sin, and\nthat the holiest life was thus one that rejected it completely in favor of prayer and meditation\naway from human company. Thousands of people followed Antony's example, retreating to the\nwilderness. These early monks were called Anchorites: hermits who lived in deserts, forests, or\nmountains away from the temptations of a normal social existence (although they had to live\nclose enough to civilization for the donations of food that kept them alive).\nOne particularly extreme sect of early monks were the Stylites, from the Greek word\nstylos, meaning \"column.\" The founder of the group, St. Simeon the Stylite, climbed up a pillar\nin Syria and spent the next 30 years living on top of it. He was so famous for his holiness and\nendurance in the face of the obvious physical toll of living on top of a pillar that he attracted\nfollowers from all over the Roman world who came to listen to him preach. Soon, many others\nsought out columns in imitation of Simeon.\n208 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nA depiction of St. Simeon from the sixth century CE. The snake symbolizes the temptation to\nabandon his holy life, presumably by getting down off of the pillar.\nUltimately, pillar-sitting did not become the predominant model of Christian life. Instead,\ngroups of ascetics came together in communities called monasteries. Originally, these early\nmonks spent almost all of their time in prayer, but over time most monastic communities came to\nembrace useful work as well as prayer and meditation. The most important development in the\ndevelopment of monasticism was the work of Benedict, an Italian bishop, who wrote a book\nknown as the Rule in about 529 that laid out how monks should live. The Rule dictated a strict\nschedule for daily life that revolved around prayer, study, and useful work for the monastery\nitself (tending crops and animals, performing labor around the monastery, and so on). Going\nforward, many monasteries became economic powerhouses, owning large tracts of land and\nselling their products at a healthy profit.\nMore important than their economic productivity, at least from the perspective of the\nhistory of ideas, is that monasteries became the major centers of learning, especially in Western\nEurope after the collapse of the western Roman Empire. One of the tasks undertaken by\nmonks was the painstaking hand-copying of books, almost all of which had to do with Christian\ntheology (e.g. the Bible itself, commentaries from important Christian leaders, etc.), but some of\nwhich were classical Greek or Roman writings that would have otherwise been lost. Often,\n209 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthese books were beautifully illustrated by the monks and are referred to as illuminated\nmanuscripts - among the finest examples of medieval art. The monks\u2019 and nuns\u2019 constant\nscribing also advanced the art of writing; the earliest literatures of many vernacular European\nlanguages were products of this manuscript culture.\nOutside of monasteries, churches were built in practically every city and town (and many\nsmall villages) in the Roman sphere of influence. One interesting and, from a contemporary\nperspective, somewhat peculiar phenomenon in early Christianity was the focus on relics: holy\nobjects. Relics were everything from the bones of saints to fragments of the \"True Cross\" on\nwhich Christ was crucified. Each church had to have a relic in its altar (contained in a special\nbox called a reliquary) or it was not considered to be truly holy ground. All relics were not\ncreated equal: the larger the object, or the closer it had been to Christ or the apostles, the more\nholy power it was believed to contain. Thus, a thriving trade in relics (plagued by counterfeits - it\nwas not easy to determine if a given finger bone was really the finger bone of St. Mark!)\ndeveloped in Europe as rival church leaders tried to secure the most powerful relic for their\nchurch. This was not just about the symbolic importance of the relics, as pilgrims would travel\nfrom all over the Roman world to visit the site of noteworthy relics, bringing with them\nconsiderable wealth. Whole regional economies centered on pilgrimage sites as a result.\nChristian Learning\nChristian learning was a complex issue, because, strictly speaking, spiritual salvation\nwas thought to be available to anyone simply by accepting the basic tenets of Christian doctrine.\nIn other words, the whole intellectual world of Greek and Roman philosophy, literature, science,\nand so on did not necessarily relate to the Church's primary task of saving souls. Many church\nleaders were learned men and women, however, and insisted that there was indeed a place for\nlearning within Christianity. The issue was never settled - one powerful church leader, Tertullian,\nonce wrote \u201cwhat does Athens have to do with Rome?\u201d, meaning, why should anyone study the\nGreek intellectual legacy when it was produced by pre-Christian pagans?\nOnce Christianity was institutionalized, church leaders generally came around to the\nimportance of classical learning because it proved useful for administration. A vast\nGreco-Roman literature existed describing governance, science, engineering, etc., all of which\nwas necessary in the newly-Christian Empire. A kind of uneasy balance was struck between\nstudying classical learning, especially things like rhetoric, while warning against the spiritual\ndanger of being seduced by its non-Christian messages.\n210 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe most important thinker who addressed the intersection of Christian and classical\nlearning was St. Augustine of Hippo (a Roman city in North Africa), whose life spanned the late\nfourth and early fifth centuries. Augustine lived through the worst period of Roman decline,\ncompleting his work while his own city was besieged by a Germanic group called the Vandals.\nTo Roman Christians, this posed a huge challenge - if all-powerful God had embraced them,\nwhy was their empire falling apart? Augustine's answer was that life on earth is not ultimately\nsignificant. In his work The City of God, Augustine distinguished between the perfect world of\nheaven, attainable through Christian faith, versus the flawed and imperfect world of the living.\nThis concept explained the decline of the Empire as being irrelevant to the greater mission of\nsalvation. Thus, according to Augustine, all of learning was just a facet of material life; useful in\nits way but totally insignificant compared to the necessity of laying one's soul bare to God and\nwaiting for the second coming of Christ.\nThe irony of these struggles over Christian doctrine versus ancient learning was that the\nissue was decided by the collapse of Rome. When Rome fell to Germanic invaders in the\nmid-fifth century, so began the decline of organized learning - there simply was no funding from\nRoman elites for what had been a robust private school system. In the absence of instruction,\nliterature and philosophy and engineering all but vanished, preserved only in monasteries and in\nthe eastern Empire. Once the western Empire collapsed, the church was the only institution\nthat still supported scholarship (including basic literacy), but over time the levels of literacy and\neducation in Europe unquestionably declined. This decline inspired the contempt of later\nRenaissance thinkers who wrote off the period between the fall of Rome and the beginning of\nthe Renaissance in about 1300 CE as the \u201cDark Ages.\u201d\nUltimately, after the western part of the Roman Empire fell in the late fifth century, it was\nthe Christian Church that carried on at least parts of Roman civilization, learning, and culture.\nOne of the historical ironies of this period of history is that even though Rome's Empire began to\ndecline and (eventually) collapse politically, it lived on thanks to ideas and beliefs that had\noriginally arisen in the Roman context - it lived on ideologically and spiritually.\nThe Fall of Rome\nThe fall of Rome, conventionally dated to 476 CE, is one of the most iconic events in the\nhistory of the western world. For centuries, people have tried to draw lessons from Rome\u2019s\ndecline and fall about their own societies, a practice inspired by the question of how so mighty\nand, at one time, stable a civilization could so utterly disintegrate. The answers have varied\nconsiderably: Rome grew corrupt and weak over time, Rome was infiltrated by \u201cbarbarian\u201d\n211 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ncultures, Rome was simply overcome by overwhelming odds, or perhaps Rome was simply\ntransformed into a different, more diverse set of societies rather than destroyed in so many\nwords. However the events of the period are interpreted, the simple fact remains: the political\nunity of the Roman Empire was shattered by the end of the fifth century CE.\nWhile the debate as to the causes of Rome\u2019s fall will probably never be definitively\nanswered, an important caveat should be noted: Rome did not \"really\" fall for another thousand\nyears, even though the city of Rome itself, along with the western half of the Empire, did indeed\nlose its sovereignty in the face of invasion by Germanic invaders. The Roman capital had\nalready been moved to Constantinople in the early fourth century, and the eastern half of the\nempire remained intact, albeit under constant military pressure, until 1453. Arguably, one of the\nmajor causes for the collapse of the western empire was the fact that the Empire as a whole\nhad focused its resources in the east for a century by the time waves of invaders appeared on\nthe horizon starting in the fourth century CE.\nAt the time, most Christians blamed polytheism and heresy for Rome's fall: it was God's\nwrath exacted on a sinful society. In turn, the remaining polytheists blamed Christians for\nundermining the worship of the gods who had presided over the Empire while Rome was great.\nFrom the contemporary perspective, Rome's fall seems to have less to do with divine\nintervention than routine defeats and growing threats.\nA note on nomenclature: this section will refer to the groups responsible for the\ndestruction of the western empire as \u201cbarbarians\u201d when referring to the Roman perception of\nGermanic and Central Asian groups. The point is not to vilify those groups, but to emphasize\nthe degree to which Romans were both contemptuous towards and, it turns out, vulnerable to\nthem. When possible, it will refer to specific groups by name such as the Goths and the Huns.\nIn addition, it will refer to \u201cGermans\u201d when discussing the specific groups native to Central\nEurope that played such a key role in the fall of Rome. That is something of a misnomer,\nhowever, since there was no kingdom or empire called \u201cGermany\u201d until 1871 CE (i.e. about\n1,400 years later). Thus, when using the term \u201cGermans,\u201d this section is referring to any of the\nGermanic cultural groups of the era rather than the citizens or subjects of a unified country.\nRoman Relations with \u201cBarbarians\u201d\nRomans had always held \"barbarians\" in contempt, and they believed that the lands held\nby barbarians (such as Scotland and Germany) were largely unsuitable for civilization, being too\ncold and wet for the kind of Mediterranean agriculture Romans were accustomed to. Romans\n212 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nbelieved that peoples like the Germans were inferior to subject peoples like the Celts, who could\nat least be made useful subjects (and, later, citizens) of the Empire. For the entire history of the\nEmpire, the Romans never seem to have figured out exactly which groups they were interacting\nwith; they would simply lump them together as \u201cGoths\u201d or even \u201cScythians,\u201d a blanket term\nreferring to steppe peoples. Occasionally, hundreds of years after they \u201cshould have known\nbetter,\u201d Roman writers would actually refer to Germans as Celts.\nIt is easy to overstate this attitude; there were many members of Germanic tribes who\ndid rise to prominence in Rome (one, Stilicho, was one of the greatest Roman generals in the\nlate Empire, and he was half Vandal by birth). Likewise, it is clear from archaeology that many\nGermans made a career of fighting in the Roman armies and then returning to their native\nareas, and that many Germans looked up to Rome as a model of civilization to be emulated, not\nsome kind of permanent enemy. Some Romans clearly did admire things about certain\nGermanic groups, as well - the great Roman historian Tacitus, in his Germania, even praised the\nGermans for their vigor and honor, although he did so in order to contrast the Germans with\nwhat he regarded as his own corrupt and immoral Roman society.\nThat said, it is clear that the overall pattern of contact between Rome and Germania was\na combination of peaceful coexistence punctuated by many occasions of extreme violence.\nVarious tribes would raid Roman lands, usually resulting in brutal Roman reprisals. As the\ncenturies went on, Rome came increasingly to rely on both Germanic troops and on playing\nallied tribes off against hostile ones. In fact, by the late fourth century CE, many (sometimes\neven most) soldiers in \u201cRoman\u201d armies in the western half of the Empire were recruited from\nGermanic groups.\nThe only place worthy of Roman recognition as another \"true\" civilization was Persia.\nWhen Rome was forced to cede territory to Persia in 363 CE after a series of military defeats,\nRoman writers were aghast because the loss of territory represented \u201cabandoning\u201d it to the\nother civilization and state. When \u201cbarbarians\u201d seized territory, however, it rarely warranted any\nmention among Roman writers, since it was assumed that the territory could and would be\nreclaimed whenever it was convenient for Rome.\nMeanwhile, there had been hundreds of years of on-again, off-again wars along the\nRoman borders before the \u201cfall\u201d of Rome actually occurred. Especially since the third century,\nmajor conflicts were an ongoing reality of the enormous borders along the Rhine and Danube.\nThose conflicts had prompted emperors to build the system of limes meant to defend Roman\nterritory, and from that point on, the majority of Roman legions were usually deployed along the\nsemi-fortified northern borders of the empire. There is evidence that many of those soldiers\n213 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nspent their careers as not-so-glorified border guards and administrators and never experienced\nbattle itself; there is no question that the performance of the Roman military was far poorer in\nthe late imperial period than it had been, for instance, under the republic.\nIn turn, many of the Germans who settled along those borders were known as federatii,\ntribal groups who entered into treaties with Rome that required them to pay taxes in kind (i.e. in\ncrops, animals, and other forms of wealth rather than currency) and send troops to aid Roman\nconquests, and who received peace and recognition (and usually annual gifts) in return. The\nproblem for Rome was that most Germanic peoples regarded treaties as being something that\nonly lasted as long as the emperor who had authorized the treaty lived; on his death, there\nwould often be an incursion since the old peace terms no longer held. The first task new\nemperors had to attend to was often suppressing the latest invasion from the north. One\nexample was the Goths, settled at the time somewhere around present-day Romania, whom\nConstantine severely punished after they turned on his forces during his war of conquest\nleading up to 312 CE.\nThe bottom line is that, as of the late fourth century CE, it seemed like \u201cbusiness as\nusual\u201d to most political and military elites in the Roman Empire. The borders were teeming with\n\u201cbarbarians\u201d, but they had always been teeming with barbarians. Rome traded with them,\nenlisted them as soldiers, and fought them off or punished them as Roman leaders thought it\nnecessary. No one in Rome seemed to think that this state of affairs would ever change. What\ncontemporary historians have determined, however, is that things had changed: there were\nmore Germans than ever before, they were better-organized, and they were capable of\ndefeating large Roman forces. What followed was a kind of \"domino effect\" that ultimately broke\nthe western Empire into pieces and ended Roman power over it.\nOne other factor in the collapse of the western half of the Empire should be emphasized:\nonce Rome began to lose large territories in the west, tax revenues shrunk to a fraction of what\nthey had been. While the east remained intact, with taxes going to pay for a robust military\nwhich successfully defended Roman sovereignty, Roman armies in the west were under-funded,\nunder-manned, and vulnerable. There was thus a vicious cycle of lost land, lost revenue, and\npoor military performance that saw Roman power simply disintegrate over the course of less\nthan a century. Even the handful of effective emperors and generals in the west during that\nperiod could not staunch the tide of defeat.\n214 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nInvasions\nThe beginning of the end for the western empire was the Huns. The Huns were warriors\nof the Central Asian steppes: expert horsemen, skillful warriors, unattached to any particular\nland. They had much in common with other groups of steppe peoples like the Scythians who\nhad raided civilized lands going back to the very emergence of civilization in Mesopotamia.\nThey were believed to be so cruel and so unstoppable that the Germanic groups farther west\nclaimed that they were the product of unions between demons and witches rather than normal\nhumans.\nIn 376 the Huns drove a large group of Goths from their lands in southern Russia.\nThose Goths were allowed to settle in the Balkans by the Romans, but were soon extorted by\nRoman officials, causing the Goths to rise up against Rome in retribution. In 378 the Goths\nkilled the emperor, Valens, and destroyed a Roman army in an open battle. The new emperor\nmade a deal with the Goths, allowing them to serve in the Roman army under their own\ncommanders in return for payment. This proved disastrous for Rome in the long run as the\nGoths, under their king Alaric, started looting Roman territory in the Balkans, finally marching\ninto Italy itself and sacking Rome in 410 CE. The western Roman government officially moved\nto the city of Ravenna in the north (which was more defensible) following this sack.\nThe Gothic attack on Rome was the first time in roughly seven hundred years that the\nwalls of Rome had been breached by non-Romans. The entire Roman world was shocked and\nhorrified that mere barbarians could have overwhelmed Roman armies and struck at the heart\nof the ancient Empire itself. Rome\u2019s impregnability was itself one of the founding stories\nRomans told themselves; Romans had long vowed that the Celtic sack of 387 BCE would be\nthe last, and yet the Goths had shattered that myth. With the benefit of historical hindsight, we\ncan see the arrival of the Huns as the beginning of a \"domino effect\" in which various groups\nwere pushed into Roman territory, with the sack of Rome merely one disaster of many for the\nEmpire.\n215 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe major invasions of the Roman Empire leading up to its fall. Note, among other things, their\nastonishing scope: the Goths may have originated in Scandinavia but some of their\ndescendents ended up ruling over Spain, while the Vandals came from somewhere in\npresent-day Germany and conquered Roman North Africa.\nLeading up to that event, the Roman legions were already losing their former coherence\nand unity. In 406 CE a very cold winter froze the Rhine river, and armies of Germans invaded\n(literally walking across the frozen river in some cases), bypassing the traditional Roman\ndefenses. One group, the Vandals, sacked its way to the Roman provinces of Spain and seized\na large swath of territory there. The entire army of Britain left in 407 CE, when yet another\nambitious general tried to seize the imperial throne, and Roman power there swiftly collapsed.\nRoman armies from the western empire hastily marched back to Italy to fight the Goths,\nabandoning their traditional defensive posts. For the next fifty years, various groups of\nGermanic invaders wandered across Europe, both looting and, soon, settling down to occupy\nterritory that had only recently been part of the Roman Empire. Most of these groups soon\nestablished kingdoms of their own. The Vandals pushed through Spain and ended up\nconquering most of Roman North Africa. After the Goths sacked Rome itself in 410, the\nemperor Honorius gave them southern Gaul to get them to leave; they ended up seizing most of\nSpain (from the Vandals who had arrived before them) as well. At that point, the Romans came\nto label this group the Visigoths - \u201cwestern Goths\u201d - to distinguish them from other Gothic tribes\nstill at large in the Empire.\n216 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nBack in Italy, the Huns, under the leadership of the legendary warlord Attila, arrived in\nthe late 440s, pushing as far as the gates of Rome in 451. There, the Pope (Leo I) personally\nappealed to Attila not to sack the city and paid them a hefty bribe. Attila died in 453 and the\nHuns were soon defeated by a combined army of their former Germanic subjects and a Roman\narmy. By then, however, the damage was done: the domino effect set off by the Hunnic\ninvasion of the previous century had already almost completely swallowed up the western\nempire. Only two years after the Huns were defeated, the Vandals sailed over from Africa in\n455 and sacked Rome again. This sacking, despite occurring with relatively little carnage,\nnevertheless led to the use of the word \u201cvandal\u201d to mean a malicious destroyer of property.\nItaly itself held out until 476, when an Ostrogothic (\u201ceastern Goth\u201d) warlord named\nOdoacer deposed the last emperor and declared himself king of Italy. The Roman emperor in\nConstantinople (having little choice) approved of Odoacer\u2019s authority in Italy in return for a\nnominal pledge of loyalty. In 493, Odoacer was deposed and killed by a different Ostrogothic\nking, Theodoric, but the link with Constantinople remained intact. The Roman emperor worked\nout a deal with Theodoric to stabilize Italy, and Theodoric went on to rule for decades (r. 493 -\n526). Thus, by 500 CE Italy and the city of Rome were no longer part of the empire still called\n\"Roman\" by the people of the eastern empire. By the end of the fifth century, the western\nempire was gone, replaced by a series of kingdoms ruled by Germanic peoples but populated\nby former citizens of the Roman Empire.\nTheodoric presided over a few decades of prosperity, restoring peace to the Italian\npeninsula and joining together with other Gothic territories to the west. He maintained excellent\nrelations with the Pope even though he was an Arian Christian, and he set up a system in which\na government existed for his Goths that was distinct from the Roman government (with him at\nthe head of both, of course). Some historians have speculated that Theodoric and the Goths\nmight have been able to forge a new, stable empire in the west and thereby obviate the coming\nof the \"Dark Ages,\" but that possibility was cut short when the Byzantine Empire invaded to try\nto reconquer its lost territory (that invasion is considered in the next chapter).\nIn Gaul, a fierce tribe called the Franks, from whom France derives its name, came to\npower, driving out rivals like the Visigoths. Unlike the other Germanic tribes, the Franks did not\nabandon their homeland when they set out for new territory. From the lower Rhine Valley, they\ngradually expanded into northern Gaul late in the fifth century. Under the leadership of the\nwarrior chieftain Clovis (r. 481/482 - 511), the various Frankish tribes were united, which gave\nthem the military strength to depose the last Roman governor in Gaul, drive the Visigoths into\nSpain, absorb the territory of yet another barbarian group known as the Burgundians, and\n217 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\neventually conquer most of Gaul. Thus, what began as an invasion and occupation of Roman\nterritory evolved in time to become the earliest version of the kingdom of France.\nIn almost every case, the new Germanic kings pledged formal allegiance to the Roman\nemperor in Constantinople in return for acknowledgment of the legitimacy of their rule. They\noften did their best to build on the precedent of Roman civilization as well; for example, Clovis of\nthe Franks made a point of having the Frankish laws recorded in Latin, and over time the\nFrankish language vanished, replaced by the early form of French, a Latinate language. In fact,\nfor well over a century, most Germanic \u201ckings\u201d were, officially, treaty-holding, recognized Roman\nofficials from the legal and diplomatic perspective of Constantinople. That said, the \u201cRoman\u201d\nemperors of Constantinople had plenty of legal pretext to regard those kings as usurpers as\nwell, since the treaties of acknowledgment were often full of loopholes. Thus, when the\nemperor Justinian invaded Italy in the sixth century, he was doing so to reassert not just the\nmemory of the united empire, but to restore it to the legal state in which it already technically\nexisted.\nConclusion\nWhile interpretations of the collapse of the Empire will continue to differ as long as there\nare people interested in Roman history, there is no question about the basic facts: half of what\nhad once been an enormous, coherent, and amazingly stable state was splintered into political\nfragments by the end of the fifth century.\nImage Citations (Wikimedia Commons)\nDefeat of Valerian - Ali Ganjei\nDivided Empire Map - Creative Commons, historicair\nThe Tetrarchy - Dennis Jarvis\nMithras - Jastrow\nSt. Simeon - AxelBoldt\nInvasions Map - MapMaster\n218 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nChapter 11: Byzantium\nAs noted in the last chapter, the eastern half of the Roman Empire survived for 1,000\nyears after the fall of the western one. It carried on most of the traditions of Rome and added\nmany new innovations in architecture, science, religion, and learning. It was truly one of the\ngreat civilizations of world history. And yet, as demonstrated in everything from college curricula\nto representations of ancient history in popular culture, the eastern empire, remembered as\n\u201cByzantium,\u201d is not as well represented in the contemporary view of the past as is the earlier\nunited Roman Empire. Why might that be?\nThe answer is probably this: like the western empire before it, Byzantium eventually\ncollapsed. However, Byzantium did not just collapse, it was absorbed into a distinct culture with\nits own traditions: that of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. More to the point, the religious divide\nbetween Christians and Muslims, at least from the perspective of medieval Europeans, was so\nstark that Byzantium was \u201clost\u201d to the tradition of Western Civilization in a way that the western\nempire was not. Even though the Ottoman Empire itself was a proudly \u201cwestern\u201d civilization,\none that eagerly built on the prosperity of Byzantium after absorbing it, there is a (misguided)\ncenturies-long legacy of distinguishing between the Byzantine - Ottoman culture of the east and\nthe Roman - European medieval culture of the west.\nByzantine civilization\u2019s origins are to be found in the decision by the emperor\nConstantine to found a new capital in the Greek village of Byzantium, renamed Constantinople\n(\u201cConstantine\u2019s city\u201d). By the time the western empire fell, the center of power in the Roman\nEmpire had long since shifted to the east: simply put, by the fifth century CE the majority of\nwealth and power was concentrated in the eastern half of the empire. The people of\nConstantinople and the eastern empire did not call it \"Byzantium\" or themselves \"Byzantines\" -\nthey continued to refer to themselves as \"Romans\" long after Rome itself was permanently\noutside of their territory and control.\nAfter the fall of the western empire, the new Germanic kings acknowledged the authority\nof the emperor in Constantinople. They were formally his vassals (lords in his service) and he\nremained the emperor of the entire Roman Empire in name. At least until the Byzantine Empire\nbegan to decline in the seventh century, this was not just a convenient fiction. Even the Franks,\nwho ruled a kingdom on the other end of Europe furthest from the reach of Constantinople, lived\n219 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nin genuine fear of a Byzantine invasion since the treaties they had established with\nConstantinople were full of loopholes and could be repudiated by any given emperor.\nEast versus West\nWhy was it that the west had fallen into political fragmentation while the east remained\nrich, powerful, and united? There are a few major reasons. First, Constantinople itself played a\nmajor role in the power and wealth of the east. Whereas Rome had shrunk steadily over the\nyears, especially after its sacking in 410 and the move of the western imperial government to\nthe Italian city of Ravenna (which was more easily defensible), Constantinople had somewhere\naround 500,000 residents. That can be compared to the capital of the Gothic kingdom of Gaul,\nToulouse, which had 15,000 (which was a large city by the standards of the time for Western\nEurope!). Not only was Constantinople impregnable to invaders, but its population of proud\nRomans repeatedly massacred barbarians who tried to seize power, and they deposed\nunpopular emperors who tried to rule as military tyrants rather than true emperors possessing\nsufficient Roman \"virtue.\"\nThe Roman Empire after its political division between east and west under Diocletian. From the\nthird through fifth centuries CE, the eastern part of the empire became the true locus of power\nand wealth, and as of the late fifth century, the entire western half \u201cfell\u201d to barbarian invasions.\n220 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe east had long been the richest part of the empire, and because of its efficient\nbureaucracy and tax-collecting systems, much more wealth flowed into the imperial coffers in\nthe east than it did in the west. Each year, the imperial government in Constantinople brought in\nroughly 270,000 pounds of gold in tax revenue, as compared to about 20,000 in the west. This\nmade vastly better-equipped, trained, and provisioned armies possible in the east.\nFurthermore, the west was still dominated by various families of unbelievably rich Roman elites\nwho undermined the power, authority, and financial solvency of the western imperial government\nby refusing to sacrifice their own prerogatives in the name of a stronger united empire. In the\neast, while nobles were certainly rich and powerful, they were nowhere near as powerful as their\nwestern counterparts.\nThere is another factor to consider, one that is more difficult to pin down than the amount\nof tax revenue or the existence of Constantinople\u2019s walls. Simply put, Roman identity - the\ndegree to which social elites, soldiers, and possibly regular citizens considered themselves\n\u201cRoman\u201d and remained loyal to the Empire - seems to have been stronger in the east than the\nwest. This might be explained by the reverse of the \u201cvicious cycle\u201d of defeat and vulnerability\ndescribed in the last chapter regarding the west. In the east, the strength of the capital, the\nsuccess of the armies, and the allegiance of elites to Rome as an idea encouraged the\ncontinued strength of Roman identity. Even if poor farmers still had little to thank the Roman\nstate for in their daily lives, their farms were intact and local leaders were still Roman, not Gothic\nor Frankish or Vandal.\nLastly, the east enjoyed a simple stroke of good luck in the threats it faced from outside\nof the borders: the Goths went west and Persia did not launch major invasions. The initial\nGothic uprising that sparked the beginning of the end for the west was in the Balkans, but the\nGoths were then convinced to go toward Italy. Subsequent invasions from Central Europe were\ndirected at the west. Even though the Huns were from the steppes of Central Asia, they\nestablished their (short-lived) empire in the west. Eastern Roman armies had to repulse threats\nand maintain the borders, but they did not face the overwhelming odds of their western Roman\ncounterparts. Finally, despite Persia\u2019s overall strength and coherence, there was a lull in\nPersian militarism that lasted through the entire fifth century.\n221 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nJustinian\nThe most important early emperor of Byzantium was Justinian, who ruled from 527 to\n565. Justinian was the last Roman emperor to speak Latin as his native tongue; afterwards, all\nemperors spoke Greek. He is remembered for being both an incredibly fervent Christian, a\nmajor military leader, the sponsor of some of the most beautiful and enduring Byzantine\narchitecture in existence, and the husband of probably the most powerful empress in the history\nof the empire, a former actress and courtesan named Theodora.\nJustinian created a tradition that was to last for all of Byzantine history: that of the\nemperor being both the spiritual leader of the Christian Church and the secular ruler of the\nempire itself. By the time the western empire fell, the archbishops of Rome had begun their\nattempts to assert their authority over the church (they would not succeed even in the west for\nmany centuries, however). Those claims were never accepted in the east, where it was the\nemperor who was responsible for laying down the final word on matters of religious doctrine.\nJustinian felt that it was his sacred duty as leader of the greatest Christian empire in the world to\nenforce religious uniformity among his subjects and to stamp out heresy. He called himself\n\u201cbeloved of Christ,\u201d a title the later emperors would adopt as well. While he was never able to\nforce all of his subjects to conform to Christian orthodoxy (especially in rural regions far from the\ncapital city), he did launch a number of attacks and persecutory campaigns against heretical\nsects.\n222 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nModern photograph of the Hagia Sophia, the cathedral built during Justinian\u2019s reign in\nConstantinople. It was converted into a mosque after the conquest of Constantinople by the\nOttoman Turks in 1453 and remains intact to this day.\nOne aspect of Justinian\u2019s focus on Christian purification was the destruction of the\nancient traditions of paganism in Greece and the surrounding areas initiated by his Christian\npredecessors. The Olympics had already been shut down by the emperor Theodosius I back in\n393 CE (he objected to their status as a pagan religious festival, not an athletic competition).\nJustinian insisted that all teachers and tutors convert to Christianity and renounce their teaching\nof the Greek classics; when they refused in 528, he shut down Plato\u2019s Academy, functioning at\nthat point for almost 1,000 years. (Many of the now-unemployed scholars fled to Persia, where\nthey were welcomed by the Sasanian rulers.)\nJustinian did not just enforce religious uniformity, he also imposed Roman law on all of\nhis subjects. The empire had traditionally left local customs and laws alone so long as they did\nnot interfere in the important business of tax collection, troop recruitment, and loyalty to the\nempire. Justinian saw Roman law as an aspect of Roman unity, however, and sought to stamp\nout other forms of law under his jurisdiction. He had legal experts go through the entire corpus\nof Roman law, weed out the contradictions, and identify the laws that needed to be enforced.\nHe codified this project in the Corpus Juris Civilis, which forms the direct textual antecedent for\nmost of the legal systems still in use in Europe.\n223 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nTheodora, who had come from decidedly humble origins as an entertainer, worked\ndiligently both to free prostitutes from sexual slavery, expand the legal rights and protections of\nwomen, and protect children from infanticide. She was Justinian\u2019s confidant and supporter\nthroughout their lives together, helping to conceive of not just legal revisions, but the splendid\nnew building projects they supervised in Constantinople. In a famous episode from early in\nJustinian\u2019s reign, Theodora prevented Justinian and his advisors from fleeing from a massive\nriot against his rule, instead inspiring Justinian to order a counter-attack that may well have\nsaved his reign. While most political marriages in Byzantium, as in practically every pre-modern\nsociety, had nothing whatsoever to do with love or even attraction, Theodora and Justinian\nclearly shared both genuine affection for one another and intellectual kinship.\nThe best-known surviving depiction of Justinian from a mosaic in Ravenna, Italy. In the mosaic,\nJustinian is dressed in the \u201croyal purple,\u201d a color reserved for the imperial family.\nJustinian was intent on re-conquering the western empire from the Germanic kings that\nhad taken over. He was equally interested in imposing Christian uniformity through the\nelimination of Christian heresies like Arianism. He sent a brilliant general, Belisarius, to\nVandal-controlled North Africa in 533 with a fairly small force of soldiers and cavalry, and within\n224 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\na year Belisarius soundly defeated the Vandal army and retook North Africa for the empire.\nFrom there, Justinian dispatched Belisarius and his force to Italy to seize it from the Ostrogoths.\nWhat followed was twenty years of war between the Byzantines and the Gothic kingdom\nof Italy. The Goths had won over the support of most Italians through fair rule and reasonable\nlevels of taxation, and most Italians thus fought against the Byzantines, even though the latter\nrepresented the legitimate Roman government. In the end, the Byzantines succeeded in\ndestroying the Gothic kingdom and retaking Italy, but the war both crippled the Italian economy\nand drained the Byzantine coffers. Italy was left devastated; it was the Byzantine invasion, not\nthe \u201cfall of Rome\u201d earlier, that crippled the Italian economy until the late Middle Ages.\nIn 542, during the midst of the Italian campaign, a horrendous plague (the \u201cPlague of\nJustinian\u201d) killed off half the population of Constantinople and one-third of the empire's\npopulation as a whole. This had an obvious impact on military recruiting and morale. In the\nlong term, the more important impact of the plague was in severing many of the trade ties\nbetween the two halves of the empire. Economies in the west became more localized and less\nconnected to long-distance trade, which ultimately impoverished them. A few years earlier, in\n536, a major volcanic eruption in Iceland spewed so much debris in the air that Europe\u2019s climate\ncooled considerably with \u201cyears without a summer,\u201d badly undermining the economy as well.\nThus, war, natural disaster, and disease helped usher in the bleakest period of the Middle Ages\nin the west, as well as leading to a strong economic and cultural division between west and\neast.\nEven as the Byzantine forces struggled to retake Italy, Justinian, like the emperors to\nfollow him, had a huge problem on his eastern flank: the Persian Empire. Still ruled by the\nSasanians, the Persians were sophisticated and well-organized rivals of the empire who had\nnever been conquered by Rome. Ongoing wars with Persia represented the single greatest\nexpense Justinian faced, even as he oversaw the campaigns in Italy. The Byzantines and\nPersians battled over Armenia, which was heavily populated, and Syria, which was very rich.\nToward the end of his reign, Justinian simply made peace with the Persian king Khusro I by\nagreeing to pay an annual tribute of 30,000 gold coins a year. It was ultimately less expensive\nto spend huge sums of gold as bribes than it was to pay for the wars.\nThe problem with Justinian's wars, both the reconquest in the west and the ongoing\nbattles with the Persians in the east, was that they were enormously expensive. Because his\nforces won enough battles to consistently loot, and because the empire was relatively stable\nand prosperous under his reign, he was able to sustain these efforts during his lifetime. After he\n225 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ndied, however, Byzantium slowly re-lost its conquests in the west to another round of Germanic\ninvasions, and the Persians pressed steadily on the eastern territories as well.\nDivision and Decline\nThe relative political and religious unity Justinian\u2019s campaigns brought back to\nByzantium declined steadily after his death. For almost 1,000 years, the two kinds of\nChristianity - later called \"Catholic\" and \"Eastern Orthodox,\" although both terms speak to the\nidea of one universal and correct form of Christian doctrine - were sundered by the great\npolitical divisions between the Germanic kingdoms of the west and Byzantium itself in the east.\nIn Eastern Europe, small kingdoms and poor farmers played host to rival missionaries preaching\nthe slightly-different versions of Christianity. Trade existed, but was never as strong as it had\nbeen during the days of the united empire.\nByzantium\u2019s major ongoing problem was that it faced a seemingly endless series of\nexternal threats. Byzantium was surrounded by hostile states and groups for most of its\nexistence, and it slowly but steadily lost territory until it was little more than the city of\nConstantinople and its immediate territories. It is important to remember, however, that this\nprocess took many centuries, longer even than the Roman Empire itself had lasted in the west.\nDuring that time, Constantinople was one of the largest and most remarkable cities on the\nplanet, with half a million people and trade goods and visitors from as far away as Scandinavia,\nAfrica, and England. Its people believed that their empire and their emperor were preserved by\nGod Himself as the rightful seat of the Christian religion. Thanks to the resilience of its people,\nthe prosperity of its trade networks, and the leadership of its emperors (the effective ones,\nanyway), Byzantium remained a major state and culture for centuries despite its long-term\ndecline in power from the days of Justinian.\nThe most significant leader after Justinian was the emperor Heraclius (r. 610 \u2013 641). He\nwas originally a governor who returned from his post in Africa to seize the throne from a rival\nnamed Phocas in the midst of a Persian invasion. The empire was in such disarray at the time\nthat the Persians seized Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt, cutting off a huge part of the food supply to\nConstantinople. In the process, the Persians even seized the \u201cTrue Cross,\u201d the cross on which\n(so Christians at the time believed) Christ Himself had been crucified, from its resting place in\nJerusalem. Simultaneously, the Avars and Bulgars, steppe peoples related to the Huns, were\npressing Byzantine territory from the north, and piracy was rife in the Mediterranean.\n226 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nHeraclius managed to save the core of the empire, Anatolia and the Balkans, by\nrecruiting free peasants to fight instead of relying on mercenaries. He also focused on Anatolia\nas the breadbasket of the empire, temporarily abandoning Egypt but keeping his people fed. He\nled Byzantine armies to seize back Jerusalem and the True Cross from the Persians, soundly\ndefeating them in 628, and in 630 he personally returned the True Cross to its shrine in\nJerusalem. The fighting during this period was often desperate - Constantinople itself was\nbesieged by an allied force of Avars and Persians at one point - but in the end Heraclius\nmanaged to pull the empire back from the brink.\nDespite his success in staving off disaster, however, a new threat to Byzantium was\ngrowing in the south. The very same year that Heraclius returned the True Cross to Jerusalem,\nthe Islamic Prophet Muhammad returned to his native city of Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula\nwith the first army of Muslims. Heraclius had no way of knowing it, but Byzantium would soon\nface a threat even greater than that of the Persians: the Arab caliphates (considered in the\nfollowing chapter). Indeed, Heraclius himself was forced to lead Byzantium during the first wave\nof the Arab invasions, and despite his own leadership ability vital territories like Syria, Palestine,\nand Egypt were lost during his own lifetime (he died in 641, the same year that most of Egypt\nwas conquered by the Arabs).\nThemes and Organization\nHeraclius created a new administrative system to try to defend the remaining Byzantine\nterritory: themes. He began by seizing lands from wealthy landowners and monasteries in\nAnatolia, then using the seized land as the basis for new territories from which to recruit\nsoldiers. A theme was a territory, originally about a quarter of the empire in size, organized\naround military recruitment. A single general appointed directly by the emperor controlled each\ntheme. In turn, only soldiers from that theme would serve in it; this led to local pride in the\nmilitary prowess of the theme, which helped morale. It was only because of the success of the\nthemes that Byzantine losses were not much worse, considering the strength of their foreign\nenemies. Eventually, the themes changed further into self-sustaining military systems. Soldiers\nwere granted land to become farmers. From there, they were to fund the purchase of weapons\nfor themselves and their sons. Young men still joined the army, but the system could operate\nwithout significant cash-flow from the imperial treasury back in Constantinople.\nIn essence, the theme system was a return to the ancient manner of military recruitment\nthat had been so successful during the days of the Roman Republic: free citizens who provided\ntheir own arms, thereby relieving some of the financial burden on the state. At their height, the\n227 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthemes supported an army of 300,000 men (comparable to the Roman army under Augustus),\nwith the financial burden evenly distributed across the empire. The four themes were divided\nover the centuries, with villages being watched by a commander and people fighting directly\nalongside their neighbors and families. Ultimately, it was this system, one that encouraged\nmorale and loyalty, that preserved the empire for many centuries. One straightforward\ndemonstration of the strength of the system was that the perennial enemy of Rome, the\nPersians, fell against the Arab invasion of the seventh century while the Byzantines did not.\nThere is an important caveat regarding the consideration of the themes, however. While\nByzantium did indeed survive as a state for many centuries while neighboring empires like\nPersia fell, Byzantium itself arguably ceased to be an \u201cempire\u201d by the middle of the seventh\ncentury CE. The Arab invasions swiftly destroyed Byzantine power in the Near East and North\nAfrica, and while fragments of Justinian\u2019s reconquest remained in Byzantine hands until the\neighth century, \u201cByzantium\u201d was basically synonymous with the contiguous territory of the\nBalkans, Greece, and most of Anatolia by then. It was, despite its continued pretensions to\nempire, really a kingdom after the territorial losses, populated almost entirely by Greek-speaking\n\u201cRomans\u201d rather than by those Romans as well as its former Syrian, Jewish, African, Italian, and\nSpanish subjects.\nImperial Control and Foreign Threats\nJustinian's successors tried to hold on to North Africa, Italy, and Spain by establishing\nterritories called exarchates ruled by governors known as exarchs; exarchates were military\nprovinces in which civilian and military control were united. They held out in Spain until the\n630s, Africa until the end of the seventh century, and Italy until 751, when a Germanic tribe\ncalled the Lombards captured it.\nWhile the losses of territory in Europe were mourned by Byzantines at the time, they\nproved something of a blessing in disguise to the empire: with its territory limited to the Balkans\nand Anatolia, the smaller empire had much more coherent and easily-defended borders. Thus,\nthose core areas remained under Byzantine control despite various losses for many centuries to\ncome. The emperor Leo the Isaurian (r. 717 \u2013 741) used themes-recruited soldiers to both fight\noff Arab sieges of Constantinople and to cement control of Anatolia. By the end of his reign,\nAnatolia was secure from the Arabs and would remain the major part of the Byzantine Empire\nfor centuries.\nIn addition to the themes system, the empire added heavy cavalry to its roster and,\nfamously, used a substance called Greek Fire in naval warfare; there are very few details, but it\n228 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nappears to have been an oil-based incendiary substance used to attack enemy ships. Finally,\nthe empire made liberal use of spies and agents who infiltrated enemy governments and bribed\nor assassinated their targets to disrupt, or to start, wars.\nA medieval illustration of Greek fire.\nIn the Balkans, Slavic tribes proved a major ongoing problem for the Byzantines. A\npeople known as the Avars invaded from the north in the sixth century and raided not just the\nBalkans but all across Europe, making it as far as the newly-created Frankish kingdom in\npresent-day France. In the eighth century an even more ferocious nomadic people, the Bulgars\n(for whom the present-day country of Bulgaria is named), invaded. While the Avars had\nconverted to Christianity during the period of their invasions, the Bulgars remained pagan. They\ndestroyed the remaining Byzantine cities in the northern Balkans, slaughtered or enslaved the\ninhabitants, and crushed Byzantine armies. In one especially colorful moment in Bulgarian\nhistory, the Bulgar Khan, Krum, converted the skull of a slain emperor into a goblet in about 810\nCE to toast his victory over a Byzantine army. Fifty years later, however, another Khan, Boris I,\nconverted to Christianity and opened diplomatic relations with Constantinople.\nThis was an interesting and surprisingly common pattern: many \"barbarian\" peoples and\nkingdoms willingly converted to Christianity rather than having Christianity imposed on them\nthrough force. The Bulgars were consistently able to defeat Byzantine armies and they\noccupied territory seized from the Byzantine Empire, yet Boris I chose to convert (and to insist\n229 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthat his followers do as well). The major reason for this deliberate conversion revolved around\nthe desire on the part of barbarian kings to, simply, stop being barbarians. Most kings\nrecognized that Christianity was a prerequisite to entering into trade and diplomatic relations\nwith Byzantium and the Christian kingdoms of the west. Once a kingdom converted, it could\nconsider itself a member of the network of civilized societies, carry out alliances and trade with\nother kingdoms, and receive official recognition from the emperor (who still wielded considerable\nprestige and authority, even outside of the areas of direct Byzantine control).\nAn important figure in the history of eastern Christianity was St. Cyril, who in the ninth\ncentury created an alphabet for the Slavic languages, now called Cyrillic and still used in many\nSlavic languages including Russian. He then translated Greek liturgy into Slavonic and used it\nto teach and convert the inhabitants of Moravia and Bulgaria. Monasteries sprung up, from\nwhich monks would go further into Slavic lands, ultimately tying together a swath of territory\ndeep into what would one day be Russia. The success of these missionary efforts united much\nof Eastern Europe and Byzantium in a common religious culture - that of Eastern Orthodoxy.\nThus, up to the present, the Greek, Russian, Ukrainian, and Serbian Orthodox churches all\nshare common historical roots and a common set of beliefs and practices.\nThe origins of Russia emerged out of this interaction, and out of the relationship between\nByzantium and the Viking kings of the Slavs in Russia. Originally, the \u201cRus\u201d were Vikings who\nruled small cities in the vast steppes and forests of western Russia and the Ukraine. They were\nunited in about 980 CE by a king, Vladimir the Great, who conquered all of the rival cities and\nimposed control from his capital in Kiev. He converted to Orthodox Christianity and forbade his\nsubjects to continue worshiping Odin, Thor, and the other Norse gods. Just as Boris of Bulgaria\nhad a century earlier, Vladimir used conversion to legitimize his own rule, by connecting his\nnascent kingdom to the prestige, power, and glory of ancient Rome embodied in the Byzantine\nEmpire.\nThe City and the Emperors\nA major factor in the success of Orthodox conversion among the Slavic peoples of\nEastern Europe was the splendor of Constantinople itself. Numerous accounts survive of the\nsheer impact Constantinople\u2019s size, prosperity, and beauty had on visitors. Constantinople was\nsimply the largest, richest, and most glorious city in Europe and the Mediterranean region at the\ntime. It enjoyed a cash economy, impregnable defensive fortifications, and abundant food\nthanks to the availability of Anatolian grain and fish from the Aegean Sea. Silkworms were\n230 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nsmuggled out of China in roughly 550, at which point Constantinople became the heart of a\nEuropean silk industry, an imperial monopoly which generated tremendous wealth. The entire\neconomy was regulated by the imperial government through a system of guilds, which helped\nensure steady tax revenues.\nConstantinople was impregnable for centuries. Strong walls protected it in the west, and it was\nsurrounded by cliffs leading down to the sea (and its ports) on all of the other sides.\nMeanwhile, in the heart of the empire, the emperor held absolute authority. A complex\nand formal ranking system of nobles and courtiers, clothed in garments dyed specific colors to\ndenote their respective ranks, separated the person of the emperor from supplicants and\nambassadors. This was not just self-indulgence on the part of the emperors, or showing off for\nthe sake of feeling important; this was part of the symbolism of power, of reaching out to a\nlargely illiterate population with visible displays of authority.\nThe imperial bureaucracy held enormous power in Byzantium. Provincial elites would\nsend their sons to Constantinople to study and obtain positions. Bribery was rife and nepotism\nwas as common as talent in gaining positions; there was even an official list of maximum bribes\n231 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthat was published by the government itself. That said, the bureaucracy was somewhat like the\nancient Egyptian class of scribes, men who maintained coherence and order within the\ngovernment even when individual emperors were incompetent or palace intrigue rendered an\nemperor unable to focus on governance.\nThe imperial office controlled the minting of coins, still the standard currency as far away\nas France and England because the coins were reliably weighted and backed by the imperial\ngovernment. The emperor's office also controlled imperial monopolies on key industries like\nsilk, which were hugely lucrative. It was illegal to try to compete with the imperial silk industry,\nso enormous profits were directed straight into the royal treasury.\nConstantinople had as many as a million people in the late eighth century (as compared\nto no more than 15,000 in any \u201ccity\u201d in western Europe), but there were many other rich cities\nwithin its empire. As a whole, Byzantium traded its high-quality finished goods to western\nEurope in return for raw materials like ore and foodstuffs. Despite its wars with its neighbors to\nthe east and south, Byzantium also had major trade links with the Arab states.\nOrthodox Christianity and Learning\nTo return to Orthodox Christianity, it was not just because Constantinople was at the\ncenter of the empire that Byzantines thought it had a special relationship with God. Its power\nwas derived from the sheer number of churches and relics present in the city, which in turn\nrepresented an enormous amount of potentia (holy power). Byzantines believed that God\noversaw Constantinople and that the Virgin Mary interceded before God on the behalf of the\ncity. Many priests taught that Constantinople was the New Jerusalem that would be at the\ncenter of events during the second coming of Christ, rather than the actual Jerusalem.\nThe piety of the empire sometimes undermined secular learning, however. Over time,\nthe church grew increasingly suspicious of learning that did not have either center on the Bible\nand religious instruction or have direct practical applications in crafts or engineering. Thus,\nthere was a marked decline in scholarship throughout the empire. Eventually, the whole body of\nancient Greek learning was concentrated in a small academic elite in Constantinople and a few\nother important Greek cities. What was later regarded as the founding body of thought of\nWestern Civilization - ancient Greek philosophy and literature - was thus largely analyzed,\ntranslated, and recopied outside of Greece itself in the Arab kingdoms of the Middle Ages.\nLikewise, almost no one in Byzantium understood Latin well by the ninth century, so even\nJustinian\u2019s law code was almost always referenced in a simplified Greek translation.\n232 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThis was a period in which, in both the Arab kingdoms and in Byzantium, there was a\nbewildering mixture of language, place of origin, and religious affiliation. For example, a\nChristian in Syria, a subject of the Muslim Arab kingdoms by the eighth century, would be\nunable to speak to a Byzantine Christian, nor would she be welcomed in Constantinople since\nshe was probably a Monophysite Christian (one of the many Christian heresies, at least from\nthe Orthodox perspective) instead of an Orthodox one. Likewise, men in her family might find\nthemselves enlisted to fight against Byzantium despite their Christian faith, with political\nallegiances outweighing religious ones.\nIconoclasm\nOne of the greatest religious controversies in the history of Christianity was iconoclasm,\nthe breaking or destroying of icons. Iconoclasm was one of those phenomena that may seem\nalmost ridiculously trivial in historical hindsight, but it had an enormous (and almost entirely\nnegative) impact at the time. For people who believed in the constant intervention of God in the\nsmallest of things, iconoclasm was an enormously important issue.\nThe conundrum that prompted iconoclasm was simple: if Byzantium was the holiest of\nstates, watched over by the Virgin Mary and ruled by emperors who were the \u201cbeloved of God,\u201d\nwhy was the empire declining? Just as Rome had fallen in the west, Byzantium was beset by\nenemies all around it, enemies who had the depressing tendency of crushing Byzantine armies\nand occasionally murdering its emperors. Byzantine priests repeatedly warned their\ncongregations to repent of their sins, because it was sin that was undermining the empire's\nsurvival. The emperor Leo III, who ruled from 717 \u2013 741, decided to take action into his own\nhands. He forced communities of Jews in the empire to convert to Christianity, convinced that\ntheir presence was somehow angering God. He then went on to do something much more\nunprecedented than persecuting Jews: attacking icons.\nIcons were (and are) one of the central aspects of Eastern Orthodox Christian worship.\nAn icon is an image of a holy figure, almost always Christ, the Virgin Mary, or one of the saints,\nthat is used as a focus of Christian worship both in churches and in homes. Byzantine icons\nwere beautifully crafted and, in a largely illiterate society, were vitally important in the daily\nexperience of most Christians. The problem was that it was a slippery slope from venerating\nGod, Christ, and the saints through icons as symbols, versus actually worshiping the icons\nthemselves as idols, something expressly forbidden in the Old Testament. Frankly, there is no\n233 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nquestion that thousands of believers did treat the icons as idols, as objects with potentia unto\nthemselves, like relics.\nA fourteenth-century icon of the Virgin Mary.\nIn 726, a volcano devastated the island of Santorini in the Aegean sea. Leo III took this\nas proof that icon veneration had gone too far, as some of his religious advisers had been telling\nhim. He thus ordered the destruction of holy images, facing outright riots when workers tried to\nmake good on his proclamation by removing icons of Christ affixed to the imperial palace. In the\nprovinces, whole regions rose up in revolt when royal servants showed up and tried to destroy\nicons. In Rome, Pope Gregory II was appalled and excommunicated Leo. Leo, in turn,\ndeclared that the pope no longer had any religious authority in the empire, which for practical\npurposes meant the regions under Byzantine control in Italy, Sicily, and the Balkans.\nThe official ban of icons lasted until 843, over a century, before the emperors reversed it\n(it was an empress, named Theodora like the famous wife of Justinian centuries earlier, who led\n234 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthe charge to officially restore icons). The controversy weakened the empire by dividing it\nbetween iconoclasts loyal to the official policy of the emperors and traditionalists who venerated\nthe icons, while the empire itself was still beset by invasions. Iconoclasm also lent itself to what\nwould eventually become a permanent split between the eastern and western churches -\nOrthodoxy and Catholicism. The final and permanent split between the western and eastern\nchurches, already de facto in place for centuries, was in 1054, when Pope Leo IX and Patriarch\nMichael I excommunicated each other after Michael refused to acknowledge Leo\u2019s preeminence\n\u2013 this event cemented the \"Great Schism\" (schism means \"break\" or \"split\") between the\nwestern and eastern churches.\nIn the wake of iconoclasm, the leaders of the Orthodox Church, the patriarchs of\nConstantinople, would claim that innovations in theology or Christian practice were heresies.\nThis attitude extended to secular learning as well \u2013 it was acceptable to study classical literature\nand even philosophy, but new forms of philosophy and scholarly innovation were regarded as\ndangerous. The long-term pattern was thus that, while it preserved ancient learning, Byzantine\nintellectual culture did not lend itself to progress.\nThe Late Golden Age and the Final Decline\nByzantium\u2019s last period of strength was under a Macedonian dynasty, lasting from 867 \u2013\n1056. A murderous leader named Basil I, originating from Macedonia, seized the throne in 867\nand initiated a line of ruthless but competent leaders who governed for about two hundred\nyears. Under the Macedonians, Byzantine territorial lines were pushed back to part of\nMesopotamia and Armenia in the east and Crete and Cyprus in the Mediterranean. The\nimportant effect of these reconquests was trade; once again, Byzantium was at the center of an\ninternational trade network stretching across Europe and the Middle East. This vastly enriched\nConstantinople and its region, leading to a renaissance in building and art. Under the patronage\nof the Macedonian dynasty, some ancient learning was revived, as scholars tried to find ways to\nmake the work of the ancient Greek masters compatible with Orthodox Christian teachings.\nDuring this late golden age, Constantinople\u2019s population rebounded, with food supplies\nguaranteed by the imperial government. Even the poor lived better lives in Constantinople than\ndid the relatively well-off in Western Europe, much of which was barbaric by comparison. An\nelite class of administrators occupied a social position somewhat like the ancient Egyptian\nscribes and were educated in Christianized versions of Greek learning and classics; one scholar\n235 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nnamed Photius produced an encyclopedia of ancient Greek writings that is the only record of\nmany texts that would have been otherwise permanently lost.\nByzantium in its late golden age - note that Constantinople remained both geographically and\npolitically central.\nThese happy times for Byzantium ended when the emperor Basil II died in 1025 with no\nmale heir. Simultaneously, a series of bad harvests hit the empire. Byzantium's military\nsuccess was based on the themes, which were in turn based on the existence of reasonably\nprosperous independent farmers. Bad harvests saw those farmers vanish, their lands\nswallowed up by the holdings of wealthy aristocrats. As had happened in the Roman Republic\nso long ago, the problem was that there were thus no soldiers to recruit, and the armies shrank.\nLikewise, the relative calm of the Macedonian period ended with the rise of a new group\nof invaders from the east: the Seljuk Turks. A powerful group of nomadic raiders from the\nwestern part of Central Asia, the Turks had converted to Islam centuries earlier. Despite having\nno centralized leadership (the Seljuks themselves were just one of the dominant clans with no\nreal authority over most of their fellow raiders), by about the year 1000 CE they began invading\nboth Byzantine territories and those of their fellow Muslims, the Arabs. Over the next few\ncenturies, the Turks grew in power, steadily encroaching on Byzantium's territories in Anatolia.\nFewer independent citizens meant fewer good soldiers, and the armies of Byzantium\nthus became dominated by foreign mercenaries paid out of the imperial treasury, representing\n236 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nan enormous financial burden for the empire. Another disaster occurred in 1199 when\nConstantinople itself was invaded and sacked by crusaders (during the Fourth Crusade) from\nWestern Europe who were supposed to be sailing to fight in the Holy Land. For about fifty\nyears, Byzantium (already reduced to a fraction of its former size) was ruled by a Catholic king.\nEven when the king was deposed and a Greek dynasty restored, nothing could be done to\nrecapture lost territory. The Muslim empires that surrounded Byzantium occupied its territory\nuntil Constantinople finally fell in 1453 to the Ottoman Turks. With it, the last vestige of Roman\ncivilization, founded over two thousand years earlier on the banks of the Tiber River in Italy,\nceased to exist as a political reality.\nImage Citations (Wikimedia Commons):\nEastern and Western Empire Map - Pixeltoo\nJustinian Mosaic - Bender235\nGreek Fire - Public Domain\nMap of Constantinople - Cplakidas\nVirgin Mary Icon - Public Domain\nLate Golden Age - Cplakidas\n237 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nChapter 12: Islam and The Caliphates\nThe history of Islam is an integral part of the history of Western Civilization. Consider\nthe following:\n1. Islam was born in the heartland of Western Civilization: the Middle East.\n2. Islam is a religion of precisely the same religious tradition as Judaism and Christianity.\nIn Islam, the prophets that came before Muhammad, from Abraham and Moses to Jesus,\nare venerated as genuine messengers of God. The distinction is that, for Muslims,\nMuhammad was the last prophet, bringing the \"definitive version\" of God's message to\nhumanity. The word Allah simply means \u201cGod\u201d in Arabic - He is the same God\nworshiped by Jews and Christians.\n3. The Islamic empires were the most advanced in the world, alongside China, during the\nEuropean Middle Ages. During that period, they created and preserved all important\nscholarship worthy of the name. As noted in the previous chapter, it was Arab\nscholarship that preserved ancient Greek learning, and Arab scholars were responsible\nfor numerous technological and scientific discoveries as well.\n4. The Islamic empires were often the enemies of various Christian ones. They were\ncertainly the target of the European crusades. But, at the same time, the Christian\nkingdoms were often the enemies of one another as well. Likewise, different Islamic\nstates were often in conflict. The political, and military, history of medieval Europe and\nthe Middle East is one of different political entities both warring and trading; religion was\ncertainly a major factor, but there are many cases where it was secondary to more\nprosaic economic or political concerns.\n5. The Islamic states were the active trading partners and sometimes allies of their\nneighbors from India and Central Asia to Africa and Europe. Islam's initial spread was\ndue to an enormous, unprecedented military campaign, but after that campaign ended\nthe resulting empires and kingdoms entered into a more familiar economic and\ndiplomatic relationship with their respective neighbors.\n238 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThus, it is important to include the story of Islam as an inherent, intrinsic part of the\nhistory of Western Civilization, not the religious bogeyman Medieval Europeans sometimes\nimagined it to be. That being noted, it is not just medieval prejudices or contemporary\ngeopolitical conflict that has created the conceit that Islam is some alien entity to Western\nCivilization. After the rise of Christianity and the conversion of the Roman Empire, the idea of a\nsingle, unified empire of Christianity, \u201cChristendom\u201d became central to the identity of Christians\nin Europe. Once Rome itself fell, this idea became even more important. The Germanic\nKingdoms, what was left of the western empire, the new rising empires like the Kievan Rus, and\nof course Byzantium were all linked in the concept of Christendom. For many of those Christian\nstates, Islam was indeed the enemy, because the rise of Islam coincided with one of the most\nextraordinary series of military conquests in world history: the Arab conquests.\nThus, from its very beginning, there have been historical reasons that Christians and\nMuslims sometimes considered themselves enemies. The first generations of Muslims did\nindeed try to conquer every culture and kingdom they encountered, although not initially in the\nname of conversion. The important thing to bear in mind, however, is that throughout the Middle\nAges many of the struggles between Christian and Muslim kingdoms, and Christian and Muslim\npeople, were as often about conventional battles over power, wealth, and politics as religious\nbelief. Likewise, once the years of conquest were over, Islamic states settled into familiar\npatterns of peaceful trade and they contained religiously diverse populations.\nOrigins of Islam\nThe pre-Islamic Arabian peninsula, most of which is today the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\nwas populated by the Arab people. The Arabs were herders and merchants. They were\norganized in clans, with each clan claiming descent from common ancestors and governing\nthrough meetings of the patriarchs of the leading families. The Arabs were well known in the\nRoman and Byzantine world as merchants for their camel caravans that linked Europe to a part\nof the Spice Road, transporting goods from India and China. They were also known to be some\nof the most fierce and effective mercenary warriors in the eastern Mediterranean region; they\nrode slim, fast, agile horses and fought as light cavalry.\nArab trade, and population, was concentrated in the more fertile southern and western\nregions, especially in what is today the country of Yemen. By the late Roman Empire, small but\nprosperous Arab kingdoms were in diplomatic contact with both Rome and Persia (as well as\nthe Christian kingdom of Ethiopia, then called Aksum). As the wars between Rome and Persia\n239 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nbecame even more destructive after the Sasanian takeover in 234 CE, the Arabs emerged as\nimportant mercenaries and political clients for both empires. Persia in particular invested\nheavily in employing Arab soldiers and in cultivating the maritime trade route across the Indian\nOcean and along the south and west coasts of Arabia. For a time, the southern coast of Arabia\nwas ruled by Persia through Arab clients and Persia was clearly a major cultural influence (so\ngreat was the renown of the Persian Great King Khusrau that his name became the root of an\nArabic word for king: kisra). This contact and trade enriched the Arabic economy and led to a\nhigh degree of tactical sophistication among Arab soldiers.\nArabia in 600 CE. The names in black on the map are the clan groups at the time.\nMecca is spelled \u201cMakkah,\u201d with Yathrib to its north.\nThe Arabs were polytheists - they worshiped a variety of gods linked to various oases in\nthe desert. One important holy site that would take on even greater importance after the rise of\nIslam was the city of Mecca. Mecca had been a major center of trade for centuries, lying at the\nintersection of trade routes and near oases. In the center of Mecca was a shrine, called the\nKa\u2019aba, built around a piece of volcanic rock worshiped as a holy object in various Arabic faiths,\nand Mecca was a major pilgrimage site for the Arabs well before Islam.\n240 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nMuhammad\nEverything changed in the Arab world in the sixth century CE. A man named\nMuhammad was born in 570 CE to a powerful clan of merchants, the Quraysh, who controlled\nvarious trade enterprises in Mecca and surrounding cities. He grew up to be a merchant,\nmarrying a wealthy and intelligent widow named Khadija (who was originally his employer) and\ntraveling with caravans. He was particularly well known as a fair and perceptive arbitrator of\ndisputes among other Arab clans and merchants. He traveled widely on business, dealing with\nboth Christians and Jews in Palestine and Syria, where he learned about their respective\nreligions.\nAn introspective man who detested greed and corruption, Muhammad was in the habit of\nretreating to the hills near Mecca, where there was a cave in which he would camp and\nmeditate. When he was about forty, he returned to Mecca and reported that he had been\ncontacted by the archangel Gabriel, who informed him that he, Muhammad, was to bear God's\nmessage to the people of Mecca and the world. The core of that message was that the one true\nGod, the God of Abraham, venerated already by the Jews and Christians, had called the Arabs\nto cast aside their idols and unite in a community of worshipers.\nMuhammad did not meet with much success in Mecca in his initial preaching. The\ntemples of the many gods there were rich and powerful and people resented Muhammad's\nattempts to get them to convert to his new religion, in large part because he was asking them to\ncast aside centuries of religious tradition. The real issue with Muhammad's message was its\ncall for exclusivity \u2013 if Muhammad had just asked the Meccans to venerate the God of Abraham\nin addition to their existing deities, it probably would not have incited such fierce resistance,\nespecially from the clan leaders who dominated Meccan society. Those clan leaders were\nfearful that if Muhammad's message caught on, it would threaten the pilgrims who flocked to\nMecca to venerate the various deities: that would be bad for business.\nThus, in 622 CE, Muhammad and a group of his followers left Mecca, exiled by the\npowerful families that were part of Muhammad\u2019s own extended clan, and traveled to the city of\nYathrib, which Muhammad later renamed Medina (\u201cthe city of the Prophet\u201d), 200 miles north.\nThey were welcomed there by the people of Medina who hoped that Muhammad could serve as\nan impartial mediator in the frequent disputes between clans and families. Muhammad\u2019s trek to\nMedina is called the Hejira (also spelled Hijra in English) and is the starting date of the Islamic\ncalendar.\n241 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nIn Medina, Muhammad met with much more success in winning converts. He quickly\nestablished a religious community with himself as the leader, one that made no distinction\nbetween religious and political authority. His followers would regularly gather to hear him recite\nthe Koran, which means \u201crecitations\": the repeated words of God Himself as spoken to\nMuhammad by the angel. In 624, just two years after his arrival in Medina, Muhammad led a\nMuslim force against a Meccan army, and then in 630 CE, he conquered Mecca, largely by\nskillfully negotiating with his former enemies there \u2013 he promised to make Mecca the center of\nIslam, to require pilgrimage, and to incorporate it into his growing kingdom. He sent\nmissionaries and soldiers across Arabia, as well as to foreign powers like Byzantium and Persia.\nBy his death in 632, Muhammad had already rallied most of the Arab clans under his leadership\nand most willingly converted to Islam.\nIslam\nThe word Islam means \u201csubmission.\u201d Its central tenet is submission before the will of\nGod, as revealed to humanity by Muhammad. An aspect of Islam that distinguishes it from\nJudaism and Christianity is that the Koran has a single point of origin, the recitations of\nMuhammad himself, and it is believed by Muslims that it cannot be translated from Arabic and\nremain the \"real\" holy book. In other words, translations can be made for the sake of education,\nbut every word in the Koran, spoken in the classical Arabic of Muhammad's day, is believed to\nbe that true language of God - according to traditional Islamic belief, the angels speak Arabic in\nparadise.\nAccording to Islam, Muhammad was the last in the line of prophets stretching back to\nAbraham and Moses and including Jesus, whom Muslims consider a major prophet and a\nreligious leader, but not actually divine. Muhammad delivered the \u201cdefinitive version\u201d of God's\nwill as it was told to him by Gabriel on the mountainside. The core tenets of Islamic belief are\nreferred to as the \"five pillars\":\n1. There is only one God and Muhammad is his prophet.\n2. Each Muslim must pray five times a day, facing toward the holy city of Mecca.\n3. During the holy month of Ramadan, each Muslim must fast from dawn to sundown.\n4. Charity should be given to the needy.\n5. If possible, at least once in his or her life, each Muslim should undertake the Haaj: the\npilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca.\n242 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nIn turn, a central concept of Islam is that of the worldwide community of Muslims, the\nUmmah, meaning \"community of believers.\" The Ummah was a central idea from the lifetime of\nMuhammad onward, referring to a shared identity among Muslims that is supposed to transcend\ndifferences of language, ethnicity, and culture. All Muslims are to follow the five pillars, just as\nall Muslims are to meet other members of the Ummah at least once in their lives while on\npilgrimage.\nThe Ka\u2019aba (contemporary photograph).\nOne term associated with Islam, Jihad, has sparked widespread misunderstanding\namong non-Muslims. The word itself simply means \"struggle.\" It does mean \u201choly war\u201d in some\ncases, but not in most. The concept of Jihad revolves around the struggle for Muslims to live\naccording to Muhammad's example and by his teachings. Its most common use is the \u201cjihad of\nthe heart,\u201d of struggling to live morally against the myriad corrupting temptations of life.\nThe Koran itself was written down starting during Muhammad\u2019s life (his revelations were\ndelivered over the course of about twenty years, and were initially transmitted orally). The\ndefinitive version was completed in the years following his death. Of secondary importance to\n243 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthe Koran is the Hadith, a collection of stories about Muhammad\u2019s life, behavior, and sayings, all\nof which provided a model of a righteous and ethical life. In turn, in the generations following his\ndeath, Muslim leaders created the Sharia, the system of Islamic law based on the Koran and\nHadith.\nThe Political History of the Arabs After Muhammad\nWhen Muhammad died, there were immediate problems among the Muslim Arabs. He\ndid not name a successor, but he had been the definitive leader of the Islamic community during\nhis life; it seemed clear that the community was meant to have a leader. The Muslim elders\nappointed Muhammad's father in-law, Abu Bakr (r. 632 \u2013 634), as the new leader after a period\nof deliberation. He became the first Caliph, meaning \"successor\": the head of the Ummah, the\nman who represented both spiritual and political authority to Muslims.\nUnder Abu Bakr and his successors, Umar (another of Muhammad\u2019s fathers in-law; r.\n634 - 644), and Uthman (r. 644 \u2013 655), Muslim armies expanded rapidly. This began as a\nmeans to ensure the loyalty of the fractious Arab clans as much as to expand the faith; both Abu\nBakur and Umar were forced to suppress revolts of the clans, and Umar hit upon the idea of\nraiding Persia and Byzantium to keep the them loyal. For the first time in history, the Arabs\nembarked on a sustained campaign of conquest rather than serving others as mercenaries.\nRiding their swift horses and camels and devoted to their cause, the Arab armies\nconquered huge amounts of territory extremely rapidly. It was the Arab army that finally\nconquered Persia in 637 (although it took until 650 for all Persian resistance to be vanquished),\nthat hitherto-unconquered adversary of Rome. The Arabs conquered Syria and seized\nByzantine territory in Anatolia equally quickly: Egypt was conquered by 642, with an attempted\nByzantine counter-attack fought off in 645. Within twenty years of the death of Muhammad, the\nheartland of the Middle East was firmly in Arab Muslim hands.\nPart of the success of the first decades of the Arab conquests was because of the\nvulnerability of Byzantium and Persia at the time, and another part was the tactical skill of Arab\nsoldiers. The Arabs conquered Persia not just because it was weakened by its wars with\nByzantium (most importantly its defeat by Heraclius in 627), but because many Arab clans had\nfought as mercenaries for both sides in the conflict. Great wealth had been flowing into Arabia\nfor decades, and the Arabs were already veteran soldiers. They had learned both Roman and\nPersian tactics and strategy and they were skilled at siegecraft, intelligence-gathering, and open\nbattle alike.\n244 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Arab armies were easily the match of the Byzantine and Persian forces. The Arabs\nwere able to field armies of about 20,000 \u2013 30,000 men, with a total force of closer to 200,000\nby about 700 CE. Most were Arabs from Arabia itself, along with Arabs who had settled in Syria\nand Palestine and were then recruited. A smaller percentage were non-Arabs who converted\nand joined the armies. Tactically, the majority were infantry who fought with spears and swords\nand were lightly-armored.\nThe major tactical advantage of the Arab armies was their speed: horses and camels\nwere important less as animals to fight from than as means of transportation for the\nlightly-armored and equipped armies. Soldiers were paid in coins captured as booty and whole\narmies were expected to buy their supplies as they marched rather than relying on heavy\nbaggage trains. Their conquests were a kind of sustained sprint as a result. Likewise, one\nspecific military \"technology\" that the Arabs used to great effect was camels, since no other\nculture was as adept at training and using camels as were the Arabs. Camels allowed the Arab\narmies to cross deserts and launch sudden attacks on their enemies, often catching them by\nsurprise.\nFinally, especially in Byzantine territories, high taxes and ongoing struggles between the\nofficial Orthodox form of Christianity and various other Christian sects led many Byzantine\ncitizens to welcome their new Arab rulers; taxes often went down, and the Arabs were indifferent\nto which variety of Christianity their new subjects happened to subscribe to. In addition, the\nArabs made little effort to convert non-Arabs to Islam for several generations after the initial\nconquests. To be clear, there was plenty of bloodshed during the Arab conquests, including the\ndeaths of many civilians, but the long-term experience of Arab rule in former Byzantine\nterritories was no more, and probably less, oppressive than it had been under Byzantium.\nThe Umayyad Caliphate and the Shia\nThe second caliph, Umar, was murdered by a slave in 644 and the Muslim leaders had\nto pick the next caliph. They chose an early convert and companion of Muhammad, Uthman.\nMany members of the Muslim community, however, supported Muhammad's cousin and son\nin-law Ali, claiming he should be the head of the Ummah, as someone who was part of\nMuhammad's direct family line. That group was known as the \u201cparty\u201d or \u201cfaction\u201d of Ali: the Shia\nof Ali (note that Shia is also frequently spelled \u201cShi\u2019ite\u201d in English). For Shia Muslims, the\ncentral idea was that only descendants of Muhammad should lead the Ummah. The majority of\nMuslims, known as Sunnis (\u201ctraditionalists\u201d), however, argued that any sufficiently righteous and\ncompetent leader could be appointed caliph.\n245 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nWhile the Shia rejected Uthman\u2019s authority in theory, there was as yet no outright\nviolence between the two factions within the larger Muslim community. In 656 Uthman died, the\nvictim of a short-lived Egyptian rebellion against the Arabs. Ali was elected as the next caliph,\nseemingly ending the dispute over who should lead the Ummah. Unfortunately for Muslim unity,\nhowever, a significant number of Arab leaders disagreed with Ali\u2019s policies and chose to support\na rival would-be caliph, a relative of Uthman named Mu\u2019awiya, a member of the Umayyad clan\ngoverning Syria. Ali was murdered by a rebel (unrelated to the power struggle over the\ncaliphate) in 661, cementing the Umayyad claim on power, but not resolving the doctrinal\ndispute between Shia and Sunni.\nIt was thus under the leadership of caliphs who were not themselves related to\nMuhammad\u2019s family line that the Arab conquests not only continued, but stabilized in the form of\na true empire. The Umayyad clan created the first long-lasting and stable Muslim state: the\nUmayyad Caliphate. It was centered in Syria and lasted almost 100 years. It supervised the\nconsolidation of the gains of the Arab armies to date, along with vast new conquests in North\nAfrica and Spain. The Umayyads were capable administrators and skilled generals and the\nmajority of Muslims saw the Umayyad rulers as the legitimate caliphs.\nWhat they could not do, however, was destroy the Shia, despite Ali's death. Shia\nMuslims, representing about 10% of the population of the Ummah (then and now), viewed the\nUmayyad government as fundamentally illegitimate, rejecting the very idea of a caliphate and\narguing instead that the faithful should be led by an Imam: a direct biological and spiritual\ndescendant of Muhammad\u2019s family. When Ali\u2019s son Hussein, then the leader of the Shia and a\ngrandson of Muhammad himself, was killed by the Umayyads in 680, the permanent breach\nbetween Sunni and Shia was cemented.\nBy 700 CE, the Umayyads had conquered all of North Africa as far as the Atlantic.\nThen, in 711, they invaded Spain and smashed the Visigothic kingdom, definitively ending Arian\nChristianity across both North Africa and Spain. They were finally stopped in 732 by a Frankish\narmy led by the Frankish lord Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers, which marked the end of\nthe Arab conquests in Europe. Likewise, despite conquering large amounts of Byzantine\nterritory, Constantinople itself withstood a huge siege in 718 and Byzantine forces then pushed\nback Arab forces in Anatolia.\n246 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Arab Conquests, stretching from Persia in the east to Morocco and Spain in the\nwest. The colors correspond to chronology: Arabia itself was united under Muhammad and his\nimmediate successors, the regions in orange under the first four caliphs, and the regions in\nyellow under the Umayyads.\nIn Africa, Umayyad armies also attacked Nubia, still one of the richest kingdoms in the\nregion, but were unable to defeat it. For the first time, the caliphate signed a peace treaty with a\nnon-Muslim state. This was an important precedent because it established the idea that a\nMuslim state could acknowledge the political legitimacy of a non-Muslim one. Afterwards, the\nUmayyad Caliphate came to deal with non-Muslim powers primarily in terms of normal\ndiplomacy rather than through the lens of holy war.\nIn 751, Arab forces went so far as to defeat a Chinese army in Central Asia outside of\nthe caravan city of Samarkand (they fought an army of the Tang dynasty, which had been\nexpanding along the Silk Road). The last Umayyad caliph had been murdered shortly before\nthis conflict, however, and the Muslim forces thus had little reason to continue their expansion.\nThis battle marked the furthest extent of the core Muslim-ruled territories. For several centuries\nto follow, the Muslim world thus consisted of the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain.\n247 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Umayyad Government and Society\nThe Umayyads did not just complete and consolidate the conquests of the Arabs. They\nalso established lasting forms of governance. They quickly abandoned the practice of having\nelders come together to appoint leadership, insisting on a hereditary line of caliphs. This alone\ncaused a civil war in the late seventh century, as some of their Muslim subjects rose up,\nclaiming that they had perverted the proper line of leadership in the community. The Umayyads\nwon that war, too.\nThe major problem for the Umayyads was the sheer size of their empire. Just like other\nrapid conquests, such as that of Alexander the Great 1,000 years earlier, in the course of just a\nfew decades a people found itself in control of enormous swaths of territory. The Arabs had a\nstrong linguistic and cultural identity and many of the Arab conquerors saw themselves as a\npeople apart from their new subjects, regardless of religious belief. Thus, while non-Arabs were\ncertainly encouraged to convert to Islam, the power structure of the Caliphate remained\nresolutely Arabic. As with the Greeks under Alexander, the Romans during their centuries of\nconquest, and the Germanic tribes that sliced up the western Roman Empire, the Arabs found\nthemselves a small minority ruling over various other groups.\nTo try to effectively govern this vast new empire, the Umayyads took over and adapted\nthe bureaucracies of the people they conquered, including those of both the Byzantines and,\nespecially, the Persians. They created new borders and provinces to better suit their\nadministration and ensure that tax revenue made it back to the capital at Damascus, with the\nidiosyncratic additional factor of needing to pay an ongoing salary to all Arab soldiers, even after\nthose soldiers had retired.\nOne change that was to last until the present was linguistic. Unlike the Greek case\nduring the Hellenistic period, Arabic was to replace the vernacular of the lands conquered\nduring the Arab conquests. The only exceptions were Persian, which would eventually become\nthe modern language of Farsi (the vernacular of the present-day country of Iran), and Spain,\nwhere Arabic and Spanish coexisted until Christian kingdoms reconquered Spain many\ncenturies later. This linguistic uniformity was a huge benefit to trade, and to cultural and\nintellectual exchange, because one could travel from Spain to India and speak a single\nlanguage.\nArabs also followed the patterns of Greek and Roman conquerors by colonizing the\nplaces they conquered. At first, they settled in garrison and administrative towns, but they also\nset up communities within conquered cities. As Arabic became the language of daily life, not\n248 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\njust of administration, Arabs and non-Arabs mixed more readily. Arabs also built new cities all\nacross their empire, the most notable being a small town in Egypt that would eventually grow\ninto Cairo. They built these cities on the Hellenistic and Roman model: planned grids of streets\nat right angles. In the center of each city was the mosque, which served not only as the center\nof worship, but in various other functions. Mosques were both figuratively and literally central to\nthe cities of the Umayyad caliphate. They were the predominant public spaces for discussion\namong men. They were the courthouses and the banks. They provided schooling and\ninstruction. They were also often attached to administrative offices and governmental functions.\nThe Umayyads may have disrupted the traditional oral transmission of literatures by the peoples\nof their empire, but the mosques fostered a blossoming manuscript culture that would overlap\nwith the oral one, laying the groundwork for what would become a remarkably literate society\nThe Umayyads imposed taxes across their entire empire, even insisting that their fellow\nArabs pay a tax on their land, which was met with enormous resistance because, to Arabs\nunused to paying taxes at all, it implied subordination. By channeling taxes through their new,\nefficient bureaucracy, the Umayyads were able to support a very large standing army. That\nallowed them not only to keep up the pressure on surrounding lands, but to quash rebellions.\nThe Umayyads supervised a tremendous expansion in trade and commerce across the\nMiddle East and North Africa as well. Muhammad had been a merchant, after all, and the\nlongstanding commercial practices and regulations of Arabic society were codified in Sharia law\n- in that sense, commercial law was directly linked to religious righteousness. Likewise, even\nfrom this early period, the caliphate supported maritime trade networks. Muslim traders\nregularly sailed all across the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and eventually\nas far as China and the Philippines. In waters controlled by the caliphate, piracy was contained,\nso trade prospered even more.\nOne effect of Arab seafaring is that Islam spread along sea routes well beyond the\npolitical control of any of the Arab empires and kingdoms to come; today the single largest\npredominantly Muslim country is Indonesia, thanks to Muslim merchants that brought their faith\nalong the trade routes. By the time European explorers began to establish permanent ties to\nAsian kingdoms and empires in the sixteenth century, Islam was established in various regions\nfrom India to the Pacific, thousands of miles from its Middle Eastern heartland.\nOther Faiths\nOne of the noteworthy aspects of the Arab conquests is the complex role of conversion.\nThe Koran specifically forbids the forcible conversion of Jews and Christians. It does allow that\n249 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nnon-Muslim monotheists pay a special tax, however. For the century of Umayyad rule, only\nabout 10% of the population was Muslim. Non-Muslims, called dhimmis (followers of religions\ntolerated by law) had to pay a head tax and were not allowed to share in governmental\ndecision-making or in the spoils of war. Many Jews and Christians found Arab rule preferable to\nByzantine rule, however, because the Byzantine government had actively persecuted religious\ndissenters and the Arabs did not. Likewise, taxes were lower under the Arabs as compared to\nByzantium. These traditions of relative tolerance would continue all the way up to the modern\nera in places like the Ottoman Empire. However, even without forcible pressure, many people\ndid convert to Islam either out of a heartfelt attraction to Islam or because of simple pragmatism;\nin some cases, Muslim generals rejected the attempted conversions of local people because it\nthreatened their tax base so much.\nThere was also the case of the nomadic peoples of North Africa, collectively referred to\nas \u201cBerbers\u201d by the Arabs. The Berbers were hardy, warlike tribesmen living in rugged\nmountainous regions across North Africa. They had already seen the Romans and the Vandals\ncome and go and simply kept up their traditions with the arrival of the Arabs. They were,\nhowever, polytheists, which the Muslims were unwilling to tolerate. Thus, faced with the choice\nof forcible conversion or death, the Berbers converted and then promptly joined the Arab armies\nas auxiliaries. This lent tremendous strength to the Arab forces and helps explain the relative\nease of their conquests, especially in Spain.\nThe members of other monotheistic faiths who chose not to convert were often left much\nmore free to practice their religions than they would have been in Christian lands, because the\nUmayyads simply did not care about theological disagreements among their Jewish and\nChristian subjects so long as the taxes were paid. Over time, various sects of Christianity\nsurvived in Muslim lands that vanished in kingdoms that were officially, and rigidly, Christian.\nLikewise, Jews found that they were generally better off in Muslim lands than in Christian\nkingdoms because of their safety from official persecution. Jews became vitally important\nmerchants, scholars, bankers, and traders all across the caliphate.\nZoroastrianism, however, declined in the long run. The first generations of Muslim rulers\naccepted Zoroastrians as People of the Book like Jews and Christians, but that acceptance\natrophied over time. Muslims were less tolerant of Zoroastrianism because it did not venerate\nthe God of Abraham and its traditions were markedly different from those of Judaism and\nChristianity. Likewise, as Muslim rule over Persia was consolidated over time, the practical\nnecessity of respecting Zoroastrianism as the majority religion of the Persian people weakened.\n250 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nBy the tenth century, most Zoroastrians who had not converted to Islam migrated to India, where\nthey remain today in communities known as the Parsees.\nThe Abbasids\nThe Umayyads fell from power in 750 because of a revolutionary uprising against their\nrule led by the Abbasids, a clan descended from Muhammad's uncle. The Abbasids were\nsupported by many non-Arab but Muslim subjects of the Caliphate (called mawali) who resented\nthe fact that the Umayyads had always protected the status of Arabs at the expense of\nnon-Arab Muslims in their empire. After seizing control of the Caliphate, the Abbasids went on a\nconcerted murdering spree, trying to eliminate all potential Umayyad competitors, with only a\nsingle member of the Umayyad leadership surviving. The Abbasids lost control of some of the\nterritories that had been held by the Umayyads (starting with Spain, which formed its own\ncaliphate under the surviving Umayyad), but the majority of the lands conquered in the Arab\nconquests a century earlier remained in their control.\nThe true golden age of medieval Islam took place during the Abbasid Caliphate. The\nAbbasids moved the capital of the caliphate from Damascus to Baghdad, which they founded in\npart to be nearer to the heart of Persian governmental traditions. There, they combined Islam\neven more closely with Persian traditions of art and learning. They also created a tradition of\nfair rulership, in contrast to the memory of Umayyad corruption. The Abbasid caliphs were the\nleaders of both the political and spiritual orders of their society, seeking to make sure everything\nfrom law to trade to religious practice was running smoothly and fairly. They enforced fair trade\npractices and used their well-trained armies primarily to ensure good trade routes, to enforce\nfair tax collection, and to put down the occasional rebellion. The Abbasid rulers represented, in\nshort, a kind of enlightened despotism that was greatly ahead of Byzantium or the Latin\nkingdoms of Europe in terms of its cosmopolitanism. The Abbasids abandoned Arab-centric\npolicies and instead adopted Muslim universalism that allowed any Muslim the possibility of\nachieving the highest state offices and political and social importance.\nPerhaps the most important phenomenon within the Abbasid caliphate was the great\nemphasis and respect the caliphs placed on learning. New discoveries were made in\nastronomy, metallurgy, and medicine, and learned works from a variety of languages were\ntranslated and preserved in Arabic. The most significant tradition of scholarship surrounding\nAristotle's works, in particular, took place in the Abbasid caliphate.\n251 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe major library in Baghdad was called the House of Wisdom; it was one of the great\nlibraries of the world at the time. The various advances that took place in the Abbasid Caliphate\nincluded:\n\u25cf Medicine: far more accurate diagnoses and treatments than existed anywhere else\n(outside of China).\n\u25cf Optics: early telescopes, along with the definitive refutation of the idea that the eye\nsends out beams to detect things and instead receives information reflected off of\nobjects.\n\u25cf Chemistry: various methods including evaporation, filtration, sublimation, and even\ndistillation. Despite the specific ban on intoxicants in the Koran, it was Abbasid chemists\nwho invented distilled spirits: al-kuhl, meaning \u201cthe essence,\" from which the English\nword alcohol derives.\n\u25cf Mathematics: the creation of Arabic numerals, based on Hindu characters, which were\nfar easier to work with than the clunky Roman equivalents. In turn, the Abbasids\ninvented algebra and trigonometry.\n\u25cf Geography and exploration: accurate maps of Asia and East Africa, thanks to the\npresence of Muslim merchant colonies as far as China, along with new navigational\ntechnologies like the astrolabe (a device that is used to determine latitude while at sea).\n\u25cf Banking: the invention of checks and forms of commercial insurance for merchants.\n\u25cf Massive irrigation systems, which made Mesopotamia nearly on par with Egypt as the\nrichest farmland in the world.\nScholars in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad.\n252 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nIn addition, the Abbasid Caliphate witnessed a major increase in literacy. Not only were\nMuslims (men and women alike) encouraged to memorize the Koran itself, but scholars and\nmerchants were often interchangeable; unlike medieval Christianity, Islam did not reject\ncommerce as being somehow morally tainted. Thus, Muslims, whose literacy was due to study\nof specifically Islamic texts, the Koran and the Hadith especially, easily used the same skills in\ncommerce. The overall result was a higher literacy rate than anywhere else in the world at the\ntime, with the concomitant advantages in technological progress and commercial prosperity.\nBuilding on their longstanding tradition of manuscript culture, this literate populace\nbecame voracious readers who demanded a prolific literary marketplace. In response, writers\nadapted traditional oral stories into great epics, invented the philosophical novel, and created a\nremarkable literary tradition that eventually produced world-famous and influential works such\nas the poetry of Rumi and the fantastical Book of One Thousand and One Nights. The\nlong-standing tradition of women\u2019s poetry in the region also flourished during this golden age of\nIslamic literature. These women came to poetry from vastly different perspectives; some were\ntaught to write in order to serve as enslaved courtesans, while others wrote in pursuit of greater\nspirituality. Both groups of women, however, created astonishingly expressive and popular\npoetry. Arabic-speaking women\u2019s poetry from this period ranged from love poems to satirical\nmocking of their husbands to Sufi mysticism to court songs. In this regard, the women of the\nAbbasid period (and the Andalus to come) stand out from their contemporary peers by firmly\nestablishing their poetry as a distinct form.\nThe success of the Abbasids in ruling a huge, diverse empire arose in part from their\nwillingness to follow Persian traditions of rule (a pattern that would be repeated by later Turkic\nand Mongol rulers). The Abbasid caliphs employed Persian bureaucrats and ruled in a manner\nsimilar to the earlier Persian Great Kings, although they did not adopt that title. Their role as\ncaliphs was in protecting the ummah and providing a political framework in which sharia law\ncould prosper - it was in the Abbasid period that Islamic law was truly developed and codified.\nFrom the Persian tradition the Abbasid caliphs borrowed both practical traditions of bureaucracy\nand administration and an equally important tradition of political status: they were the rulers over\nmany peoples, acknowledging local identities while expecting deference and, of course, taxes.\nAt its height, the Abbasid Empire was truly enormous\u2013 it covered more land area than\nhad the Roman Empire. Its merchants traveled from Spain to China, and it maintained\ndiplomatic relations with the rulers of territories thousands of miles from Baghdad. The\nCaliphate reached its peak during the rule of the caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786 \u2013 809). His\npalace was so enormous that it occupied one-third of Baghdad. He and the greatest\n253 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nearly-medieval European king, Charlemagne, exchanged presents and friendly letters, albeit out\nof political expediency: Charlemagne was the enemy of the Cordoban Caliphate of Spain, the\nlast vestige of Umayyad power, and the Abbasids acted as an external pressure that\nCharlemagne hoped would make the Byzantine emperors recognize the legitimacy of his\nimperial title (as an aside, one of Charlemagne\u2019s prized possessions was his pet elephant, sent\nto his distant court by al-Rashid as a goodwill gift).\nAlready by al-Rashid\u2019s reign, however, the Caliphate was splintering; it was simply too\nlarge to run efficiently without advanced bureaucratic institutions. North Africa west of Egypt\nseceded by 800, emerging as a group of rival Islamic kingdoms. Other territories followed suit\nduring the rest of the ninth century, leaving the Caliphate in direct control of only the core lands\nof Mesopotamia. Within its remaining territory the caliphs faced uprisings as well. Even the\nidea of a united (Sunni) ummah was a casualty of this political breakdown - the ruler of the\nSpanish kingdom claimed to be the \u201ctrue\u201d caliph, with a Shia dynasty in Egypt known as the\nFatimids contesting both claims since it rejected the very idea of a Sunni caliph.\nThe political independence of the Caliphate ended in 945 when it was conquered by\nTurkic nomads, who took control of secular power while keeping the Caliph alive as a\nfigurehead. In 1055, a different Turkic group, the Seljuks (the same group then menacing\nByzantium), seized control and did exactly the same thing. For the next two centuries the\nAbbasid caliphs enjoyed the respect and spiritual deference of most Sunni Muslims, but\nexercised no political power of their own.\nAs Seljuk power increased, that of the Caliphate itself waned. Numerous independent,\nand rival, Islamic kingdoms emerged across the Middle East, North Africa, and northern India,\nleaving even the Middle Eastern heartland vulnerable to foreign invasion, first by European\ncrusaders starting in 1095, and most disastrously during the Mongol invasion of 1258 (under a\ngrandson of Genghis Khan). It was the Mongols who ended the Caliphate once and for all,\nmurdering the last caliph and obliterating much of the infrastructure built during Abbasid rule in\nthe process.\nEurope\nTwo parts of Europe came under Arab rule: Spain and Sicily. Spain was the last of the\nlarge territories to be conquered during the initial Arab conquests, and Sicily was eventually\nconquered during the Abbasid period. In both areas, the rulers, Arab and North African\nimmigrants, and new converts to Islam lived alongside those who remained Christian or Jewish.\n254 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nDuring the Abbasid period in particular, Spain and Sicily were important as bridges between the\nIslamic and Christian worlds, where all faiths and peoples were tolerated. The city of Cordoba\nin Spain was a glorious metropolis, larger and more prosperous than any in Europe and any but\nBaghdad in the Arab world itself - it had a population of 100,000, paved streets, street lamps,\nand even indoor plumbing in the houses of the wealthy. All of the Arabic learning noted above\nmade its way to Europe primarily through contact between people in Spain and Sicily.\nThe greatest period of contrast between the eastern lands of Byzantium and the\ncaliphates, on the one hand, and most of Europe, on the other, was between the eighth and\neleventh centuries. During that period, there were no cities in Europe with populations of over\n15,000. The goods produced there, not to mention the quality of scholarship, were of abysmal\nquality compared to their Arab (or Byzantine) equivalents, and Christian Europe thus imported\nnumerous goods from the Arab world, often through Spain and Sicily. Europe was largely a\nbarter economy while the Muslim world was a currency-based market economy, with Shariah\nlaw providing a sophisticated legal framework for business transactions. Especially as\nByzantium declined, the Muslim kingdoms stood at the forefront of scholarship, commerce, and\nmilitary power.\nConclusion\nAs should be clear, the civilizations of the Middle East and North Africa were transformed\nby Islam, and the changes that Islam's spread brought with it were as permanent as were the\nresults of the Christianization of the Roman Empire earlier. The geographical contours of these\ntwo faiths would remain largely in place up to the present, while the shared civilization that\nbrought them into being continued to change.\nImage Citations (Creative Commons):\nMap of Arabia - Murraytheb\nThe Kaaba - \u0644\ufbfe\ufebb\ufef7\u0627 \u064a\u0631\ufebb\ufee3\ufedf\u0627\nThe Arab Conquests - Brian Szymanski\nHouse of Wisdom - Zereshk\n255 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nChapter 13: Early Medieval Europe\nIntroduction\nOnce the last remnants of Roman power west of the Balkans were extinguished in the\nlate fifth century CE, the history of Europe moved into the period that is still referred to as\n\"medieval,\" meaning \u201cmiddle\u201d (between). Roughly 1,000 years separated the fall of Rome and\nthe beginning of the Renaissance, the period of \"rebirth\" in which certain Europeans believed\nthey were recapturing the lost glory of the classical world. Historians have long since dismissed\nthe conceit that the Middle Ages were nothing more than the \u201cDark Ages\u201d so maligned by\nRenaissance thinkers, and thus this chapter seeks to examine the early medieval world on its\nown terms - in particular, what were the political, social, and cultural realities of post-Roman\nEurope?\nThe Roman Church\nAfter the fall of the western Roman empire, it was the Church that united Western\nEurope and provided a sense of European identity. That religious tradition would persist and\nspread, ultimately extinguishing the so-called \u201cpagan\u201d religions, despite the political\nfragmentation left in the wake of the fall of Rome. The one thing that nearly all Europeans\neventually came to share was membership in the Roman Church. In turn, a note on\nnomenclature: for the sake of clarity, this chapter will use the term \u201cRoman\u201d instead of \u201cCatholic\u201d\nto describe the western Church based in Rome during this period, because both the western\nRoman and Eastern Orthodox Churches claimed to be equally \u201ccatholic\u201d: universal. Another\nappropriate term is \u201cLatin Church,\u201d since the official language of the liturgy was Latin. Whatever\nterm is used, as an institution, the Church alone was capable of preserving at least some of the\nlegacy of ancient Rome.\nThat legacy was reflected in the learning preserved by the Church. For example, even\nthough Latin faded away as a spoken language, all but vanishing by about the eighth century\neven in Italy, the Bible and written communication between educated elites was still in Latin.\nLatin went from being the vernacular of the Roman Empire to being, instead, the language of\nthe educated elite all across Europe. An educated person (almost always a member of the\nclergy in this period) from England could still correspond to an educated person in Spain or Italy,\n256 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nbut that correspondence would take place in Latin. He or she would not be able to speak to\ntheir counterpart on the other side of the subcontinent, but they would share a written tongue.\nChristianity displayed a remarkable power to convert even peoples who had previously\nproved militarily stronger than Christian opponents, from the Germanic invaders who had\ndismantled the western empire to the Slavic peoples that fought Byzantium to a standstill.\nConversion often took place both because of the astonishing perseverance of Christian\nmissionaries and the desire on the part of non-Christians to have better political relationships\nwith Christians. That noted, there were also straightforward cases of forced conversions\nthrough military force - as described below, the Frankish king Charlemagne exemplified this\ntendency. Whether through heartfelt conversion or force, by the eleventh century almost\neveryone in Europe was a Christian, a Roman Christian in the west and an Orthodox Christian\nin the east.\nThe Papacy\nThe Roman Church was distinguished by the at least nominal leadership of the papacy\nbased in Rome - indeed, it was the papal claim to leadership of the Christian Church as a whole\nthat drove a permanent wedge between the western and eastern churches, since the Byzantine\nemperors claimed authority over both church and state. The popes were not just at the apex of\nthe western church, they often ruled as kings unto themselves, and they always had complex\nrelationships with other rulers. For the entire period of the early Middle Ages (from the end of\nthe western Roman Empire until the eleventh century), the popes were rarely acknowledged as\nthe sovereigns of the Church outside of Italy. Instead, this period was important in the longer\nhistory of institutional Christianity because many popes at least claimed authority over doctrine\nand organization - centuries later, popes would look back on the claims of their predecessors as\n\u201cproof\u201d that the papacy had always been in charge.\nAn important example of an early pope who created such a precedent is Gregory the\nGreat, who was pope at the turn of the seventh century. Gregory still considered Rome part of\nthe Byzantine Empire, but by that time Byzantium could not afford troops to help defend the city\nof Rome, and he was keenly interested in developing papal independence. As a result, Gregory\nshrewdly played different Germanic kings off against each other and used his spiritual authority\nto gain their trust and support. He sent missionaries into the lands outside of the kingdoms to\nspread Christianity, both out of a genuine desire to save souls and a pragmatic desire to see\nwider influence for the Church.\n257 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nGregory\u2019s authority was not based on military power, nor did most Christians at the time\nassume that the pope of Rome (all bishops were then called \u201cpope,\u201d meaning simply \u201cfather\u201d)\nwas the spiritual head of the entire Church. Instead, popes like Gregory slowly but surely\nasserted their authority by creating mutually-beneficial relationships with kings and by\noverseeing the expansion of Christian missionary work. In the eighth century, the papacy\nproduced a (forged, as it turned out) document known as the Donation of Constantine in which\nthe Roman emperor Constantine supposedly granted authority over the western Roman Empire\nto the pope of Rome; that document was often cited by popes over the next several centuries as\n\u201cproof\u201d of their authority. Nevertheless, even powerful and assertive popes had to be realistic\nabout the limits of their power, with many popes being deposed or even murdered in the midst\nof political turmoil.\nThus, Christianity spread not because of an all-powerful, highly centralized institution,\nbut because of the flexibility and pragmatism of missionaries and the support of secular rulers\n(the Franks, considered below, were critical in this regard). All across Europe, missionaries had\nofficial instructions not to battle pagan religious practice, but to subtly reshape it. It was less\nimportant that pagans understood the nuances of Christianity and more important that they\naccepted its essential truth. All manner of \"pagan\" practices, words, and traditions survive into\nthe present thanks to the crossover between Christianity and old pagan practices, including the\nnames of the days of the week in English (Wednesday is Odin's, or Wotan's, day, Thursday is\nThor's day, etc). and the word \u201cEaster\u201d itself, from the Norse goddess of spring and fertility\nnamed Eostre.\nAs an example, in a letter to one of the major early English Christian leaders (later a\nsaint), Bede, Pope Gregory advised Bede and his followers not to tear down pagan temples, but\nto consecrate and reuse them. Likewise, the existing pagan days of sacrifice were to be\nrededicated to God and the saints. Clearly, the priority was not an attempted purge of pagan\nculture, but instead the introduction of Christianity in a way that could more easily truly take root.\nAlthough the liturgy of the church continued to be transmitted in Latin, Bede and his followers\ngained a reputation for respecting the vernacular tongue. The oldest extant work of English\npoetry, \u2018Caedmon\u2019s Hymn\u2019, was in fact recorded and preserved by Bede himself in his book, An\nEcclesiastical History of the English People. This hymn, like many other examples of medieval\nperiod English literature, combines the basic precepts of Christianity with the traditional poetic\nforms and themes beloved in local Anglo-Saxon warrior culture, demonstrating one way the\nblending of Christianity with pagan tradition incorporated local aesthetic and aspirational ideals.\n258 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nMonks sometimes squabbled about the nuances of worship, but the key development was\nsimply the spread of Christianity and the growing influence of the Church.\nCharacteristics of Medieval Christianity\nThe fundamental belief of medieval Christians was that the Church as an institution was\nthe only path to spiritual salvation. It was much less important that a Christian understand any\nof the details of Christian theology than it was that they participate in Christian worship and,\nmost importantly, receive the sacraments administered by the clergy. Given that the immense\nmajority of the population was completely illiterate, it was impossible for most Christians to have\naccess to anything but the rudiments of Christian belief. The path to salvation was thus not\nknowing anything about the life of Christ, the characteristics of God, or the names of the\napostles, but of two things above all else: the sacraments and the relevant saints to pray to.\nThe sacraments were, and remain in contemporary Catholicism, the essential spiritual\nrituals conducted by ordained priests. Much of the practical, day-to-day power and influence\nexercised by the Church was based on the fact that only priests could administer the\nsacraments, making access to the Church a prerequisite for any chance of spiritual salvation in\nthe minds of medieval Christians. The sacraments are:\n1. Baptism - believed to be necessary to purge original sin from a newborn child. Without\nbaptism, medieval Christians believed, even a newborn who died would be denied\nentrance to heaven. Thus, most people tried to have their newborns baptized\nimmediately after birth, since infant mortality was extremely high.\n2. Communion - following the example of Christ at the last supper, the ritual by which\nmedieval Christians connected spiritually with God. One significant element of this was\nthe belief in transubstantiation: the idea that the wine and holy wafer literally transformed\ninto the blood and body of Christ at the moment of consumption.\n3. Confession - necessary to receive forgiveness for sins, which every human constantly\ncommitted.\n4. Confirmation - the pledge to be a faithful member of the Church taken in young\nadulthood.\n5. Marriage - believed to be sanctified by God.\n6. Holy orders - the vows taken by new members of the clergy.\n259 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\n7. Last Rites - a final ritual carried out at the moment of death to send the soul on to\npurgatory - the spiritual realm between earth and heaven where the soul's sins would be\nburned away over years of atonement and purification.\nUnlike in most forms of contemporary Christianity, which tend to focus on the relationship\nof the individual to God, medieval Christians did not usually feel worthy of direct contact with the\ndivine. Instead, the saints were hugely important to medieval Christians because they were\nboth holy and yet still human. Unlike the omnipotent and remote figure of God, medieval\nChristians saw the saints as beings who cared for individual people and communities and who\nwould potentially intercede on behalf of their supplicants. Thus, every village, every town, every\ncity, and every kingdom had a patron saint who was believed to advocate on its behalf.\nAlong with the patron saints, the figures of Jesus and Mary became much more\nimportant during this period. Saints had served as intermediaries before an almighty and remote\ndeity in the Middle Ages, but Church officials tried to advance veneration of Christ and Mary as\nequally universal but less overwhelming divine figures. Mary in particular represented a positive\nimage of women that had never existed before in Christianity. The growing importance of Mary\nwithin Christian practice led to a new focus on charity within the Church, since she was believed\nto intervene on behalf of supplicants without need of reward.\nMedieval Politics\nWhile most Europeans (excluding the Jewish communities, the few remaining pagans,\nand members of heretical groups) may have come to share a religious identity by the eleventh\ncentury, Europe was fragmented politically. The numerous Germanic tribes that had dismantled\nthe western Roman Empire formed the nucleus of the early political units of western\nChristendom. The Germanic peoples themselves had started as minorities, ruling over formerly\nRoman subjects. They tended to inherit Roman bureaucracy and rely on its officials and laws\nwhen ruling their subjects, but they also had their own traditions of Germanic law based on clan\nmembership.\nThe so-called \u201cfeudal\u201d system of law was one based on codes of honor and reciprocity.\nIn the original Germanic system, each person was tied to his or her clan above all else, and an\nattack on an individual immediately became an issue for the entire clan. Any dishonor had to be\nanswered by an equivalent dishonor, most often meeting insult with violence. Likewise,\nrulership was tied closely to clan membership, with each king being the head of the most\npowerful clan rather than an elected official or even necessarily a hereditary monarchy that\n260 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\ntranscended clan lines. This unregulated, traditional, and violence-based system of \u201claw,\u201d from\nwhich the modern English word \u201cfeud\u201d derives, stood in contrast to the written codes of Roman\nlaw that still survived in the aftermath of the fall of Rome itself.\nOver time, the Germanic rulers mixed with their subjects to the point that distinctions\nbetween them were nonexistent. Likewise, Roman law faded away to be replaced with traditions\nof feudal law and a very complex web of rights and privileges that were granted to groups within\nsociety by rulers (to help ensure the loyalty of their subjects). Thus, clan loyalty became less\nimportant over the centuries than did the rights, privileges, and pledges of loyalty offered and\nheld by different social categories: peasants, townsfolk, warriors, and members of the church.\nIn the process, medieval politics evolved over time into a hierarchical, class-based structure in\nwhich kings, lords, and priests ruled over the vast majority of the population: peasants.\nEventually, the relationship between lords and kings was formalized in a system of\nmutual protection (or even protection racket). A lord accepted pledges of loyalty, called a pledge\nof fealty, from other free men called his vassals; in return for their support in war he offered them\nprotection and land-grants called fiefs. Each vassal had the right to extract wealth from his land,\nmeaning the peasants who lived there, so that he could afford horses, armor, and weapons. In\ngeneral, vassals did not have to pay their lords taxes (all tax revenue came from the peasants).\nLikewise, the Church itself was an enormously wealthy and powerful landowner, and church\nholdings were almost always tax-exempt; bishops were often lords of their own lands, and every\nking worked closely with the Church's leadership in his kingdom.\n261 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nDepiction of a feudal pledge of fealty from Harold Godwinson, at the time a powerful\nAnglo-Saxon noble and later the king of England, to William of Normandy, who would go on to\ndefeat Harold and replace him as king of England. William claimed that Harold had pledged\nfealty to him, which justified his invasion (while Harold denied ever having done so).\nThis system arose because of the absence of other, more effective forms of government\nand the constant threat of violence posed by raiders. The system was never as neat and tidy as\nit sounds on paper; many vassals were lords of their own vassals, with the king simply being the\nhighest lord. In turn, the problem for royal authority was that many kings had \u201cvassals\u201d who had\nmore land, wealth, and power than they did; it was very possible, even easy, for powerful nobles\nto make war against their king if they chose to do so. It would take centuries before the\nmonarchs of Europe consolidated enough wealth and power to dominate their nobles, and it\ncertainly did not happen during the Middle Ages.\nOne (amusing, in historical hindsight) method that kings would use to punish unruly\nvassals was simply visiting them and eating them out of house and home - the traditions of\nhospitality required vassals to welcome, feed, and entertain their king for as long as he felt like\nstaying. Kings and queens expected respect and deference, but conspicuously absent was any\nappeal to what was later called the \u201cDivine Right\u201d of monarchs to rule. From the perspective of\n262 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nthe noble and clerical classes at the time the monarch had to hold on to power through force of\narms and personal charisma, not empty claims about being on the throne because of God\u2019s will.\nUnsurprisingly, there are many instances in medieval European history in which a\npowerful lord simply usurped the throne, defeated the former king's forces, and became the new\nking. Ultimately, medieval politics represented a \u201cwarlord\u201d system of political organization, in\nmany cases barely a step above anarchy. Pledges of loyalty between lords and vassals served\nas the only assurance of stability, and those pledges were violated countless times throughout\nthe period. The Church tried to encourage lords to live in accordance with Christian virtue, but\nthe fact of the matter was that it was the nobility\u2019s vocation, their very social role, to fight, and\nthus all too often \u201cpolitics\u201d was synonymous with \u201carmed struggle\u201d during the Middle Ages.\nEngland and France\nAnglo-Saxon England\nBy about 400 CE, the Romans abandoned Britain. Their legions were needed to help\ndefend the Roman heartland and Britain had always been an imperial frontier, with too few\nRomans to completely settle and \u201ccivilize\u201d it outside of southern England. For the next three\nhundred years, Germanic invaders called the Anglo-Saxons (from whom we get the name\n\u201cEngland\u201d itself - it means \u201cland of the Angles\u201d) from the areas around present-day northern\nGermany and Denmark invaded, raided, and settled in England. They fought the native Britons\n(i.e. the Romanized, Christian Celts native to England itself), the Cornish, the Welsh, and each\nother. Those Romans who had settled in England were pushed out, either fleeing to take refuge\nin Wales or across the channel to Brittany in northern France. England was thus the most\nthoroughly de-Romanized of the old Roman provinces in the west: Roman culture all but\nvanished, and thus English history \u201cbegan\u201d as that of the Anglo-Saxons.\nStarting in the late eighth century, the Anglo-Saxons suffered waves of Viking raids that\nculminated in the establishment of an actual Viking kingdom in what had been Anglo-Saxon\nterritory in eastern England. It took until 879 for the surviving English kingdom, Wessex, to\ndefeat the Viking invaders. For a few hundred years, there was an Anglo-Saxon kingdom in\nEngland that promoted learning and culture, producing an extensive literature in the\nAnglo-Saxon language (which is commonly called Old English). The best-preserved example of\nthis literature is the epic poem Beowulf, which melds traditional Anglo-Saxon warrior virtues with\nChristian philosophy, providing further evidence of the type of cultural blend which continued\nafter the time of Bede (c. 672-735 CE). The relative peace of Anglo-Saxon England proved\n263 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nvulnerable to invasion, however, and in 1066 William the Conqueror, a Viking-descended king\nfrom Normandy in northern France, invaded, defeated the Anglo-Saxon king, and instituted\nNorman rule.\nFrance\nThe former Roman province of Gaul is the heartland of present-day France, ruled in the\naftermath of the fall of Rome by the Franks, a powerful Germanic people who invaded Gaul\nfrom across the Rhine as Roman power crumbled. The Franks were a warlike and crafty group\nled by a clan known as the Merovingians. A Merovingian king, Clovis (r. 481 \u2013 511) was the first\nto unite the Franks and begin the process of creating a lasting kingdom named after them:\nFrance. Clovis murdered both the heads of other clans who threatened him as well as his own\nfamily members who might take over command of the Merovingians. He then expanded his\nterritories and defeated the last remnants of Roman power in Gaul by the end of the fifth\ncentury.\nIn 500 CE Clovis and a few thousand of his most elite warriors converted to Roman\nChristianity, less out of a heartfelt sense of piety than for practical reasons: he planned to attack\nthe Visigoths of Spain, Arian Christians who ruled over Latin Christian former Romans. By\nconverting to Roman Christianity, Clovis ensured that the subjects of the Goths were likely to\nwelcome him as a liberator rather than a foreign invader. He was proved right, and by 507 the\nFranks controlled almost all of Gaul, including formerly-Gothic territories along the border.\nThe Merovingians held on to power for two hundred years. In the end, they became\nrelatively weak and ineffectual, with another clan, the Carolingians, running most of their political\naffairs. It was a Carolingian, Charles Martel, who defeated the invading Arab armies at the\nBattle of Tours (also referred to as the Battle of Poitiers) in 732. Soon afterwards, Charles\nMartel\u2019s son Pepin seized power from the Merovingians in a coup, one later ratified by the pope\nin Rome, ensuring the legitimacy of the shift and establishing the Carolingians as the rightful\nrulers of the Frankish kingdom.\nOnly the first few kings in the Merovingian dynasty of the Franks were particularly smart\nor capable. When Pepin seized control in 750 CE, he was merely assuming the legal status that\nhis clan had already controlled behind the scenes for years. The problem facing the Franks was\nthat Frankish tradition stipulated that lands were to be divided between sons after the death of\nthe father. Thus, with every generation, a family's holdings could be split into separate, smaller\npieces. Over time, this could reduce a large and powerful territory into a large number of small,\nweak ones. When Pepin died in 768, his sons Charlemagne and Carloman each inherited half\n264 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nof the kingdom. When Carloman died a few years later, however, Charlemagne ignored the right\nof Carloman\u2019s sons to inherit his land and seized it all (his nephews were subsequently\nmurdered).\nCharlemagne (r. 768 \u2013 814) was one of the most important kings in medieval European\nhistory. Charlemagne waged constant wars during his long reign (lasting over 40 years) in the\nname of converting non-Christian Germans to his east and, equally, in the name of seizing loot\nfor his followers. From his conquests arose the concept of the Holy Roman Empire, a huge\nstate that was nominally controlled by a single powerful emperor directly tied to the pope's\nauthority in Rome. In truth, only under Charlemagne was the empire a truly united state, but the\nconcept (with various emperors exercising at least some degree of authority) survived until 1806\nwhen it was finally permanently dismantled by Napoleon. Thus, like the western Roman Empire\nthat it succeeded, the Holy Roman Empire lasted almost exactly 1,000 years.\nCharlemagne distinguished himself not just by the extent of the territories that he\nconquered, but by his insistence that he rule those territories as the new, rightful king. In 773, at\nthe request of the pope, Charlemagne invaded the northern Italian kingdom of the Lombards,\nthe Germanic tribe that had expelled Byzantine forces earlier. When Charlemagne conquered\nthem a year later, he declared himself king of the Lombards, rather than forcing a new Lombard\nruler to become a vassal and pay tribute. This was an unprecedented development: it was\nuntraditional for a Germanic ruler to proclaim himself king of a different people - how could\nCharlemagne be \"king of the Lombards,\u201d since the Lombards were a separate clan and\nkingdom? This bold move on Charlemagne\u2019s part established the answer as well as an\nimportant precedent (inspired by Pepin\u2019s takeover): a kingship could pass to a different clan or\neven kingdom itself depending on the political circumstances. Charlemagne was up to\nsomething entirely new, intending to create an empire of various different Germanic groups, with\nhimself (and by extension, the Franks) ruling over all of them.\nIn 800, Charlemagne was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by the pope, Leo III. While\nCharlemagne\u2019s biographers claimed that this came as a surprise to Charlemagne, it was\nanything but; Charlemagne completely dominated Leo and looked to use the prestige of the\nimperial title to cement his hold on power. Charlemagne had already restored Leo to his throne\nafter Leo was run out of Rome by powerful Roman families who detested him. While visiting\nItaly (which was now part of his empire), Charlemagne was crowned and declared to be the\nemperor of Rome, a title that no one had held since the western empire fell in 476. Making the\nsituation all the stranger was the fact that the Byzantine emperors considered themselves to be\n265 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nfully \u201cRoman\u201d - from their perspective, Leo\u2019s crowning of Charlemagne was a straightforward\nusurpation.\nCharlemagne\u2019s empire at its height stretched from northern Spain to Bohemia (the present-day\nCzech Republic). His major areas of conquest were in Central Europe, forming the earliest\niteration of \u201cGermany\u201d as a state.\nCharlemagne\u2019s empire was a poor reflection of ancient Rome. He had almost no\nbureaucracy, no standing army, not even an official currency. He spent almost all of his reign\ntraveling around his empire with his armies, both leading wars and issuing decrees. He did\ninsist, eventually, that these decrees be written down, and the form of \u201ccode\u201d used to ensure\ntheir authenticity was simply that they were written in grammatically correct Latin, something\nthat almost no one outside of Charlemagne\u2019s court (and some members of the clergy scattered\nacross Europe) could accomplish thanks to the abysmal state of education and literacy at the\ntime.\nCharlemagne organized his empire into counties, ruled by (appropriately enough)\ncounts, usually his military followers but sometimes commoners, all of whom were sent to rule\nlands they did not have any personal ties to. He protected his borders with marches, lands ruled\n266 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nby margraves who were military leaders ordered to defend the empire from foreign invasion. He\nestablished a group of officials who traveled across the empire inspecting the counties and\nmarches to ensure loyalty to the crown. Despite all of his efforts, rebellions against his rule were\nfrequent and Charlemagne was forced to war against former subjects to re-establish control on\nseveral occasions.\nCharlemagne also reorganized the Church by insisting on a strict hierarchy of\narchbishops to supervise bishops who, in turn, supervised priests. Likewise, under\nCharlemagne there was a revival of interest in ancient writings and in proper Latin. He gathered\nscholars from all of Europe, including areas like England beyond his political control, and\nsponsored the education of priests and the creation of libraries. He had flawed versions of the\nVulgate (the Latin Bible) corrected and he revived disciplines of classical learning that had fallen\ninto disuse (including rhetoric, logic, and astronomy). His efforts to reform Church training and\neducation are referred to by historians as the \"Carolingian Renaissance.\"\nOne innovation of note that arose during the Carolingian Renaissance is that\nCharlemagne instituted a major reform of handwriting, returning to the Roman practice of large,\nclear letters that are separated from one another and sentences that used spaces and\npunctuation, rather than the cursive scrawl of the Merovingian period. This new handwriting\nintroduced the division between upper and lower-case letters and the practice of starting\nsentences with the former that we use to this day.\nCharlemagne\u2019s funding of the scriptorium, which was devoted to the reproduction of\nmanuscript books in this new style of manuscript, is responsible for the preservation of many\nclassical and Christian works which would otherwise have been lost. The Carolingians\u2019 ability to\nrapidly reproduce manuscripts was also useful as an early type of propaganda. Court historians\nrecorded the king\u2019s achievements in their annals, in particular highlighting his military victories.\nThese annals created a vision of what the kingdom represented, focusing on the most valued\naspects of royalty, and making Charlemagne a legendary figure in his own lifetime.\nUltimately, the Carolingian dynasty lasted for an even shorter period than had the\nMerovingian. The problem, again, was the Frankish succession law. Without an effective\nbureaucracy or law code, there was little cohesion to the kingdom, and areas began to split off\nalmost immediately after Charlemagne\u2019s death in 814. The origin of \u201cGermany\u201d (not politically\nunited until 1871, over a thousand years after Charlemagne\u2019s lifetime) was East Francia, the\nkingdom that Charlemagne\u2019s son Louis the Pious left to one of his sons. A different line, not\ndirectly descended from the Carolingians, eventually ended up in power in East Francia. Its\n267 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nking, Otto I, was crowned emperor in 962 by the Pope, thereby cementing the idea of the Holy\nRoman Empire even after Charlemagne\u2019s bloodline no longer ruled it.\nInvaders\nPost-Carolingian Europe was plunged into a period of disorder and violence that lasted\nuntil at least 1100 CE. Even though the specific invaders mentioned below had settled down by\nabout 1000 CE, the overall state of lawlessness and violence lasted for centuries. In addition to\nattacks by groups like the Vikings, the major political problem of the Middle Ages was that the\nwhole feudal system was one based on violence: lesser lords often had no livelihood outside of\nwar, and they pressured their own lords to initiate raids on nearby lands. \"Knights\" were often\nlittle better than thugs who had the distinction of a minor noble title and the ability to afford\nweapons and armor. Likewise, one of the legacies of feudal law was the importance placed on\nhonor and retribution; any insult or slight could initiate reprisals or even plunge a whole kingdom\ninto civil war.\nMeanwhile, a series of invasions began in the post-Carolingian era. Arab invaders\ncalled Saracens attacked southern European lands, even conquering Sicily in the ninth century,\nwhile a new group of steppe raiders, the Magyars, swept across Europe in the tenth century,\neventually seizing land and settling in present-day Hungary. In Northern Europe, the most\nsignificant invaders of the period, however, were the Vikings.\nThe Vikings\nUntil the eighth century, the Scandinavian region was on the periphery of European\ntrade, and Scandinavians (the Norse) themselves did not greatly influence the people of\nneighboring regions. Scandinavians had long traded amber (petrified sap, prized as a precious\nstone in Rome and, subsequently, throughout the Middle Ages) with both other Germanic tribes\nand even with the Romans directly during the imperial period. While the details are unclear,\nwhat seems to have happened is that sometime around 700 CE the Baltic Sea region became\nincreasingly economically significant. Traders from elsewhere in northern Europe actively\nsought out Baltic goods like furs, timber, fish, and (as before) amber. This created an ongoing\nflow of wealth coming into Scandinavia, which in turn led to Norse leaders becoming interested\nin the sources of that wealth. At the same time, the Norse added sails to their unique sailing\nvessels, longships. Sailed longships allowed the Norse to travel swiftly across the Baltic, and\nultimately across and throughout the waterways of Europe.\n268 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe Oseberg ship, a surviving Viking longship discovered in a Viking burial mound in\nNorway and preserved in a dedicated museum in Oslo. Longships allowed the Vikings\nunprecedented mobility, being capable of both oceanic voyages and of sailing up rivers to raid\ninland communities.\nThe Norse, soon known as Vikings, exploded into the consciousness of other Europeans\nduring the eighth century, attacking unprotected Christian monasteries in the 790s, with the first\nmajor raid in 793 and follow-up attacks over the next two years. The Vikings swiftly became the\ngreat naval power of Europe at the time. In the early years of the Viking period they tended to\nstrike in small raiding parties, relying on swiftness and stealth to pillage monasteries and\nsettlements. As the decades went on, bands of raiders gave way to full-scale invasion forces,\nnumbering in the hundreds of ships and thousands of warriors. They went in search of riches of\nall kinds, but especially silver, which was their standard of wealth, and slaves, who were equally\nlucrative. Unfortunately for the monks of Europe, silver was most often used in sacred objects\nin monasteries, making the monasteries the favorite targets of Viking raiders. The raids were so\nsudden and so destructive that Charlemagne himself ordered the construction of fortifications at\nthe mouth of the Seine river and began expanding his naval defenses to try to defend against\nthem.\n269 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nThe word \"Viking\" was used by the Vikings themselves \u2013 it either meant \u201craider\u201d or was a\nreference to the Vik region that spanned parts of Norway and Sweden. They were known by\nvarious other names by the people they raided, from the Middle East to France: the Franks\ncalled them \u201cpagani\u201d or \u201cNorthmen,\u201d the Anglo-Saxons \u201chaethene men,\u201d the Arabs \u201cal-Majus\u201d\n(sorcerers), the Germanic tribes \u201cascomanni\u201d (shipmen), and the Slavs of what would become\nRussia the \u201cRus\u201d or \u201cVarangians\u201d (the latter are described below.) Outside of the lands that\nwould eventually become Russia, the Vikings were universally regarded as a terrifying threat,\nnot least because of their staunch paganism and rapacious treatment of Christians.\nAt their height, the Vikings fielded huge fleets that raided many of the major cities of\nearly medieval Europe and North Africa. By the late ninth century they were formally organized\ninto a \u201cGreat Fleet\u201d based in their kingdom in eastern England (they conquered the Anglo-Saxon\nkingdom of East Anglia in the 870s). While the precise numbers will never be known, not least\nbecause the surviving sources bear a pronounced anti-Viking bias, it is clear that their raids\nwere on a scale that dwarfed their earlier efforts. In 844 more than 150 ships sailed up the\nGaronne River in southern France, plundering settlements along the way. In 845, 800 ships\nforced the city of Hamburg in northern Germany to pay a huge ransom of silver. In 881, the\nGreat Fleet pillaged across present-day Holland, raiding inland as far as Charlemagne\u2019s capital\nof Aachen and sacking it. Then, in 885, at least 700 ships sailed up the Seine River and\nbesieged Paris (note that their initial target, a rich monastery, had evacuated with its treasure;\nthe wine cellar was not spared, however). In this attack, they extorted thousands of pounds of\nsilver and gold. Vikings attacked Constantinople at least three times in the ninth and tenth\ncenturies, extracting tribute and concessions in trade, and perhaps most importantly, they came\nto rule over what would one day become Russia. In the end, the Vikings became increasingly\nknowledgeable about the places they were raiding, in some cases actually working as\nmercenaries for kings who hired them to defend against other Vikings.\nStarting in roughly 850 CE, the Vikings started to settle in the lands they raided,\nespecially in England, Scotland, the hitherto-uninhabited island of Iceland, and part of France.\nOutside of Russia, their most important settlement in terms of its historical impact was\nNormandy in what is today northern France, a kingdom that would go on centuries later to\nconquer England itself. It was founded in 911 as a land-grant to the Viking king Rollo in order to\ndefend against other Vikings. Likewise, the Vikings settled areas in England that would help\nshape the English language and literary traditions (for example, though written in the language\nof the Anglo-Saxons, the famous epic poem Beowulf is about Viking settlers who had recently\nconverted to Christianity). Ultimately, the Vikings became so rich from raiding that they became\n270 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nimportant figures in medieval trade and commerce, trading goods as far from Scandinavia as\nBaghdad in the Abbasid Caliphate.\nThe Vikings were not just raiders, however. They sought to explore and settle in lands\nthat were in some cases completely uninhabited when they arrived, like Iceland. They appear\nto have been fearless in quite literally going where no one had gone before. Much of their\nexploration required audacity as well as planning - they were the best navigators of their age,\nbut at times their travels led them to forge into areas completely unknown to Europeans.\nVikings were the first Europeans to arrive in North America, with a group of Icelandic Vikings\narriving in Newfoundland, in present-day Canada, around the start of the eleventh century. An\nattempt at colonization failed, however, quite possibly because of a conflict between the Vikings\nand the Indigenous people they encountered, and the people of the Americas were thus spared\nthe presence of further European colonists for almost five centuries.\nIn what eventually became Russia, meanwhile, Viking exploration, conquest, and\ncolonization had begun even earlier. The Vikings started traveling down Russian rivers from the\nBaltic in the mid-eighth century, even before the raiding period began farther west. Their initial\nmotive was trade, not conquest, trading and collecting goods like furs, amber, and honey and\ntransporting them south to both Byzantium and the Abbasid Caliphate. The Vikings were\nslavers as well, capturing Slavic peoples and selling them in the south. In turn, the Vikings\nbrought a great deal of Byzantine and Abbasid currency to the north, introducing hard cash into\nthe mostly barter-based economies of Northern and Western Europe. Eventually, they settled\nalong their trade routes, often invited to establish order by the native Slavs in cities like Kyiv,\nwith the Vikings ultimately forming the earliest nucleus of Russia as a political entity. The very\nname \u201cRussia'' derives from \u201cRus,\u201d the name of the specific Viking people (originally from\nSweden) who settled in the Slavic lands bordering Byzantium.\n271 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nEleventh-century illustration of the Varangian Guard, the personal bodyguards of the Byzantine\nemperors starting in the tenth century. The guard was composed of warriors from the Rus, the\nVikings who conquered and then settled in present-day Russia and Ukraine.\nAs the Vikings settled in the lands they had formerly raided and as powerful states\nemerged in Scandinavia itself, the Vikings ceased being raiders and came to resemble other\nmedieval Europeans. By the mid-tenth century, the kings of the Scandinavian lands began to\nassert their control and to reign in Viking raids. Conversion to Christianity, becoming very\ncommon by 1000, helped end the raiding period as well. Denmark became a stable kingdom\nunder its king Harald Bluetooth in 958, Norway in 995 under Olaf Tryggvason, and Sweden in\n995 as well under Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung. Meanwhile, in northern France, the kingdom of Normandy\nemerged as the most powerful of the former Viking states, with its duke William the Conqueror\nconquering England itself from the Anglo-Saxons in 1066.\nConclusion\nWhile the Vikings are important for various reasons - expanding Medieval trade, settling\nvarious regions, establishing the first European contact with North America, and founding the\nfirst Russian states - they are also included here simply for their inherent interest; their raids and\nexpansion were one of the most striking and sudden in world history.\nFar more important to the historical record were the larger patterns of state and society\nthat formed in the early Middle Ages. Above all, the feudal system would have a long legacy in\n272 WesternCivilization:AConciseHistory\nforming the basis of later political structures, and the Latin Church would be the essential\nEuropean intellectual and spiritual institution for centuries to come. Early medieval Europe was\ndefined by shared cultural traits in both oral and manuscript transmission; above all having to do\nwith religion, but also preserving the earliest epic stories and poems in a number of languages.\nDespite having lost the opulence and much of the learning of Rome, medieval Europe was not a\nstatic, completely backwards place. Instead, it slowly but surely constructed an entirely new\nform of society in place of what had been.\nImage Citations (Wikimedia Commons):\nPledge of Fealty - Myrabella\nCarolingian Empire - Electionworld\nOseberg Ship - Peulle\nVarangian Guard - Public Domain\n273"
