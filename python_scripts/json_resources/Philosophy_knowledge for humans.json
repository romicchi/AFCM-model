We\ncan of course disagree about whether it is important to know\nthe history of astrology, or the grammar of dead languages, or\nthe mating habits of warblers, but only a stubborn blockhead\nwould insist that it is not important to know. One might even\nbe said to forfeit one\u2019s humanity by denying the importance of\nknowledge.\nGiven its extraordinary importance, it follows that it would\nbe good to know what knowledge is, how to gain it, how to\nbe sure one has it, and its effects upon individuals, political\nstates, and societies, and so on. For many of these questions\nwe should turn to philosophers. But unfortunately quite a lot\nof these questions have so fascinated academic philosophers\nthat their discussions of them have spiraled off into inaccessible\nregions of forbidding jargon. Moreover, many of these\ndiscussions are bound to a single discipline, as if there is only\none set of questions one should ask about knowledge. It is hard\nfor a curious human being to know where to go to get started\nin understanding knowledge in some more expansive fashion.\nHence Knowledge for Humans, meaning knowledge for\nhumans who are intelligent and curious, but have not yet been 2 | INTRODUCTION\nshunted into specialized regions of abstract scholarship. The\nidea behind this text is to offer some introductory\nphilosophical discussions about knowledge combined with\nsome attention to science, history, media, politics, and\npsychology. It is meant to pull together different aspects of\nknowledge into a package that a philosophically curious reader\nmight find interesting.\nI wish to thank my students for reading through the text\nand offering feedback, to my friend and colleague Professor\nRichard Greene for doing the same, and to the Open\nEducational Resources team at Utah State University who\nhelped to put the text into an accessible form. Any errors in the\ntext are due to my own ignorance, appropriately enough. PART I\n1. KNOWLEDGE:\nTHE BASICS\n\u201cKnowledge itself is power.\u201d\n\u2014 Francis Bacon (1597)\nMost of the time we want knowledge. Knowing means\nunderstanding what is true and perhaps being able to shape\nevents toward our own ends. Ignorant people are generally not\nesteemed (though sometimes we might envy the person who is\nin a bad situation but does not know enough to be troubled by\nit; that\u2019s when we say, \u201cIgnorance is bliss\u201d.). We seek knowledge\nboth for the advantages it gives us and even for its own sake.\nIn a great many cases, if not in every case, it is simply better\nto know than not to know. Philosophers sometimes have said\nthat the pursuit of knowledge is essential to human nature.\n\u201cAll humans by nature desire to know\u201d is how Aristotle begins\nhis Metaphysics. 4 | 1. KNOWLEDGE: THE BASICS\nBecause knowledge is so important to us, we fight over it. One\ngroup claims that X is true, another group insists that X is\nfalse, and a fight breaks out at least in words, if not in fisticuffs,\nover whether X is true\u2014which is to say whether it should\ncount as known. Authoritative institutions often seek to\ncontrol knowledge both in terms of who can have it and what\nshould count as known. We often turn to science as an\ninstitution to decide whether claims are known or not, which\ngives \u201cscience\u201d \u2013 meaning scientists, at universities and in\nresearch labs \u2013 a huge amount of power. Each year the world\nspends a trillion dollars on research and development in\nscience which means there is a lot of money we are willing to\nspend on figuring out what is known.\nSo, what is knowledge? What is it to know something?\nPhilosophers usually start to answer big questions like this by\nmaking distinctions and making the discussion more precise. 1.\nKNOWLEDGE\nFirst, let\u2019s ask what sorts of things are \u201cknown\u201d in the sense\nwe are interested. In a claim of the form \u201cSluggo knows X,\u201d\nwhat sort of entity goes into the \u201cX\u201d spot? We could fill in\nthe blank with phrases like \u201chow to ride a bike,\u201d \u201chow to\nspeak Esperanto,\u201d or \u201chow to dance like a maniac.\u201d These\nare abilities Sluggo may or may not have, and we might call\nthis sort of knowledge know-how. Philosophers typically are\nnot very interested in know-how since we have not yet come\nacross many interesting questions or problems to raise about\nit. Instead, we could put into the \u201cX\u201d spot phrases like \u201cthat\nBangladesh and India share a border,\u201d or \u201cthat Jupiter is larger\nthan Mars,\u201d or \u201cthat Francis Bacon is credited with having said\nthat knowledge is power.\u201d For obvious reasons, this is called\nknowledge-that, and what is known, or what goes in the \u201cX\u201d\nspot, are claims that may be true or false which philosophers\ncall \u201cpropositions.\u201d Philosophers are very interested in\npropositional knowledge.\nSo, let\u2019s continue to focus on propositional knowledge. We 6 | KNOWLEDGE\nwill want to know what features a proposition has to have\nin order for us to rightly say that someone knows it. We have\nalready seen one back when we were observing that people\nsometimes fight over knowledge or truth. A claim to know X\nis, among other things, a claim that X is true. No one would\never claim to know something they believe is false. (Well, they\nmight if they were lying. But if they were not trying to lie,\nand they were well aware of what they are saying, and they\nwere not under the influence of some strange drug or head\ninjury, they would never say, \u201cI think X is false and that I\nknow it.\u201d) Furthermore, we would not claim that someone else\nknew something if we thought that that something were false.\nI would not say that Sluggo knows the world is flat since the\nworld isn\u2019t flat. Sluggo might believe it is, but he does not know\nit because it isn\u2019t.\nThis is a tricky point, so we should spend a little more time\non it. Some time ago, people thought the sun revolved around\nthe earth. They had good reason for believing this since it\ncertainly looks like the sun revolves around the earth at the rate\nof once per day, and we do not feel the earth to be in motion.\nBut would we say these people knew it? They believed it, yes,\nand they had their reasons, yes, and they thought they knew\nit, yes. But did they know it? We might say they \u201cknew\u201d it,\nbut it would be important to keep those scare-quotes attached KNOWLEDGE | 7\nbecause they did not really know it. They did not know it\nbecause the claim is false, and they were wrong.\n(Or so it seems to me. Perhaps my use of the word \u201cknow\u201d has\nbeen corrupted by reading too much philosophy. But at the\nvery least there is one widespread meaning of the word \u201cknow\u201d\nwhich implies that what is known is in fact true, and in what\nfollows, that is the sense of \u201cknow\u201d we will be using.)\nThis discussion also suggests a further feature of propositions\nwe claim to know: we must also believe them, or in other\nwords, believe they are true. There may be some cases of people\nreally knowing something deep down in their bones but not\nadmitting it to themselves. Perhaps these are cases when\nsomeone knows something and, in a certain sense, does not\nbelieve it. But let\u2019s mark these cases as special exceptions to the\nmore general rule that we believe the things we know.\nFrom what we have seen so far, knowledge is believing true\npropositions. But there is a further feature we need to add.\nKnowledge usually involves some amount of evidence or\nreasoning or reliable report. It is not a lucky guess, like\ncorrectly predicting a coin toss. We can call this general feature 8 | KNOWLEDGE\n\u201cjustification,\u201d meaning that if we really do know some\nproposition, we could provide some reasons or evidence for\nthe truth of that proposition.\nAnd so we arrive at a time-honored definition of knowledge:\nTo know a proposition is to have a justified belief in that\nproposition and for that proposition to be true. If I believe it and\nhave some good reason for believing it, and if it is true, then I\nknow it. For obvious reasons, this is called the \u201cjustified true\nbelief\u201d definition of knowledge, and in fact it is so common\nthat it is sometimes just referred to by its initials: JTB.\nBut philosophers love to test definitions against their own\nimaginative powers, and so challenges have been posed to JTB.\nHere is a case where the letter of the definition is met, but\nintuitively, it does not seem to be a case of knowledge. Suppose\nthat Molly walks into her bedroom one night and flips on\nthe light switch, but the light does not come on. She tries the\nswitch a few more times, but still the light does not come on.\nShe considers that the light bulb has been in use for a long\ntime and that it is about time for it to have burned out. Just to\nbe sure, she checks to make sure the bulb is screwed securely\ninto its socket. It is. \u201cAh,\u201d she thinks. \u201cThe light bulb must\nhave burned out.\u201d Let us also suppose that, in fact, she is right: KNOWLEDGE | 9\nThe light bulb has burned out. But what she doesn\u2019t know is\nthat Doug is in the basement, and he has turned off the circuit\nbreaker for her bedroom. So the light bulb would not have\ncome on even if it had not been burned out. Does Molly\u2019s\nbelief that her lightbulb has burned out count as knowledge?\nShe believes the lightbulb has burned out, and she is right\nabout that. She also has at least some justification for her belief\nsince she has tried the switch a few times. She remembers how\nold the bulb is and correctly infers that it would be likely for\nthe bulb to have burned out at this time. She confirms that the\nbulb is screwed in securely. So she meets the JTB conditions.\nBut in a very important sense, Molly has simply lucked out\nthis time. She accidentally got to the right conclusion, and her\nbelief does not really count as knowledge.\nTo try to repair the JTB account, we might further require that\nthe truth of the proposition is not accidental to the person\u2019s\njustification for their belief. In Molly\u2019s case, as we said, it was\nlucky for her that the bulb was in fact burned out; its being\nburned out did not actively contribute to the evidence she was\ngathering for her belief since all of that evidence would have\nbeen the same anyway even if the bulb was in good working\norder due to Doug\u2019s interference. Another way to make this 10 | KNOWLEDGE\npoint is to say that, in a case of knowledge, the truth of the\nthing being known helps to explain why the person believes\nwhat they do.\nWith this in mind, we might offer the JTB+ definition of\nknowledge: S knows P if and only if S believes P, S\u2019s belief has\njustification, P is true, and the truth of P helps to explain why\nS comes to believe P.\nOf course, much of this is still unclear. How much\njustification does one need? Will any old justification be\nsufficient, or must the justification be of a certain kind? What\ndoes \u201chelps to explain\u201d mean? Is it okay to help a little, or must\nit be a lot? And even if we manage to make these matters clear,\ncan we be sure that there aren\u2019t some further clever challenges\nto JTB+ arising from the fertile imaginations of philosophers?\nBut we will leave these worries and unclarities to the side, at\nleast for now, and be content to have given at least a set of\nfeatures central to cases of knowledge. However, we should\nexplore this \u201ctruth\u201d business a little further. 2.\nTRUTH\nAt this point someone might raise an objection:\nObjection: You have claimed that\nknowledge implies truth\u2014in other\nwords, in order to know something,\nthat something must, in fact, be\ntrue. But this makes the definition\nentirely useless. If we have to know\nwhat\u2019s true in order to figure out\nwhat we know, then why bother with\nany definition for \u201cknowledge\u201d in\nthe first place? Why not just rest\ncontent with the truth?\nThis is a good question. It forces us to become clear about\nwhat we want in a definition. Sometimes we want to use\ndefinitions to help us sort things into categories. Consider,\nfor example, the standards set forth by the American Kennel\nAssociation for figuring out when this or that animal is a\nmember of this or that breed. In this case, we want the 12 | TRUTH\ndefinition to act as a sorting mechanism to help us decide\nwhether this or that thing should be called whatever it is we are\ndefining. But other times, we simply want a definition to tell us\nin a more general way how the target concept relates to other\nconcepts. This increases our understanding of the concepts,\nthough may not decisively settle any disputes.\nThe JTB+ definition of knowledge is definitely the second\nsort of definition. We have seen that knowledge is related to\nbelief, truth, justification, and explanation, though this has not\nbrought us any closer to being able to assemble some sort of\n\u201clitmus test\u201d we can use to determine which of our beliefs\nshould count as knowledge. The effort to assemble such a test\nhas a long history in philosophy; it is the effort to refute\nskepticism. We will discuss that at length later on.\nBut let us pause over truth a bit longer. What is truth? This is\nthe sort of question philosophy is famous for, and one might\nexpect a very impressive and mysterious answer like \u201cTruth\nis beauty\u201d or \u201cTruth is what releases us from ourselves\u201d or\nsomething else. These are interesting claims to reflect on. But\nin fact, philosophers typically rely on a simple and\nstraightforward meaning of truth. First, we need to ask again\nwhat sorts of things are true. Are we talking about people, TRUTH | 13\nconcepts, neutrons, or what? Once again, it is propositions\nor sentences that we say are true or false. So what makes a\nproposition true? Here is the simple answer: a proposition is\ntrue if and only if it describes how things really are. When a\nproposition matches reality, the proposition is true. That\u2019s it.\nObjection: Once again, this seems\nlike a useless answer. How do we\nknow what reality is? And without\nknowing what reality is, how can\nwe determine which propositions are\ntrue?\nThese are great questions, and they are at the foundation of\nepistemology. If we want knowledge, we want to know what\u2019s\ntrue, or what reality is, and how we should go about\ndiscovering what reality is, and what we should do when we\nare not completely sure what\u2019s true. That\u2019s what this book is\nabout.\nHere is everything we have said so far summarized in cartoon\nform: 14 | TRUTH\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Figure 1.1 \u00a9 Charlie Huenemann is licensed under a CC\nBY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license 3.\nWHAT WAS FRANCIS\nBACON TALKING\nABOUT?\nThe quote at the start of this chapter says that knowledge\nitself is power. That sounds mightily impressive. What does it\nmean?\nOne thing it might mean is that if you have knowledge, you\nwill have power. Maybe it won\u2019t be a lot of power, if what you\nknow is trivial. But if you know an important secret, it may\ngive you some power. Certainly a lot of the power humans\nhave is due to their scientific knowledge. If knowledge implies\ntruth, then having knowledge means knowing what reality is.\nOnce you know that, you will be much more successful in your\nendeavors than you would be if you didn\u2019t know how reality\nis. Reality punishes ignorance with failure. 16 | WHAT WAS FRANCIS BACON TALKING ABOUT?\nBut claiming that knowledge itself is power might also mean\nsomething else. It might mean that knowing how reality\nis\u2014just the knowledge of it, never mind doing anything with\nthat knowledge\u2014somehow improves our condition as beings\nwho are able to think. It is good to know, and not just because\nknowledge will make us more successful, but because, well, it\nis just good to know. Many things are simply intrinsically good\n(meaning they are good in and of themselves). It is good to love\nand to appreciate poetry and to have fun and to have friends\nand to know. These things make us better human beings\nbecause they are part of living good human lives. Aristotle\ncalled knowledge a virtue which just means that it is a good\nthing for a human to have because the human is human. A\nvirtue is a power in the sense of being a capacity for a specific\nkind of being. Humans are the sort of being that is capable of\nknowing; it is a power we have. Indeed, one might say it is a\nhuman superpower since we have not yet met other sorts of\nbeings who are better at it than we are.\nThere is a third thing the claim might mean. Because of the\nfirst two meanings (the ones about success and virtue), human\nsocieties value knowledge. Generally, as someone gains more\nknowledge, they ascend in social status. The two are not always\ntied, of course. Some smart people lack social status, and some\npeople with high social status don\u2019t know very much. But,\non the whole, there is a connection between the two that has WHAT WAS FRANCIS BACON TALKING ABOUT? | 17\nexisted over the long course of human history. Having higher\nsocial status means having more power. And so it follows that\nknowledge is power since having it gives someone greater social\nauthority and privileges.\nThese three common benefits of knowledge\u2014success, virtue,\nand social authority\u2014are important to keep in mind as we\nexplore knowledge philosophically. Some philosophers have\ntreated knowledge as if it were in a vacuum, as if the \u201cpower\ndimension\u201d of knowledge could be safely ignored. But such\nan approach leads to an impoverished understanding of the\ncharacter of knowledge and its importance. We need to\nconsider also what is getting done when people are making\nclaims to knowledge or accusing others of not having\nknowledge.\nWe might consider an analogy. Imagine a society in which\npeople generally made judgments about whether certain\naction were \u201cpure.\u201d The people in this society who perform\npure actions are highly respected, receive medals, lead parades,\nand so on. Those who perform impure actions are shunned\nand sometimes imprisoned. We would want to know a lot\nmore about what \u201cpure\u201d means and whether there was\nanything to it\u2014meaning whether there really was such a 18 | WHAT WAS FRANCIS BACON TALKING ABOUT?\nquality as \u201cpure\u201d or whether it was simply imagined by people\nand perhaps motivated by a desire to raise some people up and\npush others down. This is a good question to have in mind\nas we explore knowledge. Is there really anything to it? Or is\nit a social device for putting people into favored or disfavored\ngroups? Of course we think that knowledge is necessarily\nconnected to truth. But at the same time, we know how hard it\nis to be sure a claim, especially an important claim, is true.\nGiven the power dimension of knowledge, it would be\nmarvelous if we had some clear, impartial method for\ndetermining what is true and what is known. 4.\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER\n1. Suppose Marcelo says that he knows the moon is made\nof green cheese. You ask for his justification, and he says\nthat he works in a cheese shop and so he knows cheese\nwhen he sees it. Thus, he knows that the moon is made\nof green cheese. You want to show Marcelo that he\u2019s\nwrong, but in looking things up, you find a credible\narticle in Nature claiming that, in fact, there is evidence\nof trace elements of green cheese in lunar soil. Now what\ndo you say to Marcelo?\n2. Petra adds 59,086 and 63,212 and gets 122,398. She is\nobsessive about such things, so she checks six times and\ngets the same answer each time. Why is she wrong to say\nshe knows that 59,086 plus 63,212 equals 122,398? Once\nyou have answered this question, consider this one: how\nmany times did you check the calculation? How do you\nknow that Petra is wrong?\n3. Imagine encountering a society that has built rocket 20 | QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER\nships, atomic clocks, and X-ray machines. But when you\ntalk with their scientists, they believe they are harnessing\nthe spirits of demons locked inside in the earth, and their\nscience textbooks look completely different from our\nscience textbooks. Put the following responses in order\nfrom \u201cleast plausible\u201d to \u201cmost plausible\u201d:\n1. These people believe false things, and they have\nunknowingly built some very impressive devices.\n2. These people believe things which seem false, but if\nwe studied their beliefs more carefully, we would\nfind that they have the same science we have, but\nexpressed in wildly different terms.\n3. What these people believe is just as true as what we\nbelieve, and their science is radically different from\nours; the two sciences are not merely the same\nknowledge expressed in different terms (so #2 is\nfalse).\nExplain your ranking. 5.\nFURTHER READING\nOnline encyclopedias such as the Internet Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and\nWikipedia offer overviews of philosophical problems and\ntheories regarding knowledge. There are also many\nintroductory texts, including:\nCharles Landesman, An Introduction to Epistemology\n(Wiley-Blackwell, 1996)\nRobert Martin, Epistemology: A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n(Oneworld, 2010)\nJennifer Nagel, Knowledge: A Very Short Introduction\n(Oxford, 2014)\nThe story of Molly and Doug and the burned-out light bulb\nis known as a \u201cGettier Problem,\u201d named for Edmund Gettier\nand an article he published in 1963. The Gettier Problem led\nto a great number of papers providing new JTB+ accounts 22 | FURTHER READING\nor raising new problems to the new accounts. To get a sense\nfor this extensive literature, you can simply search for \u201cGettier\nProblem\u201d on the internet.\nA very good general account of Gettier problems, and how\nthey just won\u2019t go away, is Linda Zagzebski, \u201cThe\nInescapability of Gettier Problems,\u201d The Philosophical\nQuarterly, vol. 44, no. 174 (Jan., 1994), pp. 65-73. PART II\n2. SKEPTICISM: A\nDIALOGUE\n\u201cSkepticism relieved two terrible diseases that\nafflicted mankind: anxiety and dogmatism.\u201d\n\u2014 Sextus Empiricus (c. 200 CE)\nPatient: Help me, doctor! I know too much!\nDoctor: Goodness me, what a curious complaint! But don\u2019t\nworry. We\u2019ll get it sorted out. Here, have a half-full glass of\nwater, or what at least has all the properties of normal water.\nI have put a straw in it. Isn\u2019t it curious how it appears to be\nbroken at the water line?\nPatient: (slurps) Ah, thank you.\nDoctor: Now why is it you think you know too much? 24 | 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE\nPatient: I\u2019m afraid I shall have to be immodest, if you are\nto understand my problem. I am insatiably curious and am\nalways reading about science, history, politics, economics,\nliterature, philosophy, and, well, everything. I have a fantastic\nmind: I understand things very quickly and make astute\nconnections among the things I learn. And I rarely forget\nanything I have read.\nDoctor: Wow!\nPatient: And if I am honest, I must say I have the most logical\nmind I\u2019ve ever encountered. I draw inferences like nobody\u2019s\nbusiness! I have been busy over the last few years writing a\nlong book which I am titling The Encyclopedia of All Human\nKnowledge. And, well, not to brag, but just to tell you how\nthings are, I am certainly the person to write it, for there are\nvery few things that belong in an encyclopedia that I don\u2019t\nalready know.\nDoctor: I must say, you certainly are a rara avis, which\nmeans\u2014 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE | 25\nPatient: \u201cRare bird,\u201d coming from Juvenal\u2019s sixth satire in\nwhich a good wife is said to be as rare as a black swan.\nDoctor: I didn\u2019t know that! You do indeed know a lot. But\nsuch broad knowledge would be a wonderful thing to possess.\nAnything you can think to ask yourself, you can answer.\nAnytime you feel a bit of wonder, you can offer an explanation.\nWith such knowledge you can answer anything! Why on earth\ndo you regard it as a problem?\nPatient: I am bored out of my head! I have written half of\nthe encyclopedia, but I can\u2019t possibly go on, since I already\nknow everything I\u2019m going to say. What\u2019s the point? You must\nunderstand, doctor, that learning new things is my greatest\ndelight. But now I know too much, and there\u2019s nothing for me\nto learn! Oh, how I wish there were something for me to learn!\n(breaks down in tears)\nDoctor: There, there! Here, dry your tears on this\nhandkerchief, which is either white or blue, depending on how\nyou look at it. I see your problem, and though I have not run 26 | 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE\ninto it before, I think I know how to treat it. What you need,\nmy friend, is a healthy dose of skepticism.\nPatient: Skepticism? But you should be warned, doctor, that I\nnot only know everything, but I also know the explanations for\neverything and all of the justifications. I don\u2019t think skepticism\ncan possibly help!\nDoctor: Well, you may be surprised. In my experience there\nis always some room for doubt. What\u2019s more, I think you will\nfind that if you apply skeptical doubts of the right kind, in the\nappropriate measure, and at the right time, you will be able to\ntranscend your great knowledge and reach a very fine form of\nhappiness.\nPatient: I guess it\u2019s worth a shot. I\u2019m miserable now as things\nare.\nDoctor: Good! Now since you are such an intelligent person, I\nwill teach you seven skeptical doubts which I am sure you will\nbe able to apply as needed. I call them the \u201cseven modes.\u201d 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE | 27\nPatient: Sounds good. But I doubt that this will help!\nDoctor: See, you are making progress already! The first mode\nhas to do with history. You say you are writing an\nencyclopedia?\nPatient: Yes, the most comprehensive and accurate\nencyclopedia ever written, if I may say so myself!\nDoctor: Will your encyclopedia include a history of\nencyclopedias?\nPatient: Well, yes, I suppose it must.\nDoctor: So then you will include the great, long tradition\nof encyclopedia writing. You will include Gregor Reisch\u2019s\nMargarita Philosophica of 1496, and Paul Scalich\u2019s 1559\nencyclopedia, and of course the wonderful Cyclopaedia 28 | 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE\nEphraim Chambers published in 1728 which led to the French\nEncyclop\u00e9die which led to the Encyclopedia Britannica. But\nyour encyclopedia will improve upon all of these, will it not?\nPatient: Immeasurably!\nDoctor: But the funny thing is that each of the authors of\nthese older works also thought they were having the final say\nand that they were improving immeasurably upon the\nencyclopedias of the past. Why do you think you are better off\nin this regard?\nPatient: Well, they were all smart people for their time, but I\nknow more than they did then.\nDoctor: But would they not have said the very same thing?\nPatient: I guess so. 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE | 29\nDoctor: And they were wrong by our lights. But what should\nwe conclude from this evidence? Doesn\u2019t history suggest that\nwriters of encyclopedia always take themselves to have\nknowledge and (at least so far) have always been wrong about\nthat?\nPatient: That does seem to be the case.\nDoctor: Good! So that is the first mode. The second mode\nhas to do with culture. All of those encyclopedias I mentioned,\nthe ones by Reisch and Scalich and Chambers, were written by\nwestern Europeans, were they not?\nPatient: Yes. Reisch was born in W\u00fcrttemberg in 1467 and\nwent to\u2014\nDoctor: Hold on now, the point\u2019s been made! They were\nEuropeans. But it would be very surprising, would it not, if\nthere were not also encyclopedias written in many other lands\nsuch as China and India and Egypt. 30 | 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE\nPatient: Yes! Why, in China, the 1726 Chinese Collection of\nPictures and Writing\u2014\nDoctor: Yes, yes, exactly! But these other encyclopedias no\ndoubt had very different entries and very different explanations\nowing to the different cultures and languages and religions and\nphilosophies and systems of science. And yet all of these non-\nEuropean writers of encyclopedias also took themselves to be\ngiving the final say and improving immeasurably upon every\nother effort.\nPatient: Yes, I suppose so.\nDoctor: And, within their own cultural contexts, they had as\nmuch reason to take themselves to have superior knowledge as\nyou do now in your culture. Am I wrong?\nPatient: No, you are right. They thought they knew\neverything\u2014though their \u201ceverything\u201d was not the same 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE | 31\n\u201ceverything\u201d that the European writers took themselves to\nknow.\nDoctor: So that is something to consider: whether any person\nbound to a single culture can really be said to know everything.\nOr even anything! For wouldn\u2019t anything you claim to know\nbe understood quite differently by someone from a very\ndifferent culture?\nPatient: Yes, I guess that would be true. Every culture has a\ndifferent way of understanding things, and to the extent they\ndon\u2019t square up with one another, it\u2019s hard to be confident\nabout what one culture claims to know.\nDoctor: Onward, then, to the third mode which concerns\nyour own brain.\nPatient: And a very fine brain it is!\nDoctor: One of the very best, I agree! Consider the 32 | 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE\nunimaginably long history that has brought about your brain.\nThe long process of evolution from bacteria to vertebrates\nincluding fishes and reptiles and mammals and, eventually,\nhumans, took millions and millions of years. And it was no\nsmooth process, as you know. There were plenty of failed starts\nand extinctions along the way, and plenty of accidents, both\nlucky and unlucky, that led to things being the way they are\ntoday.\nPatient: Yes, I know this well! I have several insightful entries\non evolutionary history.\nDoctor: I\u2019m sure you do. And so I am also sure you realize\nthat our brains did not develop for the sole purpose of gaining\nknowledge. Our cognitive set up had to be just good enough\nto allow our ancestors to reproduce before dying. And that\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily require an organ that is excellent at\nknowing. It only requires an organ that isn\u2019t a total disaster, at\nleast in the department of making babies.\nPatient: I hadn\u2019t heard it put that way, but you\u2019re right.\nEvolution just selects for reproductive fitness, not necessarily\nfor epistemic fitness. 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE | 33\nDoctor: Exactly. So that means that, for our knowledge, we are\nrelying on an organ that wasn\u2019t exactly evolved for being good\nat knowing. We would be skeptical of the use of any device that\nwasn\u2019t designed for the purpose we\u2019re using it for, wouldn\u2019t\nwe? So shouldn\u2019t we be skeptical of our own brains when it\ncomes to knowing things?\nPatient: I guess so \u2026 hey, wait a minute! It\u2019s our brains that\nare telling us this! Our brains figured out evolution by natural\nselection\u2014well, Charles Darwin\u2019s brain figured it out, at any\nrate\u2014and our brains have deduced these skeptical\nconsequences. So don\u2019t we have to trust our brains in order to\nnot trust our brains?!\nDoctor: Now you\u2019re getting that hang of it! It\u2019s hard to know\nwhat to believe, isn\u2019t it?\nPatient: I feel dizzy. 34 | 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE\nDoctor: Here, have another sip of this stuff that certainly\nseems to be water. Now let\u2019s turn to the fourth mode which is\nrelated to what we were just talking about. I call it the animals\nand aliens mode. Human brains evolved in ways that have\nended up helping human beings lead human lives, right? But\nthe same is true for ape brains, dolphin brains, elephant brains,\neven frog brains\u2014each species evolved brains that suit the lives\nthose species live.\nPatient: Yes, it\u2019s the same story across the board.\nDoctor: And there is so much interesting variation! Think\nabout bats with their echolocation, or how pit vipers can see\nheat. And did you know that, while we have only three sorts\nof photoreceptors in our eyes, mantis shrimp have as many as\nsixteen different kinds?\nPatient: Indeed! They can see deep ultraviolet light, as well as\nfar red light, and polarized light.\nDoctor: Just think about the sorts of encyclopedias these 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE | 35\nanimals would write! What they experience is so different from\nwhat humans experience, but their experience is just as valid,\nwouldn\u2019t you agree?\nPatient: Sure. In many cases, the animals experience much\nmore than we do.\nDoctor: And I presume you are familiar with all of the\narguments suggesting that there almost certainly is life\nelsewhere in the universe.\nPatient: Of course! There must be, given how enormous the\nuniverse is. It is statistically quite certain that life has evolved\non countless other planets.\nDoctor: Some of those aliens have probably written\nencyclopedias as well! And in all likelihood, those aliens would\nhave evolved in very different ways from any life on earth. So\nwhat they would claim to know would be even more different\nthan what our own bats and vipers and mantis shrimp would\nclaim to know. 36 | 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE\nPatient: Yes, it would be impossible for us to conceive what\nthey would think they knew.\nDoctor: But there is no reason to think any less of them for\nthat, is there?\nPatient: Of course not! Okay, okay, I see the point: animals\nand aliens would have knowledge that is radically different\nfrom human knowledge, and every bit as valid, if not more so,\nwhich means human knowledge cannot be the be-all and end-\nall.\nDoctor: I could not have said it better myself! Are you ready\nfor the fifth mode?\nPatient: It is hard to believe there\u2019s even more doubts to\nconsider! 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE | 37\nDoctor: You can be sure of it! Set aside the last two doubts\nabout our brains and the brains of animals and aliens. Suppose\nwe could assure ourselves that our brains are in fact excellent\ntrackers of truth. Still, a person as educated as you must surely\nrealize that there is hardly anything to put into an encyclopedia\nthat isn\u2019t contradicted by some other expert somewhere?\nPatient: Don\u2019t I know it! You know, as a hobby I routinely\ncorrect entries on Wikipedia, and boy have I gotten into\nfights\u2014sometimes even over the most trivial things!\nDoctor: It seems like there is no bit of knowledge that isn\u2019t\ncontested by someone. But often, that someone has some\nreasons for raising their objections, especially if the matter has\nbig consequences. No one cares much about the exact\ntemperature outside the Poughkeepsie courthouse at noon,\nbut start talking about raising the minimum wage, and hoo boy!\nPatient: Yes sir!\nDoctor: So, it would seem, on a great many matters, experts 38 | 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE\ndisagree. And we know from the first mode, the one based\non history, that experts can be very wrong. So if experts, who\ndedicate much of their careers to understanding important\nthings, can disagree with one another, and may well be shown\nto be wrong later on, then what hope for getting things right\ndo the rest of us have?\nPatient: Not much. I mean, I know how hard it is to be an\nexpert since I am one on nearly everything. But there are always\npeople disagreeing with me, and sometimes, if I\u2019m honest, I\u2019m\nnot sure they\u2019re wrong!\nDoctor: Interesting, isn\u2019t it, that experts, who represent the\nhighest knowledge a human can have on a topic, end up\nserving as a reason for being skeptical, even about that very\ntopic!\nPatient: Well, only because experts so often disagree! It makes\nit hard for a nonexpert to know what to believe or whom to\ntrust. 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE | 39\nDoctor: Exactly. So let us consider next the sixth mode which\nis based on logic.\nPatient: Aha! I am an expert logician!\nDoctor: So I gather! And where did you learn logic?\nPatient: I attended a very fine school in Des Moines.\nDoctor: Des Moines? And where is that?\nPatient: In Iowa!\nDoctor: And where is that?\nPatient: In the United States, of course. 40 | 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE\nDoctor: And where is that?\nPatient: Is this a trick? It\u2019s in North America. And before you\nask, that\u2019s on planet Earth, in the solar system, in the Milky\nWay galaxy!\nDoctor: And where\u2014\nPatient: In the Virgo Cluster, which is in the Laniakea\nSupercluster, which is in the universe!\nDoctor: Good! And where is the universe?\nPatient: What sort of silly question is that?! No one can\nanswer that! 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE | 41\nDoctor: Ah, so you don\u2019t know where you learned logic.\nPatient: Uh \u2026 what???\nDoctor: I\u2019m just having some fun with you, of course, calling\nto your attention the idea of a regress, which is a long chain of\nquestions either without an end or with a big question mark\nat the end. A regress suggests that if you can\u2019t answer the long\nchain of questions, you don\u2019t really have knowledge of what\u2019s\nat the tail end of it. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s relevant to your case. Didn\u2019t\nyou say earlier that you not only knew everything, but also all\nof the explanations and justifications for everything?\nPatient: Yes, I did say that! Though now I\u2019m becoming less\nsure \u2026\nDoctor: So, if I asked you about something you know\u2014let\u2019s\nsay, about some event in the War of 1812\u2014you could tell me\nabout the event, and you would be able to give me evidence for\nbelieving what you do about that event? 42 | 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE\nPatient: Yes, I would! I am very scrupulous.\nDoctor: And so then, you could give me reasons to believe that\nevidence? Evidence for the evidence, so to speak?\nPatient: I think so \u2026 well, to some extent\u2026\nDoctor: And evidence for the evidence for the evidence?\nPatient: Hold on! Explanations have to stop somewhere!\nDoctor: But where? With things for which you have no\nevidence?\nPatient: Well, yes, I mean, I guess so\u2026 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE | 43\nDoctor: But this means everything you believe is ultimately\nbased on things for which you have no evidence!\nPatient: Just because there\u2019s no evidence for something\ndoesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t believe it!\nDoctor: Come again?\nPatient: Well, just because I have no reason to believe them\ndoesn\u2019t mean I have no reason to believe \u2026 uh, wait a minute.\nI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m saying \u2026.\nDoctor: Excellent! See? Your swelling of knowledge is already\ngoing down!\nPatient: I feel everything slipping away \u2026\nDoctor: Isn\u2019t it a nice feeling? All those things you thought 44 | 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE\nyou knew and had to keep track of and worry about are all\nslipping away. No knowledge, no worries! This is the perfect\npoint at which to tell you about the seventh mode, my\nfavorite, which I call the forever open alternative.\nPatient: What\u2019s that?\nDoctor: All the doubts we have been through have had\nsomething in common: they have all indicated that there could\nwell be something we hadn\u2019t thought of. Maybe it\u2019s a future\ndiscovery, or the discovery by another culture, or by animals\nor aliens, or something our brain isn\u2019t picking up, or some\nfurther question we hadn\u2019t thought to ask. The forever open\nalternative is the general possibility that there is something\nimportant we haven\u2019t considered yet. Who knows why! The\nworld is such a big, complicated place, and we are so tiny and\nlive such short lives that it would be incredible if there weren\u2019t\nextra complications we have not considered!\nPatient: That seems unavoidable. It\u2019s always possible that\nthings are more complicated in ways we have not even\nimagined! 2. SKEPTICISM: A DIALOGUE | 45\nDoctor: Yes, and maybe we can\u2019t even see the ways in which\nthey are more complicated! The forever open alternative is\nsimply the recognition that we may not know as much as we\nthink we do. It\u2019s the essence of skepticism, really. There\u2019s\nalways an open possibility that we just don\u2019t really know what\nwe think we know.\nPatient: Doctor, I think you have cured me! I feel like I can\ndiminish my confidence in everything I used to believe!\nDoctor: Glad to hear it! You will learn through experience\nwhich mode to use in each case, since some will be more\neffective than others, depending on what you are doubting.\nBut if you apply yourself, you find you are able to place\nyourself in a blissful state of not knowing. You will balance\nyourself between each claim and its denial, neither affirming\nnor rejecting either one, but floating above them all. And that,\nmy friend, is a happy state of mind!  6.\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER\n1. Consider the following five alleged facts. How would\nyou go about doubting them? Feel free to make use of\nthe doctor\u2019s seven modes if they are useful.\n1. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee is much nicer\nthan the aroma of an angry skunk.\n2. It is impossible for a human being to levitate using\nonly their own powers.\n3. Two plus seven equals nine.\n4. Canada is larger than India.\n5. The total entropy of an isolated system can never\ndecrease over time and is constant if and only if all\nprocesses are reversible. (This is called \u201cthe second\nlaw of thermodynamics.\u201d)\n2. It is sometimes said that the Academic Skeptics believed\nthat nothing can be known, but the Pyrrhonian Skeptics\ndoubted even this. Which group do you think is more\nskeptical? Justify your answer. 48 | QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER\n3. It seems very odd to say, \u201cI know X, but I\u2019m not sure of\nit.\u201d (Try out some examples.) But did anything in the\nJTB+ account of knowledge suggest that knowledge\nrequires being sure of something? Why does it seem odd\nto us to say we are not sure of the things we think we\nknow? Or does it? 7.\nFURTHER READING\nSextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism. Sextus was a\nphysician in ancient times. He recommended skepticism as a\nway of attaining peace of mind (ataraxia), and his book was\nmeant as a guide. A useful summary of his views can be found\nalso on Wikipedia.\nPeter Unger, Ignorance: A Case for Skepticism (Oxford, 1979)\nprovides more contemporary arguments in favor of\nskepticism.  PART III\n3. THE GRAND\nDECEPTION DOUBT\n(OR, THE GDD)\nConsider this possibility from the philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n(1596-1650):\n\u201cNevertheless, the belief that there is a God who is all\npowerful, and who created me, such as I am, has, for a long\ntime, obtained steady possession of my mind. How, then,\ndo I know that he has not arranged that there should be\nneither earth, nor sky, nor any extended thing, nor figure,\nnor magnitude, nor place, providing at the same time,\nhowever, for the rise in me of the perceptions of all these\nobjects, and the persuasion that these do not exist\notherwise than as I perceive them? And further, as I\nsometimes think that others are in error respecting matters\nof which they believe themselves to possess a perfect\nknowledge, how do I know that I am not also deceived each\ntime I add together two and three, or number the sides of 52 | 3. THE GRAND DECEPTION DOUBT (OR, THE GDD)\na square, or form some judgment still more simple, if more\nsimple indeed can be imagined?\u201d1\nWe might reformulate Descartes\u2019s doubt into a set of steps\nas follows:\n1. Everything I believe about the world is based on what\nhas come to me either through my senses (what I have\nseen, read, heard, or experienced), or through my own\npower of thought.\n2. It seems to me there could be a being, like God, who has\npower over what I sense and even has power over my\nown power of thought.\n3. If God wanted to, he could make it seem like I am\nperceiving something when really I\u2019m not, and God\ncould make me think something must be true when\nreally it isn\u2019t.\n4. I cannot know for certain that God isn\u2019t deceiving me in\nthese ways.\n1. Rene Descartes, \u201cFirst Meditation,\u201d in Meditations on First Philosophy (translated\nby John Veitch, 1902). 3. THE GRAND DECEPTION DOUBT (OR, THE GDD) | 53\n5. So I really cannot be certain about anything I believe\nabout the world.\nCall this \u201cthe Grand Deception Doubt,\u201d or the GDD, for\nshort. If you prefer not to bring God into arguments like this,\nconsider replacing God with a very powerful demon or some\nmad scientist who has captured you, removed your brain, and\nput it into a jar with a bunch of wires connecting it to a\nsupercomputer which gives the scientist complete control over\nwhat you think you perceive and what you think you think.\nIs there any way to refute the GDD? No, not really. But let\u2019s\nsee why. To refute it, we would need some way to \u201cdefuse\u201d it\nand show that, in fact, we could not be experiencing such a\nmassive and thorough deception. Our first move might be to\npoint out that it would just be too impractical for some god,\nor some demon, or some mad scientist with a lot of advanced\ntechnology, to accomplish such a deception. Who could have\nthe power to do such a thing? Why would they want to do\nit? What advantage would they have in deceiving us so\nthoroughly? But the answer to all of these questions is the\nsame: \u201cWho knows?\u201d That is to say, we do not know what\nmotivates gods and demons and mad scientists, and for all we\ndo know, they might have very good reasons for deceiving us.\nMaybe they are competing in a cosmic contest. Maybe the 54 | 3. THE GRAND DECEPTION DOUBT (OR, THE GDD)\nGDD is cheaper than creating an actual universe. Maybe they\nare teaching us a lesson. Maybe they are malicious. Maybe,\nmaybe, maybe. For all we know, the skeptic will say, there\nmight be a powerful demon with both means, motivation, and\nopportunity to deceive us. So long as we cannot rule that out,\nwe cannot be certain of the truth of what we experience.\nNext effort. We might point out that this is crazy talk, and\nnormal people don\u2019t go around worrying about the possibility\nof a GDD. But the skeptic will respond that the fact that\n\u201cnormal people\u201d don\u2019t worry about something does not in any\nway show that the thing isn\u2019t true. And\u2014by the way\u2014the\nskeptic will point out that the very existence of these alleged\n\u201cnormal\u201d people is also cast into doubt by the GDD. They\ncould be part of the grand illusion, like non-playable characters\nin a video game.\nOK, let us try a more philosophical approach. We have\nexperiences. The experiences must come from somewhere. We\ncould believe that they come from what they seem to come\nfrom\u2014namely, a real world with other people and animals\nand trees and buildings and so on. Or we could believe they\ncome from some radically different source\u2014a god or demon\nor mad scientist. It is more rational to adopt the simpler and 3. THE GRAND DECEPTION DOUBT (OR, THE GDD) | 55\nmost straightforward explanation which is that experiences are\ncoming from what they seem to be coming from. Therefore, it\nis rational to reject the GDD.\nThis is a much better sort of reply. For one thing, it uses words\nlike \u201crational\u201d and \u201ctherefore,\u201d so it seems very philosophical!\nBut is it enough of a reply? No, it isn\u2019t. It makes two highly\nquestionable assumptions. The first is that our ordinary view,\nthat our experiences come from a real world, is simpler than\nthe view that our experience comes from some other source.\nBut why should the ordinary view count as \u201csimpler\u201d? It\u2019s\nmore common (or seems to be), but \u201ccommon\u201d does not mean\nthe same as \u201csimpler.\u201d The fact that the view is more common\ncould be entirely accidental. If we were all taught that\nexperience comes directly from an eggplant in the heavens,\nthen that belief would be more common, but we should not\non that account take it to be more likely true.\nThe second questionable assumption is that it is more rational\nto believe the simpler and most straightforward explanation.\nBut why should we believe this principle is true? Is it because\nwe know the world to follow rational rules and principles?\nWhy must this be true? I might believe that the world would\nbe a more rational place if people shared their surplus wealth 56 | 3. THE GRAND DECEPTION DOUBT (OR, THE GDD)\nwith others who needed it, but it does not follow that the\nworld is as I believe it rationally should be. Why should this\ncase be any different?\nAt this point someone might throw up their arms and insist,\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter! You can raise all the skeptical scenarios\nyou like, but in the end we are all going to keep believing the\nordinary view of things!\u201d Most skeptics would agree. People\nwill continue to believe what people will continue to believe.\nThe skeptic\u2019s point is merely that people do not have good\nreason for believing what they believe, and if people claim they\ndo, they are mistaken.\nThis puts us in a somewhat awkward position. Is it true that\nwe don\u2019t have good reason for believing what we believe? Is\nit no more rational to believe the claims of scientists and\nhistorians than to believe that all our experience comes from\nan eggplant in the heavens? 8.\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER\n1. Suppose some event indicated that you really were living\nin a GDD situation. Suppose, for example, a pop-up\nscreen entered your visual field in real life and notified\nyou that you are living in a simulation. How would your\nlife change\u2014if at all? Explain.\n2. Our senses give us a misleading picture of the world, and\nnews media oversimplify and exaggerate events. At any\nmoment some high number of our beliefs are false\n(though we don\u2019t know which ones). But these facts do\nnot ordinarily trouble us. Does the GDD add anything\nnew that is especially troubling? Or should we be more\ntroubled than we typically are about ordinary life?\n3. \u201cThe GDD refutes itself. For if we were in a GDD\nsituation, then our ability to conceive of demons, mad\nscientists, or even God is unconnected with whatever\nreality there is. So we cannot trust our ideas about such\nthings, and thus, we cannot trust our idea that the GDD 58 | QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER\nis even possible.\u201d Discuss. 9.\nFURTHER READING\nDescartes\u2019s Meditations on First Philosophy is a classic\nexpression of the GDD, and Descartes\u2019s systematic response to\nit is ingenious if not entirely compelling. Many versions of the\nwork can be found on the internet.\nIt is also interesting to work through a modern expression\nof the GDD in the form of the \u201cSimulation Argument\u201d put\nforward by Nick Bostrom (available online at\nhttps://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html).\nBostrom is not urging skepticism so much as trying to establish\nthat probably we really are living in a simulation. The basic\nidea is that if it is possible for simulated beings to be conscious,\nand if advanced civilizations are likely to run simulations of\nthe universe, then (given the probable populations of such\nsimulated beings) it is more likely than not we are living in a\nsimulation.  PART IV\n4. FIRST ANSWER\nTO THE SKEPTIC\nThere are so many good reasons to be an extreme skeptic.\nThere are the seven modes offered by the skeptical doctor in\nthe earlier dialogue, and the Grand Deception Doubt (GDD),\nand just the routine experience of being wrong, which\nhappens to everyone, and which could happen to anyone with\nregard to everything, it seems. And yet hardly anyone is really\nthis skeptical. Why is this? Do we have good reasons for not\nbeing skeptics? Or are we just proud and stubborn and\nunwilling to think we might be wrong about everything?\nAfter expressing the GDD, Ren\u00e9 Descartes went on to try to\nrefute it. He wanted to show how to organize our knowledge\nso that everything is based upon secure principles and we\nwould be free from skeptical doubts. He did this by\nestablishing one thing he could never be wrong about: namely,\nthat he existed as a thinking thing. \u201cI think, therefore I am,\u201d he\nsaid. He was not sure whether he had a body, or whether there\nwere other people in the world, but he knew that he could not\nbe wrong about his own existence. This insight of Descartes\u2019s 62 | 4. FIRST ANSWER TO THE SKEPTIC\nis called \u201cthe cogito\u201d since in Latin he would have said \u201cCogito,\nergo sum.\u201d\nWhat made him so sure? Ultimately, he found he could not\nmake sense of any way of being wrong about his own existence.\nYou may try to prove this to yourself. Try to imagine some\nsituation in which you do not exist but are somehow deceived\ninto believing that you do exist. It is impossible, for you would\nhave to exist in some fashion in order to be deceived about\nanything! If you are not convinced, then try this experiment:\ngrab something that doesn\u2019t exist, and then try to trick it into\nbelieving that it does exist. Any success?\nBut if this first insight is secure, it is hard to know what to\ndo next. Descartes goes on to argue for God\u2019s existence and\nthat God is not malevolent and that God would not deceive\nus about things that seem to us to be clearly and distinctly\ntrue, and before you know it, he has built an entire system of\nknowledge upon his cogito foundation. Readers generally do\nnot find his arguments compelling. But they like the cogito. It\nseems like the one definitive claim philosophers have been able\nto prove! 4. FIRST ANSWER TO THE SKEPTIC | 63\nIn this chapter, we will explore another way someone might try\nto answer the skeptic, and in the next chapter we will explore\na second way. The first way requires us to be content with a\nsystem of knowledge that is based upon what appears to be\ntrue.  10.\nKNOWLEDGE OF\nAPPEARANCES, OR\nPHENOMENALISM\nThe skeptics who offer the GDD claim that, for all we know,\neverything we ever sense could be an illusion. One way to reply\nto these skeptics is to call their bluff. So what if everything\nis an illusion? We still have to deal with appearances. We still\nhave to get up in the morning, do our exercises, go to work,\ndeal with people, solve problems, pay taxes, and die. Does it\nreally matter whether what we are experiencing is only a very\nthorough illusion? What practical difference would this make\nin our lives?\nThis response to the skeptic maintains that we can get all the\nknowledge we shall ever need through a careful study of\nappearances, and we should never have to insist that these\nappearances come from some \u201cexternal\u201d world (meaning, a\nworld external to the appearances). The task, then, is to show\nthat we really can get everything we need from mere 66 | KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM\nappearances. The efforts to show this are sometimes called\n\u201cempirical idealism\u201d or \u201cphenomenalism,\u201d and such efforts\nhave been made by George Berkeley (1685-1753), Ernst Mach\n(1838-1916), Bertrand Russell (1872-1970), and Rudolf\nCarnap (1891-1970), among others. We will sketch a similar\neffort in this section.\nWe can begin this project by thinking through what we would\nhave to do if we wanted to create a very compelling virtual\nreality machine. With such a machine, you can strap on\ngoggles or a helmet and be treated with the sights and sounds\nof another world\u2014a Martian landscape, Middle Earth, ancient\nRome, or whatever you like. But we want our VR machine to\nbe much more thorough. We want not only sights and sounds,\nbut smells and textures and tastes. We want to feel the ground\nbeneath our feet, and we want to experience the difficulty of\nwalking up steep hills. We want the world to be wide open\nso that no matter where we decide to turn or run or jump or\ncrouch, the machine will respond with the appropriate set of\nimages and features for us to experience. We want the real in\nour virtual to seem as real as our real in the real. (By the way,\nisn\u2019t that an interesting sentence?)\nLet\u2019s think through what this requires by taking up a specific KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM | 67\nexample. Let\u2019s say I am in the VR of ancient Rome, and I am\ngoing to walk up to a statue and examine it from all angles.\nObviously, the statue that I am looking at does not exist in\nthe real world. In the VR, I am presented with images that\nshow how a real statue would look from all possible angles. I\nwalk around the sculpture, and I am presented with a series of\nimages of the sculpture, smoothly transitioning from one to\nthe next. I lay down on the ground, and I see an image of the\nstatue from below. But, again, there is no statue\u2014not really.\nAll that exists is a very extensive set of images produced by the\nVR program. I experience three sets of images similar to one\nanother but also different which together \u201csuggest\u201d that there\nis an object \u201cout there\u201d that corresponds to the sets of images I\nexperience. 68 | KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM\nOf course, in a VR situation, there is no \u201cstatue in itself\u201d\nexcept as a collection of images included in a number of\n\u201cperspectives.\u201d We pretend that there is a \u201cstatue in itself,\u201d\nthough we only see the images from one perspective or\nanother. Image F is very similar to image F\u2019, which is very\nsimilar to F\u2019\u2019, but they are all subtly different from one another\nin such a way to suggest the illusion that we are moving around\na stable, fixed object (\u201cthe statue\u201d) which does not really exist.\nSetting this up requires a lot of thought and a lot of\ncoordination, though there is no reason to think it cannot be\ndone. It just requires a lot of planning in how the images are\nconstructed and the order in which they are viewed.\nTo make the sort of VR we are imagining, this sort of\nconstruction would have to take place for each and every\nvirtual object and for all of the angles from which the virtual\n\u201cobject\u201d could be seen. Similar sorts of programming would\nhave to be done for every sound and smell and taste. Imagine\nhaving to program just how a virtual orange would taste after\nbiting a virtual lemon as opposed to how it would taste just\nafter brushing your virtual teeth! Imagine having to program\njust how the smell of some virtual old socks would change as\nyou became used to the smell. KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM | 69\n\u201cHold on,\u201d I imagine someone thinking. \u201cWhat do you mean\nby my \u2018virtual\u2019 teeth? Can\u2019t I use my real teeth?\u201d No, you can\u2019t.\nFor in the VR we are imagining, we will have to present you\nwith images of your (virtual) feet if you look down at them,\nimages of your (virtual) eyes if you look into a (virtual) mirror.\nWe shall even have to present you with images of your (virtual)\nbrain if you decide to do brain surgery on yourself. Basically,\nall of the sensory images you experience\u2014indeed, all sensations\nwhatsoever, whether of yourself or other things\u2014will have to\nbe generated from the VR programming. Plugging into this\nVR system means leaving the so-called real world behind and\nexperiencing only the sights, sounds, tastes, textures, smells,\nand other features of the virtual world. And that will include\nthe sensations of your own body.\nI keep pointing out that the \u2018objects\u2019 in the virtual world don\u2019t\nreally exist. That is to say, they do not exist in the normal way\nwe take ordinary objects in our ordinary reality to exist. But\nthere may be another sense in which they do exist: they exist as\ncomplicated structures within the VR program. For example,\nI might say that the statue\u2019s left elbow just is the set of F, F\u2019,\nand F\u2019\u2019 that relate to one another in the way described above.\nThe same, of course, for the head and for the left knee. What\ngroups them together as images of the left elbow, or the left\nknee, or the head, is that the images share a certain structure,\nor have great similarities to one another, and the images change 70 | KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM\nsmoothly from one to another according to general rules that\nhold for any observer who is \u201cwalking around the statue\u201d in\nthe same way we are.\nHopefully, we have spent enough time thinking through this\nexample to have a solid sense of what is being proposed under\nthe names \u201cempirical idealism\u201d or \u201cphenomenalism.\u201d These\nphilosophical views assert that our real world is in fact like\nthe virtual reality we have been thinking about. There are no\nmaterial objects existing \u201cout there\u201d for us to experience. There\nare only the sensations we experience, organized in the way a\nvery advanced VR would be programmed so as to generate the\nappearance of a world of objects. Really, when we refer to the\nEiffel Tower or the pyramids of Egypt, we are referring to all\nof the perceptions one might experience when one undergoes\nthe actions that initiate certain sequences of perceptions we\nassociate with \u201cexperiencing the Eiffel Tower\u201d or \u201cexperiencing\nthe pyramids.\u201d Only experiences exist. And this includes the\nexperiences of our own bodies for the reasons given above. We\nexperience our bodies through our senses, or through images\nin mirrors or recordings, but these also are just experiences and\nnot different in kind from the statues and towers and pyramids\nwe can experience. KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM | 71\nNormally (when we are not doing philosophy), we believe\nsomething like this: there exists a world of objects which cause\nus to have perceptions of those objects. A phenomenalist\ndrops out the world of objects and inserts in its place some\nother cause, or perhaps just a question mark, and keeps\neverything else\u2014all our perceptions\u2014exactly as it was before.\nObjection: What is the point of working though all\nof these construction details if, in the end, all our\nexperience remains unchanged?\nBut remember why we started this section in the first place.\nWe wanted to find some way to answer the skeptic. The skeptic\nwas asking how we could be sure we were in a real world\ninstead of some sort of virtual reality (caused by demons, mad\nscientists, God, etc.). We called the skeptic\u2019s bluff. That is, our\neffort has been to show that our world could very well be\nvirtual in just the way the skeptic seems worried about, and\nit really would not matter for all of our intents and purposes.\nThe GDD need not bother us.\nIn calling the skeptic\u2019s bluff, we gain some advantages. First,\nall our knowledge is based on things we immediately\nexperience\u2014the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, textures, and\nperceptions of daily life. We could be wrong about what those 72 | KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM\nexperiences are experiences of, but we cannot be wrong about\nthe fact that we have those experiences. And if we base the rest\nof our knowledge just on those experiences, we will have placed\nall our knowledge on a secure foundation, and we can tell the\nskeptic to run along and pester somebody else.\nThere are some interesting further questions we might\nconsider:\n1. If only experiences exist, how am I ever wrong about\nanything?\n2. How can I be sure other people (meaning, other\nconscious minds) exist?\n3. What causes my experiences? Who or what organizes my\nperceptions?\nWe will briefly consider each of these questions in turn.\nBut first I will offer a hint to help you in thinking through\nthe answers to them for yourself. For the phenomenalist, all\nknowledge is rooted in experience. So the answer to any\nquestion will be a question about what our experience is when\nwe ordinarily try to answer those questions. If you want to\nknow how a phenomenalist answers a question, ask yourself\nwhat experiences you have when you try to answer those\nquestions in a more commonsensical context. KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM | 73\nHow am I ever wrong about anything? Well, what happens\nordinarily when we have the unfortunate experience of being\nwrong about something? Perhaps I think that 5 x 7 = 42;\nsomeone takes me slowly through the calculation and shows\nme otherwise. Perhaps I think India is larger than Canada;\nsomeone grabs a globe and asks me to study it more closely.\nPerhaps I think Woodrow Wilson is president; someone shows\nme a recent newspaper that suggests otherwise. Generally,\nwhen we learn we are wrong, we can describe the experience\nof being shown wrong, and once we have the experience of\nbeing shown wrong, we have all the phenomenalist requires to\nanswer the question.\nThis means that truth means something slightly different for\nthe phenomenalist than it does for non-phenomenalists. Non-\nphenomenalists think that we are wrong when what we think\nor say does not match how things really are (where \u201creally are\u201d\nmeans outside of one\u2019s experience). But for the phenomenalist,\nbeing wrong means saying or thinking something that does\nnot match what the rest of experience shows. When someone\nis wrong, their belief is not consistent with a relevant set of\nexperiences (like doing a calculation carefully, studying a\nglobe, or reading a newspaper). This might be seen as a point\nin the phenomenalist\u2019s favor, actually, since that does seem to\nbe what we do when we try to determine whether we are right 74 | KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM\nor wrong: we look to other experiences and see whether our\nbeliefs are consistent with them.\nHow can I be sure other conscious minds exist? Well, once again,\nconsider what experiences suggest to us that other conscious\nminds exist. To the extent that I am sure of the existence of\nother minds, it is because of what other people seem to say or\ndo. On the basis of my interactions with other people, I come\nto believe they have their own thoughts and feelings, and that\nthey have experiences much like my own. If someone presses\nthe objection, asserting that, for all I know, other people could\nbe characters generated by a computer program, or non-\nplayable characters, I may have to admit that this could be\nthe case. I really cannot be sure at a very fundamental level.\nBut who can? This again seems to be a point in the\nphenomenalist\u2019s favor. We should be skeptical of any answer to\na skeptic that promises too much, or promises knowledge that\nwe don\u2019t ordinarily take ourselves to have.\nWhat causes my experience? This question requires special\ntreatment if we think that whatever causes experience has to\nbe something that does not show up in our experience. If we\nthink this, then obviously we cannot examine our ordinary\nexperience to show us how we ordinarily go about answering KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM | 75\nthe question. At first glance, it appears that a phenomenalist\nreally has no compelling answer to offer. Our experience could\nbe coming from a world of spatiotemporal, material objects, or\nit could be coming from a demon, or a mad scientist, or God,\nor some psychedelic eggplant with telepathic powers. There\nis no way of knowing since, for the phenomenalist, all our\nknowledge is based upon experience, and obviously, we do not\nhave any experience of anything outside of experience.\nBut on further thought, we may notice that the phenomenalist\ndoes not need to answer this question. The basis of knowledge,\nfor the phenomenalist, is experience, or data, or \u201cwhat is\ngiven.\u201d What we know we know because it is either present\nin experience or constructed from experience. If someone asks\nus about things that are totally outside of experience, we may\nlegitimately respond, \u201cYou are asking about things of which\nno knowledge is possible.\u201d And no one should expect us to do\nthe impossible! So the question \u201cWhat causes our experience?\u201d\nis something like a meaningless question, like asking whether\ntriangles are married or if the color green is for sale.\nSo phenomenalism has a lot going for it as an answer to the\nskeptic. One might even praise it as the most responsible\napproach to knowledge someone could take, as it forces us to 76 | KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM\nmake sure everything we think we know is connected in clear\nways to what we experience and cautions us against believing\nin anything beyond what experience shows. Yet in my\nexperience, very few people wish to be phenomenalists. In a\nclass of thirty students, I may have one or two who are\ninterested in adopting the view. Strangely, it is because people\nreally like the idea of there being a material world even if it\nlies outside of any possible experience. For most people, it is\nnot enough to believe in the experience of touching a statue\nand feeling its hardness; there must also really be a statue in\naddition to whatever I can possibly experience of the statue.\nI call this \u201cstrange\u201d because it is strange that people should\nfeel so confident about an object that they themselves will\nadmit\u2014at least, after a bit of philosophical discussion\u2014is an\nobject that they can never possibly experience (\u201cthe statue in\nitself\u201d).\nLet us explore the strangeness of this confidence a bit further.\nOrdinarily, before we begin to philosophize, we think that\nthere are objects in the world, and these objects somehow\ncause our experiences of those objects. If we are asked why\nwe believe the objects cause our experience, our general feeling\nis something along the lines of, \u201cWhat, are you crazy? These\nexperiences must come from somewhere! My experiences are\nexperiences of objects.\u201d This attitude is what we may call\n\u201ccommon sense realism.\u201d KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM | 77\nBut now suppose I extend common sense realism a bit\nfurther. I say, \u201cWell, surely you don\u2019t think that is the end of\nthe matter, do you? For these objects must also come from\nsomewhere just as the experiences must come from\nsomewhere. And just as experiences come from objects, I tell\nyou now that objects must come from schmobjects.\u201d 78 | KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM\nAccording to this new view, which we may call \u201cuncommon\nsense realism,\u201d it is not enough to merely claim that objects\ncause our perceptions. We must explain what causes those\nobjects. The cause of those objects is what we should call\nschmobjects, I say. Schmobjects cause objects in exactly the way\nthat objects cause our perceptions of objects.\nIf you ask me why I believe in schmobjects in addition to\nobjects, I shall reply, \u201cWhat, are you crazy? These objects must\ncome from somewhere! Objects are the effects of schmobjects.\u201d\nYou can hardly accuse me of being less rational than the person KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM | 79\nwho made a similar claim about experiences coming from\nobjects.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. Schmobjects can\u2019t just exist by\nthemselves, can they? They must be caused by flobjects. And\nflobjects are caused by globjects. And globjects are \u2026\nAnd off we go in an endless regress to crazyland. We should\ncut off this endless regress somewhere, don\u2019t you think? And\nwouldn\u2019t it be reasonable to cut it off at the point where our\nexperience ends and not go on to assert the existence of things\nof which we have no experience? That would leave us with\nphenomenalism, wouldn\u2019t it?\nBut strangely, most people seem to like to assert the existence\nof objects and don\u2019t feel arbitrary at all in denying the existence\nof schmobjects. What can I say? People are weird.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Figure 4.1 \u00a9 Charlie Huenemann is licensed under a CC\nBY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Figure 4.2 \u00a9 Charlie Huenemann is licensed under a CC 80 | KNOWLEDGE OF APPEARANCES, OR PHENOMENALISM\nBY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Figure 4.3 \u00a9 Charlie Huenemann is licensed under a CC\nBY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license 11.\nPROBLEMS WITH\nPHENOMENALISM\nMany people reject phenomenalism for some strange and\nunconvincing reason. But there are also good lesser-known\nreasons for rejecting phenomenalism. I will sketch two of these\nreasons: the problem of necessary truths, and the problem of\nsense data.\nThe problem of necessary truths is the problem of how\nphenomenalism can account for our knowledge of truths that\nstrike us as necessary truths. This is a bit tricky to explain.\nSome truths seem like just accidental truths about the world.\nGiraffes have long necks. The moa is, sadly, extinct. And here\nis some good news: there are currently more than 5,000 black\nrhinos, which is more than twice as many as there were in\n1995. All of these truths, it seems, could have been otherwise.\nGiraffes could have evolved to have shorter necks, the moa\ncould have survived, and black rhinos could be even more (or\nless) populous than they currently are. Call these truths that 82 | PROBLEMS WITH PHENOMENALISM\ncould have been otherwise contingent truths (\u201ccontingent\u201d\nmeans that they depend on other facts for their truth).\nOther truths in our experience seem more necessary and less\ncontingent. Consider the claim that the earth is gravitationally\nattracted to the sun or that for every action there is an equal\nand opposite reaction. Are these claims true in exactly the same\nway that it happens to be true that giraffes have long necks\nand the moa is extinct and there are more black rhinos than\nbefore? Normally we think of laws of nature as more necessary\nand less changeable than other claims about the world. They\ndescribe what must happen, and not just what happens to have\nresulted. But what in our experience could make these truths\nmore necessary?\nThe mere fact that we do not come across exceptions to the\nlaws of nature does not show they are more necessary. We also\nnever come across short-necked giraffes or existent moas or\nherds of a million black rhinos, but that does not show that\nthere could not be such things. Indeed, it is hard to imagine the\nnecessity of a truth being somehow apparent in our experience.\nWould it glow somehow or have a warning sticker on it telling\nus that this portion of our experience is non-negotiable? PROBLEMS WITH PHENOMENALISM | 83\nA phenomenalist might try to answer this question by simply\ninsisting that there are laws that govern our experiences, and\nthese laws have some sort of greater authority or are somehow\nmore fixed and less changeable than the contingent truths we\nexperience. Perhaps the laws of nature are due to the program\nin the simulation or due to rules set down by God or a mad\nscientist. But if a phenomenalist insists on this, then they must\nappeal to facts that lie outside our experience: facts about the\nprogram, or God, or the mad scientist. There is nothing\ninternal to our experience to show that the laws of nature\nare more necessary than any other accidental generalization we\ncome across (like \u201call giraffes have long necks\u201d). This suggests\nthat one cannot be a \u201cpure\u201d phenomenalist and make sense of\nlaws of nature. They have to reach outside their experiences in\norder to explain something they have found to be true inside\ntheir experience.\nAlternatively, a phenomenalist might bravely deny that any\ngeneral truths are more necessary than others. They may insist\nthat \u201call giraffes have long necks\u201d is just as necessary, or just as\ncontingent, as \u201cfor every action there is an equal and opposite\nreaction.\u201d But the cost of making this denial is that it will ruin\nour efforts to explain natural phenomena. Normally, we try to\nexplain things in nature on the basis of a relatively small set of 84 | PROBLEMS WITH PHENOMENALISM\nfixed laws (like the laws discovered in physics and chemistry).\nDoing so, we think, gives us a deeper understanding of how\nnature works since it shows us why particular facts must\nhappen in the way they do. If we deny that there are any laws of\nnature and instead say there are just truths about how things\nhappen to be, it becomes ludicrously easy to explain anything.\nIf someone asks us why apples fall to the ground or why giraffes\nhave long necks or what makes gold more dense than copper,\nwe can simply declare, \u201cThat\u2019s how things are!\u201d and call it a\nday. It would not make sense to dig any deeper to try to find\nthe fixed features of nature that explain what we experience.\nSo, one problem with phenomenalism is that it is not clear\nhow it will allow us to distinguish contingent truths from\nnecessary truths. A second problem is that phenomenalism\nrequires us to believe in some strange things that exist in a\nmiddle place between objects and us, namely perceptions or\nexperiences. Other philosophers have called the perceptions\n\u201csense data.\u201d They are the things I have put inside clouds in the\ndiagrams. We have been presuming all along\u2014indeed, even the\nGDD itself makes this assumption\u2014that there is a difference\nbetween objects and our perceptions of objects, and that those\nperceptions could, in principle, exist without those objects\ncausing them. But is this a good assumption? How confident\nshould we be that sense data can exist on their own? PROBLEMS WITH PHENOMENALISM | 85\nOne must admit that sense data are weird things. There is no\nscientific evidence for their existence\u2014they do not show up in\nbrain scans, or under microscopes. But they are supposed to\nbe the most obvious things in the world that even an extreme\nskeptic cannot doubt. Do they vanish into nothingness when\nthey are not being experienced, and pop back into existence\nwhen we have experience? When I see a giraffe, then close my\neyes, and then look again, have I experienced two different\nsense data or have I experienced the same sense datum twice?\nHow can I be sure whether it is one or two sense data\u2014or three\nor more? If you stand where I stood and look at the same thing,\ndo you now enjoy the same sense datum I enjoyed a minute\nago? Or are the sense data two identical copies? There are not\ngood reasons for favoring one answer to these questions than\nany other. For being the most obvious things in the world,\nsense data are not very obvious after all!\nBut is there any way we can understand our experience\nwithout using sense data? Yes, there is. Suppose we do away\nwith sense data as intermediary objects existing between\nobjects and us. We say instead that we are experiencing the\nobjects directly. But of course your experience may not be\nexactly the same as my experience even though we are\nexperiencing the very same object. But this difference, we shall 86 | PROBLEMS WITH PHENOMENALISM\nsay, is not due to you having one sense datum and my having\nanother; it is instead due to you perceiving the object in one\nway and my perceiving the object in a different way. \u201cDifferent\nways of perceiving\u201d are not sense data; that is to say, there are\nnot different things standing between us and the objects we\nperceive. Rather, you and I are seeing the same thing, but in\ndifferent ways. It is a difference between adverbs rather than a\ndifference between nouns.\nThis might sound like we are merely playing with words, but\nin fact, this simple change in how we talk about our\nexperiences makes phenomenalism impossible. The whole idea\nof phenomenalism is that we can separate our perceptions\nfrom the objects alleged to cause those perceptions and make\ndo with just the perceptions themselves. But if there is no\nway to separate perceptions from those objects\u2014if perceptions\njust are those objects, perceived in a certain way or from a\nparticular point of view\u2014then the perceptions cannot be\nseparated from the objects, and phenomenalism does not even\nget off the ground. There is no gap between the observer and\nwhat is observed. PROBLEMS WITH PHENOMENALISM | 87\nThis way of understanding our perceptions avoids\npostulating sense data which (as we have seen) are weird things\nto postulate. It does postulate different ways of experiencing\nthings, but that is well understood. You see an object from\nsome position, under certain lighting conditions, while\nwearing sunglasses, and so on. This does not mean that the\nobject you are experiencing is different from the object anyone\nelse is experiencing; it means you are experiencing the same\nobject as other people are experiencing, but under different\nconditions. This means the objects really do exist after all.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Figure 4.4 \u00a9 Charlie Huenemann is licensed under a CC\nBY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license 12.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this chapter we have seen one way to respond to an extreme\nskeptic. That way is to deny that we need to have knowledge\nof objects outside our own experience and to insist that we\ncan make do with just the experiences themselves. The effort\nto base all our knowledge on actual experiences is known as\nphenomenalism, or empirical idealism. Many people do not\naccept phenomenalism, though their reasons for rejecting it are\nsometimes strange. But we have also seen that a phenomenalist\ndoes face two problems. One is the problem of distinguishing\nnecessary truths from contingent truths. It is not evident how\nexperiences alone can provide such a distinction. The other is\nthe problem of making sense of experiences, or sense data, as\nobjects. It is not obvious when two experiences should count\nas the same experience, or whether the same experience can\npop up at different times, and these are basic questions that\nshould be answerable about any object said to be real. 13.\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER\n1. Imagine two people arguing over whether Plato was\ntaller than Aristotle. They explore old texts, compare\nthem, and go round and round arguing about it. Now\nimagine two people arguing over whether Don Quixote\nwas taller than Hamlet. They explore old texts, compare\nthem, and go round and round arguing about it.\nSomeone might say that these two arguments are\ndifferent because there is a fact about whether Plato was\ntaller than Aristotle, but there is no such fact about\nHamlet and Don Quixote. What would a phenomenalist\nsay?\n2. Can two people experience the same hallucination? Is\nthere a difference between saying they experience the\nsame hallucination and saying they experience identical\nhallucinations? What about two people having the same\nidea or the same concept?\n3. Suppose some characters in a video game became 90 | QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER\nconscious and you can talk to them. Suppose further\nthat you explain to them the GDD, and they become\nskeptical of their knowledge of their world. You read this\nchapter to them\u2014or send them a copy of it\u2014and as a\nresult some of them become phenomenalists. Does this\nmake any sense? Can they become phenomenalists if the\nobjects they thought they were experiencing were only\nvirtual to begin with? 14.\nFURTHER READING\nBertrand Russell wrote an essay explaining exactly how\nphenomenalism works from a logical point of view in lecture\nthree of his book Our Knowledge of the External World\n(1915), which is available in several places on the internet\nincluding Wikisource. If that is not detailed enough for you,\nyou might turn to Ernst Mach\u2019s book, An Analysis of\nSensations (1897), or Rudolf Carnap\u2019s The Logical\nConstruction of the World (1928) or David Chalmers\u2019\nConstructing the World (2012).\nBut the most famous and readable phenomenalist of them all\nwas Bishop George Berkeley whose Treatise Concerning the\nPrinciples of Human Knowledge (1710) lays out a very clear\naccount of phenomenalism with powerful arguments for its\nappeal.\nLudwig Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical Investigations is a classic 92 | FURTHER READING\ntext ranging over many topics, but sections 398-411 throw\ndoubt upon the existence of sense data. It is a difficult text to\nwork through because you have to read it very carefully and\nslowly and think through each step, but it is a very rewarding\nexercise. PART V\n5. SECOND\nANSWER TO THE\nSKEPTIC  15.\nINTERNALISM AND\nEXTERNALISM\nAt this point, it is important to distinguish two different\ngeneral approaches to questions in epistemology: internalism\nand externalism. The difference is between figuring out\nknowledge \u201cfrom the inside\u201d (internalism) and figuring out\nknowledge \u201cfrom the outside\u201d (externalism). An internalist\napproach works with the resources each of us has as knowing\nbeings\u2014what we can sense, what we already believe, and what\nwe can reasonably conclude from those things. An externalist\napproach instead takes a broader view of knowing beings,\nconsidering not just what is \u201cinside\u201d them but also their\ncircumstances and their patterns of success in the past. It\nwould not be far off to say that internalism is epistemology\nfrom a first-person perspectivewhile externalism is epistemology\nfrom a third-person perspective. 96 | INTERNALISM AND EXTERNALISM\nAn analogy might be helpful. Suppose you are asked to rate\nthe performance of a certain plague doctor in 14th-century\nFlorence. You might first ask by what criteria you are supposed\nto rate this doctor. Should you rate the performance according\nto the set standards of 14th-century medicine? If so, then\nperhaps the doctor did a great job; he rubbed onions and dead\npigeons on the bodies of the plague victims and gave them\nvinegar to drink just as he was supposed to. This would be an\ninternalist rating, or a rating based on more local information.\nBut if you are supposed to rate the doctor according to today\u2019s\nmedical practices, you will have to conclude that his\nperformance was, well, not so great. This would be an\nexternalist rating since the standards come from factors far INTERNALISM AND EXTERNALISM | 97\nbeyond the plague doctor\u2019s own beliefs and experiences. There\nis something valuable to be learned from each approach,\nthough they are very different from one another and call upon\ndifferent sets of facts.\nSo how does this analogy apply to epistemology? In this way.\nSometimes we may find it important to understand the\nindividual\u2019s local information: their own experience, reason,\nand beliefs and the processes by which they come to know\nwhat they think they know (internalism). Other times we may\nwant to know, in fact, whether those processes really do deliver\nknowledge according to what the rest of us on the outside think\nwe know (externalism). We might examine the individual\u2019s\nmethods for forming beliefs in relation to what we know about\ntheir situation and what we know about the reliability of those\nmethods.\nMany philosophers have insisted that internalism best captures\nthe meaning of \u201cknowledge,\u201d and others have insisted that\nexternalism best captures the meaning of \u201cknowledge.\u201d But I\nsee no reason to make any such insistence any more than I\nsee any need to insist that one way of evaluating 14th-century\nFlorentine plague doctors is better than the other. Each way\ngets something right depending on what we are interested in. 98 | INTERNALISM AND EXTERNALISM\nOver the last couple of chapters we have seen how difficult it\nis to offer good internalist answers to the skeptic. What this\nmeans is that it is hard for us to find within ourselves reasons\nor experiences that show that what the skeptic says is false.\nPhenomenalism is one route a person could take, trying to\nbase all of their beliefs on sense data. Or they could follow\nDescartes\u2019s route and establish God\u2019s existence and God\u2019s good\nnature so that they can trust whatever seems to them clearly\nand distinctly to be true. These answers, as we have seen, only\ngo so far in answering the skeptic.\nBut what about an externalist answer to the skeptic? Here\nthere is much greater promise as an externalist can call upon\na broader circumstance that reaches beyond our own\nexperiences as individuals. Most significantly, an externalist can\ndraw upon the circumstance that, as a matter of fact, we are\nusually not being radically deceived. To see how this works,\nsuppose you are sitting in the library wondering if you are in\na GDD scenario. An externalist comes along and asks what\nyou are doing. You answer that you are undergoing a skeptical\ncrisis, and the externalist says, \u201cNope, clearly you are not in a\nGDD situation. For you are in the library, sitting in a chair.\nIf that is what it seems to you that you are doing, then you\nare right, my friend, for you really are doing it. Your beliefs INTERNALISM AND EXTERNALISM | 99\nare true, and your senses are reliable, so you have knowledge,\nand the GDD is refuted.\u201d We can then imagine the externalist\nsauntering away, whistling a jolly tune.\nNow it might seem to you that the externalist is missing the\npoint. What you want to know is whether you really are sitting\nin a chair in the library. But the externalist will say that, yes,\nreally, you are; it is a fact. \u201cBut how do you know?\u201d you ask.\nThe dialogue continues as follows:\nExternalist: I know this because my eyes are\nworking well (I visited the optometrist just\nyesterday), and I know what chairs and libraries\nare (I just watched a stimulating educational\nvideo on the topic), and I see you sitting here in a\nchair in the library.\nYou: Well, you think you do! How do you know\nyou\u2019re not being deceived by an evil demon or a\nmad scientist?\nExternalist: What an odd question! Do you see\nme standing here talking to you?\nYou: Yes, I think I do. 100 | INTERNALISM AND EXTERNALISM\nExternalist: Do you see any demons fluttering\nabout or wires coming out of my head or mad\nscientists around me?\nYou: No.\nExternalist: Do we have good evidence for\nthinking people are routinely deceived by\ndemons or mad scientists? Is this something you\nsee reported by credible media agencies?\nYou: No.\nExternalist: Do you regard it as a sound\nepistemic practice to go around believing in stuff\nthat you do not experience and is not reported to\nyou by any credible source?\nYou: No.\nExternalist: Then why on earth are you\ndoubting whether we are here having this\nconversation?\nIn this riveting dialogue, the externalist is changing frameworks\non you. Your doubt about being in the GDD scenario was\narising from an internalist perspective, and the answer being\noffered by the externalist is coming (rather predictably) from INTERNALISM AND EXTERNALISM | 101\nan externalist perspective. From that perspective, the GDD\nseems sort of silly.\nMaybe you are still not convinced? Well, the aim of this\nchapter is to show the merits of externalist approaches in\nepistemology.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Figure 5.1 \u00a9 Cuddly Beast is licensed under a CC BY-\nNC (Attribution NonCommercial) license 16.\nG. E. MOORE'S HANDS\nThe British philosopher G. E. Moore (1873-1958) famously\noffered an externalist reply to radical skepticism. Recall that\nradical skeptics are not sure of the existence of any material\nobjects, not even the existence of their own hands since they\nmight merely be having the experience of having hands while,\nin reality, not having any hands. To refute such radical skeptics,\nMoore would sometimes dramatically hold up one hand and\nassert, \u201cHere is one hand.\u201d Then he would raise his other hand\nand say, \u201cHere is another.\u201d He would conclude from this vivid\ndemonstration that there are at least two material objects\nexisting in the so-called external world. And from this\nconclusion, he drew a further conclusion: that the external\nworld exists.\nNow it is very tempting to make fun of Moore in providing\nsuch a simple argument. But he was a fiercely intelligent\nperson, and he knew exactly what he was doing. What he was\ndoing was calling to everyone\u2019s attention that the starting place\nof the skeptic\u2014that I know my experience but not what lies G. E. MOORE'S HANDS | 103\nbeyond it\u2014is not in fact more obvious than the starting place\nof the non-skeptic\u2014that, in fact, we typically do know that we\nhave hands (as well as many other things). In some cases, we\nmay not know that we have hands. If we have been in a terrible\naccident, for example, and the ends of our arms are wrapped in\nthick wads of bandages, then we may not be sure that we still\nhave hands. But ordinarily we are quite confident that we have\nhands, and the burden is on the skeptic to offer some positive\nreason for thinking we are mistaken about this. If we are sure\nwe have hands, then the proof of the existence of the external\nworld is relatively straightforward: \u201cHere is one hand \u2026 and\nhere is another.\u201d\nAn externalist, following Moore\u2019s line of thought, might well\nargue that the GDD is an abuse of language and the meanings\nof words (this particular line of thought is associated with\nLudwig Wittgenstein). For consider, how do we learn how\nto use words like \u201cknow\u201d and \u201cillusion\u201d and \u201cdeceive\u201d and\n\u201cdoubt\u201d? We learn them in very ordinary situations, in\nclassrooms and at home and in theaters and on the street. We\nlearn, for example, that stage magicians deceive us with hidden\npockets and trap doors and sleight of hand. We learn about\nmirages and optical illusions. We learn about liars and cover-\nups and conspiracies. In these ordinary situations, there aren\u2019t\nany deep puzzles about what we know or what it means to be\ndeceived. And we learn when it is appropriate to doubt or how 104 | G. E. MOORE'S HANDS\nsevere our doubt should be in particular real circumstances. It\nis not easy\u2014it requires a lot of thought and experiment and so\non\u2014but the challenges we face are familiar and common.\nThen we walk into a philosophy class, and we are asked to\napply the concepts that we learned in ordinary circumstances\nto circumstances that are unlike anything we have seen before:\ndeceiving gods and demons and mad scientists who exert\nmalicious control over everything we experience. But our\nordinary concepts are not meant to hold up in such\nextraordinary circumstances! It is a bit like learning that all\nnumbers greater than zero are either even or odd, and then\nbeing asked whether infinity is even or odd. It is not just a\nhard question, it is an impossible one. To this extent, the skeptic\nraising the GDD scenario is pushing our concepts well past\ntheir breaking points. By changing frameworks, the externalist\nis trying to pull us back into the circumstances where those\nconcepts are meant to apply. 17.\nEPISTEMOLOGY\nNATURALIZED\nThe American philosopher W. V. Quine (1908-2000) offered\nan externalist epistemology in which our understanding of\nknowledge is based on a scientific understanding of our\nsituation. Through science we are learning more and more\nabout the natural world, about human psychology, and about\nthe ways in which humans form beliefs about the world. Our\nscientific knowledge is not absolutely certain, of course\u2014it\nmay be that next week we learn that our current scientific\ntheories are wrong in many fundamental ways. But\ncontemporary science does represent the best we have been able\nto do so far (or let us assume this is so; more discussion of this\nwill come in the next chapter). Is it not natural to use what\nwe have learned about human psychology and the world in\norder to understand what it takes for human beings to know\nsomething?\nThis is what it means to naturalize epistemology: it is to see 106 | EPISTEMOLOGY NATURALIZED\nepistemology as continuous with our science of the natural\nworld, including the humans in it. When we ask, \u201cHow do we\nknow that we have hands?\u201d we should not seek some ground-\nshaking answer that will cause skeptics to run for cover. We\nshould take the question seriously in the way that a scientist\nwould. How do we know that we have hands? Well, our nerves\nare sending signals to our brains that indicate to us what our\nhands are doing and where they are, light waves are bouncing\noff our hands and entering our eyes, and signals are sent from\nour eyes to our brains where they are processed in such a way\nas to give us the belief that we have hands. Normally, our\nnerve signals are extremely reliable when it comes to telling\nus such things. If we doubt this, we could run an experiment\nwith many people, some with hands and some without, and\ndetermine just how reliable our nerve-signal-processing\nfunctions are. In the end, we will find that it is virtually certain\nthat those of us who think we have hands do in fact have\nhands.\nObjection: This so-called justification of our\nknowledge is circular. (Calling it \u201ccircular\u201d is to say that\nit assumes what it is supposed to prove.) After all, if I\nam really doubting whether I have hands, then I am also\ndoubting whether there are other people, and whether\nthere is any scientific knowledge, and whether careful\nso-called scientific experiments really show anything\nabout reality. But the externalist is supposing that we EPISTEMOLOGY NATURALIZED | 107\ndo have all of this scientific knowledge and then uses\nthat knowledge in order to justify that parts of that\nbig system of knowledge\u2014specifically, the parts that\ndescribe our nerve signals and brain functions\u2014are\ntrustworthy. The externalist is assuming our knowledge\nof the external world in order to justify the claim that\nwe do have knowledge of the external world. How\nconvincing is that supposed to be?\nQuine responded to this objection of circularity. His\nresponse was that the objection arises from a mistaken view\nabout how knowledge works. The objection supposes that\nthere should be some basic and fundamental things about\nwhich we could not possibly be wrong\u2014perhaps the cogito or\nthe basic experiences that the phenomenalist appeals to\u2014and\nthat knowledge, in order to be knowledge, needs to be based\nupon these basic and fundamental things. We might call this\nview foundationalism since the view is that all knowledge, in\norder to count as knowledge, must be founded upon basic and\nfundamental beliefs we cannot possibly be wrong about.\nQuine argued that this is a mistaken view of knowledge. He\nsuggested instead that our beliefs about ourselves and about\nthe world \u201chang together\u201d in a kind of web of belief. In a web, 108 | EPISTEMOLOGY NATURALIZED\nall of the strands and their connections rely on other strands\nand connections; the strength of the whole web is distributed\nacross all its parts. Similarly, in a web of belief, a belief is\nsupported by other beliefs which are supported by other\nbeliefs which are supported by other beliefs including,\nperhaps, the first belief we started with. Our beliefs are in this\nsense mutually supportive. This is what it means to say they\n\u201chang together.\u201d\nAccording to Quine, we should not expect all of our\nknowledge to depend upon a few beliefs that are absolutely\ncertain. Rather, we hope that our beliefs support one another\nin an overall coherent way. We still might regard some beliefs\nas very central to our web\u2014meaning that many other beliefs\ndepend on them, such as the belief that our senses are not\ndeceiving us. But even these beliefs might be called into\nquestion if our other beliefs demand it. Suppose, for example,\nthat we think we see a floating cat, and then our roommates EPISTEMOLOGY NATURALIZED | 109\nshow us a very clever projector they are using to make the\nimage of a floating cat. Now we have to decide whether to\nbelieve our roommates and their explanation or to believe our\nsenses that there really is a floating cat and our roommates are\nlying to us for whatever strange reason. Our other beliefs\u2014for\nexample, that our roommates geek out over technological\ntricks, and floating cats are not commonly found within\nanyone\u2019s experience, and holding my hand in front of the\nprojector lens makes the floating cat disappear\u2014eventually\npersuade us to give up on the floating cat and to believe that it\nwas only a projection. We can imagine different circumstances\nthat would persuade us not to believe our roommates.\nBut here is another worry we might consider. The person who\ndefends the web-of-belief view, or epistemological holism (as\nit is called), thinks that our beliefs all hang together in some\nmutually supportive structure. But might not two people each\nhave mutually supportive webs of belief that disagree\nfundamentally with one another? Suppose one person believes\nthat humans traveled to the Moon in 1969. A second person\nbelieves it was all a hoax. Each person has a mutually\nsupportive web of beliefs supporting their belief about\nhumans on the Moon: one person has all the beliefs we would\nexpect including beliefs about film footage and reports from\nnewspapers and NASA and so on, and the other person has\nbeliefs about government conspiracies and cover-up 110 | EPISTEMOLOGY NATURALIZED\noperations and movie sets made to look like the Moon and\nso on. We cannot fault either person with inconsistency. But\nclearly they cannot both have knowledge, can they? So what\nshould we say?\n(Can we say that they both have knowledge? So then, it is true\nfor one person that humans traveled to the Moon and true for\nthe other person that it was a hoax? Remember, we are not\nmerely saying that this is what each of them believe. We are\ntalking about knowledge. So we are saying that what is true\nmay vary from person to person and not just for subjective\nthings like favorite colors and banjo tunes, but for all sorts of\nthings, including moon landings, ocean levels, and the shape of\nMt. Fuji. Can we make sense of this? We will explore the idea\nfurther in the next chapter.)\nSupposing for now that \u201ctrue-for-you-but-false-for-me\u201d is not\nan option, what is the epistemological holist to say about the\nMoon landing case? Quine, and indeed any naturalized\nepistemologist, would insist that the person who believes in\nthe Moon landing is right, and the other person is wrong.\nWhy? Because, as a matter of fact, we did send humans to the\nMoon in 1969, and all of the reports from the news and NASA\nare quite accurate. Remember the virtue of externalism: we can EPISTEMOLOGY NATURALIZED | 111\nappeal to facts outside an individual\u2019s sets of beliefs. We know\nthe facts in this case, and we can trace how the person who\nbelieves in the Moon landing came to have their belief, and\nwe can connect that belief to the facts. We can also trace how\nthe conspiracy theorist came to have their belief and connect\nthat belief to facts about paranoia and spurious claims made by\nother paranoid people. Case closed.\nObjection: But wait! Who is to say that Quine\u2019s\noverall web of belief, which tells him that the Moon\nlanding person is right and the other person is wrong, is\nthe right web of belief to have?\nWell, Quine would say, we are the ones to say\u2014those of us\nwho share a naturalized worldview. Of course, we will all admit\nthat we might be wrong. But until some better web of beliefs\ncomes along, we will keep on with the one we have. If in raising\nyour objection you are expecting Quine to produce some fact\nas solid as iron that will favor one web of belief over another,\nthen you are still using the mistaken foundationalist view of\nknowledge. We are always in the middle of working out our\nbeliefs from our current web of beliefs, making adjustments\nwhere we need to, and trying to keep everything hanging\ntogether. There\u2019s nothing more a human can do so far as\nknowledge goes. And given what we have been able to work\nout so far, we can be pretty sure that humans landed on the 112 | EPISTEMOLOGY NATURALIZED\nMoon in 1969, and people claiming otherwise are simply\nwrong.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Figure 5.2 \u00a9 Charlie Huenemann is licensed under a CC\nBY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license 18.\nBACK TO BACON\nWe should recall Bacon\u2019s claim that \u201cKnowledge itself is\npower.\u201d In this chapter we have seen that a second way to\nanswer the skeptic is by changing our view of knowledge from\ninternalism to externalism and from foundationalism to\nepistemological holism. The result is that we should believe the\nworld pretty much is as we already think it is, and we should\nmake changes in our beliefs only when some tough evidence\ncomes along that forces us to make a change. But consider\nthe effect of such a view for society as a whole. On a great\nmany topics and questions, most people will end up with a\ndominant view of what is known. There will be some people\nin the margins who disagree with the dominant view, but those\nof us holding the dominant view will discount their beliefs as\neasily as we brushed aside the view of the conspiracy theorist\nat the end of the previous section. Externalist epistemological\nholism (such a name!) seems to give us license to reject the\nclaims to knowledge made by those in the margins. And this\nshould worry us. 114 | BACK TO BACON\nOf course, we might say that the same view also gives the\ngroups in the margins license to continue to maintain their\nwebs of belief in the same way that those who believe the\ndominant view are maintaining theirs (for ease of discussion in\nwhat follows, let\u2019s simply call these two groups \u201cthe Margins\u201d\nand \u201cthe Dominants\u201d). But of course there is a considerable\ndifference in power between the Margins and the Dominants.\nWho will decide what\u2019s taught in public schools? Whose\nknowledge will inform policy decisions? Who will get the jobs\nand grants for research and development? The Dominants, of\ncourse. Note also that externalist epistemological holism does\nnot offer any reason for thinking that the Dominant view is\nbetter justified or more thoroughly known or more true than\nthe Margin view. The only justification for the Dominants\noverruling the Margins is the fact that they have the power to\ndo so.\nBut let us not write off the Margins just yet. If the Margins are\nable to produce experiments or problems or questions that the\nDominants must deal with in some way, there is the possibility\nfor the Margins\u2019 view to prevail. One might think here of the\nway in which Copernican astronomy (sun-centered solar\nuniverse) eventually replaced Ptolemaic astronomy (earth-\ncentered universe). The history of this transition is long and\ncomplicated, but overall, when seen from high altitude, the\nMargin\u2019s view outperformed the Dominant view by criteria BACK TO BACON | 115\nthe Dominants themselves shared (such as the value of\naccurate astronomical predictions). Similarly, the Darwinians\novercame Aristotelian view in biology, and the Einsteinians\novercame the Newtonians in physics.\nAnd with these examples coming up, it is time to turn to\nscience. 19.\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER\n1.

As it has been written, \u201cOur other beliefs \u2026 eventually\npersuade us to give up on the floating cat and to believe that it\nwas only a projection.

PART VI\n6. SCIENTIFIC\nKNOWLEDGE\nScientific knowledge is a great human achievement. Because\nof this knowledge, we can successfully navigate around our\nworld and describe its size, shape, and mass. We know our\nworld is a planet orbiting a star. We can say how fast light\ntravels and how long it would take for light to travel to the\nnext nearest star, which we know is smaller than our sun but\ndenser. We know how to remove a heart that isn\u2019t working\nand replace it with one that is\u2014and possibly, with one we have\nmanufactured ourselves. We know how to replenish soil so that\nit continues to sustain crops, how to smash atoms together to\nre-create energy levels comparable to those at the beginning\nof the universe, and how to inoculate against smallpox. Of\ncourse, the list could go on and on.\nAnd on and on it should go lest we underestimate just how\nmuch we know. We know that osmium is the densest stable\nelement, that Triceratops lived about 68 million years ago, that\nthe eruption of Krakatoa ejected six cubic miles of rock into\nthe sky, and that the opossum is North America\u2019s only native 120 | 6. SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE\nmarsupial. We know human blood comes in various types,\nand we know what types of blood may be transferred from\nhuman to human without deleterious consequences. We know\nhow to turn lead into gold (yes, really, but it costs a lot), how\nto generate x-rays and block them, how to keep subatomic\nparticles in a superposition, and how to arrange them so as to\nperform calculations across several possible worlds at once.\nThat is a lot of knowledge. And in this chapter, when we turn\neventually to asking whether scientific \u201cknowledge\u201d is actually\nknowledge, we would do well to remember this astonishing list\nthat captures barely a sliver of all the knowledge we frequently\ntake for granted. Scientific knowledge merits special attention\nin epistemology because\u2014on first glance, at the very least\u2014it\nis the greatest tradition of knowledge-getting in all of human\nhistory. 21.\nLOGIC, MATH, AND\nSCIENCE\nWe should begin by situating scientific knowledge among\nother types of knowledge. As we have seen, some known\npropositions are contingent, meaning that they express facts\nthat easily could have been otherwise. As it happens, for\nexample, some lucky person in Canyon County won the Idaho\nPowerball jackpot in August 2017. That could have been\notherwise\u2014someone else could have won, or the prize might\nhave gone unclaimed for another month. It snowed last\nThursday (again), so weather patterns might have shifted\nslightly, bringing the snow sooner or later or not at all. Of\ncourse, for these events to have been otherwise, the particular\ncauses would have had to have been different, and for those\nparticular causes to have been different, their causes would have\nhad to have been different, and so on. But none of these\nchanges seem impossible. Each change is \u201cthinkable\u201d or\nimaginable on its own. 122 | LOGIC, MATH, AND SCIENCE\nOther known propositions are necessary, meaning that they\nreally could not be otherwise. So in geometry, for example,\na cube contained within a sphere has less volume than the\nsphere. It\u2019s hard to get around that fact\u2014there is no way it\ncould be otherwise, given the meanings of the terms we are\nusing. In these causes, it is not a matter of re-engineering causes\nto bring about different effects. The changes themselves are\nunthinkable or unimaginable.\n(Someone might wonder if this cube/sphere proposition\nmight be considered contingent since it is, after all, contingent\nthat the words \u201ccube\u201d and \u201csphere\u201d mean what they do in\nEnglish. Clearly, those words might have meant different\nthings. It is a good question. One reason philosophers like to\ntalk about propositions is that a proposition is supposed to be\nthe meaning of what is said in whatever language. So, yes, the\nsentence, \u201cThe cube is in the sphere\u201d might have meant many\ndifferent things or nothing at all; but the proposition that the\ncube is in the sphere means precisely one thing: the thing that is\nalso meant when we say, \u201cel cubo est\u00e1 en la esfera\u201d or \u201ca kocka\na g\u00f6mbben van\u201d or \u201ctha an ci\u00f9b anns an raon\u201d which all mean\n\u201cthe cube is in the sphere.\u201d)\nThe known propositions of logic and mathematics are LOGIC, MATH, AND SCIENCE | 123\nnecessary. How do we know they are necessary? Is it simply\na matter of what we can or cannot imagine? This is a very\ngood question. A first answer might be that we know these\npropositions are necessary because if we deny them, then we\ncan derive a contradiction from them. So, for example, five plus\nthree equals eight is a true and necessary proposition. If we try\nto deny it, we end up in the following sort of trouble:\n5 + 3 \u2260 8 (suppose)\n(xxxxx) + (xxx) \u2260 (xxxxxxxx) (by definitions of\n\u201c5\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, and \u201c8\u201d)\n(xxxxxxxx) \u2260 (xxxxxxxx) (by definition of\n\u201c+\u201d)\n8 \u2260 8 (by definition\nof \u201c8\u201d)\nABSURD! (by definition\nof \u201c\u2260\u201d)\nSo we might say that necessary propositions are those whose\ndenials entail contradictions or results that are false in virtue\nof the meanings of the terms. Perhaps this is a good enough\nanswer. But some philosophers\u2014notably W. V. Quine whom\nwe encountered in the last chapter\u2014have wondered whether\n\u201cmeanings of terms\u201d are fixed in such precise ways as to allow\nfor a clear distinction between necessary and contingent\ntruths. Don\u2019t we learn the meanings of terms in rather\ninformal circumstances, which allow for quite a lot of slippage 124 | LOGIC, MATH, AND SCIENCE\nand unclarity and vagueness? So, for example, what about the\nclaim that Catholic priests are male? Is that true in virtue of\nthe meanings of the terms, or is it a contingent truth based\non decisions made by a particular tradition? Is it obviously\n\u201cmore necessarily\u201d true than the claim that some dogs have\ntails? We might wonder whether there really are hard-edged\n\u201cmeanings\u201d of terms that allow us to definitively determine\nwhether a given claim is necessarily true or contingently true.\nThis objection is generally known as \u201cQuine\u2019s criticism of the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction\u201d and it is an interesting and\nimportant discussion to study, but it is a bit beyond our reach\nin this introduction.\nSo, having mentioned that objection, I will now set it aside,\nand continue as if we have some good way of distinguishing\nnecessary truths from contingent truths. Logical truths (such\nas \u201cP \u21d4 P\u201d or \u201cif P \u21d2 Q and Q \u21d2 R, then P \u21d2 R\u201d or \u201cif\nP v Q and ~Q, then P\u201d) and mathematical truths (including\nall those in arithmetic, geometry, algebra, calculus, etc.) are\nnecessary truths. We know they are necessary truths because if\nwe try to deny them, we will find that we can derive claims\nthat are false in virtue of the meanings of the terms. Other\nparticular facts about the world such as what happened here or\nthere, how long some particular rhino\u2019s horn is, or who stole\nthe cookies from the cookie jar, and so on, are contingent. We\nknow they are contingent because if we deny them, we will find LOGIC, MATH, AND SCIENCE | 125\nthat we can derive claims that, in fact, are false but not false\nin virtue of the meanings of the terms. Denying that Slim Jim\nwon the Idaho lottery, for instance, might make it harder for us\nto explain how he was able to afford a shiny new Cadillac, but\nit will not lead us to derive claims that are false by virtue of the\nmeanings of \u201cCadillac,\u201d \u201clottery,\u201d or \u201cIdaho.\u201d\nNow what about known propositions of science? In\nparticular, what about the known propositions we identify\nas laws of nature? These known propositions seem to be\nsomewhere between necessary and contingent. We can deny\nthem without running into contradictions about meanings\nof terms. So, for example, suppose it is a law of nature that\nforce equals mass times acceleration. Indeed, this was once\nthought to be a law of nature known as \u201cNewton\u2019s second\nlaw of motion.\u201d It was thought to be a rock-solid truth, one\nperhaps that could not be otherwise. But since then, we have\nlearned that this law not only could be otherwise, but it actually\nis otherwise since, to update it to Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity,\nwe need to complicate the equation a bit (i.e., taking into\naccount how fast the observer is moving relative to the speed\nof light). Einstein made this advance upon Newton without\nrunning contrary to any of the meanings of the terms involved:\n\u201cmass\u201d still meant \u201cmass,\u201d but the relation to force and\nacceleration turned out to be a little different. So it is evidently\npossible to deny Newton\u2019s second law of motion without 126 | LOGIC, MATH, AND SCIENCE\nentailing a contradiction. Moreover, it is possible to deny\nEinstein\u2019s laws without entailing a contradiction. And, indeed,\nany of the known laws of nature can be denied without\nentailing a contradiction.\nDoes that make the laws of nature contingent? It does if we\nhold fast to the claim that contingent propositions are the ones\nthat can be denied without entailing any contradiction. But at\nthe same time, there is something about laws of nature that\nmake them seem similar to necessary truths. Laws of nature\nare more fundamental\u2014\u201ccloser to the core of reality,\u201d so to\nspeak\u2014than contingent facts about particular things. When\nscientists discover basic laws of nature, they are getting at deep\ntruths about reality, truths that could be different only if\nreality itself were different in some fundamental way. This\ndepth of the truth of laws of nature makes them seem similar\nto truths in logic or mathematics, which also could be different\nonly if reality itself were different in some really fundamental\nway.\nPerhaps an example will make this idea clearer. Suppose we\ninflate a balloon until it bursts. We can imagine all sorts of\nways to vary this exciting experiment: we could use thicker\nor thinner balloons, we could use different sorts of gases, we LOGIC, MATH, AND SCIENCE | 127\ncould inflate the balloon more or less quickly, we could do it on\nmountaintops or down in the valley, during the day or night,\nand so on. These are changes we can easily make. But suppose\nthat instead of making any of these easy changes, we want to\nkeep everything exactly the same but delay the bursting for an\nextra minute. That is to say, we want to use the same sort of\nballoon, the same gas, the same outside pressure, the same rate\nof inflation but just delay the bursting by a minute. To do this,\nwe will have to change some natural fact that has to do with\nthe strength of the balloon material. We will have to change a\ndeep fact about the nature of the world and, specifically, about\nhow much that sort of material can stretch before ripping.\nThat\u2019s really hard to do. In fact, for creatures like us, it is\nimpossible, for humans cannot alter the laws of nature that\ngovern the limits of materials.\nOf course, in words, or conceptually, we can deny whatever law\nof nature that is involved in this experiment, and our denial\nwill not entail any contradiction. But we cannot deny or\nchange the law in fact. We cannot really make it false. There is\na sort of necessity to the law of nature that simply is not found\nin the other particular circumstances, all of which we are able\nto change by using different balloon materials, a different gas,\ndifferent altitudes, and so on. 128 | LOGIC, MATH, AND SCIENCE\nSo the denial of a law of nature is impossible, but for some\nreason other than that the denial of the law entails a\ncontradiction. It would be interesting to continue to pursue\nthis line of thought, but once again, this is a topic that takes\nus quickly into matters beyond the scope of this introduction.\nFor our purposes, we might simply recognize three types of\nnecessity: logical necessity, mathematical necessity, and natural\nnecessity which is the sort of necessity pertaining to scientific\nlaws of nature. The differences among these kinds of necessity\nare philosophically interesting, but we won\u2019t pursue the topic\nhere. 22.\nHOW DO WE KNOW\nTHE LAWS OF NATURE\nARE TRUE?\nThis question might be asked in two tones of voice: \u201chow do\nwe know?\u201d in the sense that maybe we don\u2019t, and \u201chow do\nwe know?\u201d in the sense of really, how do we manage to know\nthat they are true? Let\u2019s take that second sense first. What sorts\nof observations and reasoning gives us reason for thinking a\nsupposed law of nature is actually true?\nWe should begin by noting that laws of nature are general\nstatements about regularities that objects and their features\nmust obey. Force is always required to cause a mass to change\nvelocity. Pressure is always directly proportional to\ntemperature and inversely proportional to volume. Overall\nentropy never decreases in an isolated system. Laws of nature\nare lawlike in the generalities they describe and in their force.\nThey do not invoke specific particular objects, like the phone\nin your pocket or the top of Mt. Fuji or Larry from down the 130 | HOW DO WE KNOW THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE TRUE?\nhall. Laws of nature state general truths which may apply to all\nrelevant particulars but never focus on any specific particulars.\nBut, of course, all we ever see are specific particulars. And,\nas noticed back in our discussion of phenomenalism, we see\nthat events happen, but we never see the necessity in their\nhappening. So how do we arrive at knowledge of laws of\nnature?\nOne might begin by thinking that we arrive at knowledge of\nlaws of nature by observing a phenomenon repeatedly and\nseeing what regularities hold. So, for example, a line of frogs\ncomes our way, and the first one hops, and the second one\nhops, and the third one hops, and so on, and eventually we\nbegin to think that maybe \u201call frogs hop\u201d is true. That is a\ngeneral statement, and it seems to be based on observing a\nstring of particulars.\nBut there is a logical problem. It simply does not follow from\nthe claim that one frog hops and a second frog hops and a\nthird one hops that all frogs hop. Moreover, the observation\nthat all the frogs observed so far hop does not demonstrate any\nnecessity in their hopping. Consider for contrast the situation HOW DO WE KNOW THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE TRUE? | 131\nin which an old man in front of you in line at a convenience\nstore pulls one penny out of his pocket and then pulls another\none out of his pocket and then a third one\u2026 As frustrating as\nthe experience may be for you, you should not conclude from\nit that all coins in the pockets of old men in convenience stores\nmust be pennies. Your tedious experience does not allow you\nto boast that you have discovered a new law of nature.\nOf course, doing real science is harder than just watching frogs\nhop or old men count out change. Scientists observe carefully,\nemploy control groups, and run tests to find accidental\ncorrelations. But even so the logical fact remains that no\nnumber of particular observations show the truth of a general\nand necessary claim. Put another way, a general truth, like a law\nof nature, is always underdetermined by its evidence. This,\nby the way, is known as the problem of induction, and it was\nmade famous (or infamous) by David Hume (1711-1776). To\nmake the point in another way, suppose we make five careful\nobservations. Which of the dotted lines most accurately\nportrays the law of nature we have discovered? 132 | HOW DO WE KNOW THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE TRUE?\nThey both do; each one models our data. The problem\nthough is that there just isn\u2019t enough data to tell us what to\ndo with the spaces in-between the data points. This is what is\nmeant by \u201cunder-determination.\u201d The two different ways of\nconstruing what is going on make different predictions about\nwhat patterns we will find as we make further observations.\nFurther observations may help us to rule out some\npossibilities. But no matter how many further observations we\nmake, we will always have many different ways of connecting\nthe dots.\nSo we do not easily \u201cread off\u201d general statements from the data.\nWhat do we do? At this point it would be sensible to admit\nthat our observations of particulars do not demonstrate what\nthe laws of nature are. Instead, perhaps they only give us some HOW DO WE KNOW THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE TRUE? | 133\nidea of what sorts of correlations there might be in the world,\nand based upon this idea we frame a hypothesis about what the\nlaws of nature are. The hypothesis, we will admit, may be true\nor false, but it is a good guess based on what we have seen so\nfar.\nThis suggestion obviously brings us to the famed scientific\nmethod. The method, in short summary, is this. Begin with\nsome observations; frame a hypothesis; generate a prediction\nfrom the hypothesis; devise a test to determine if your\nprediction is accurate; if it is \u2013 well done, keep testing; if it isn\u2019t\n\u2013 then start over. We need not go into further detail for our\npurposes, and the method is probably already familiar to most\nreaders.\nNote, however, that the scientific method does not deliver\ncertain knowledge of the laws of nature. Each known law of\nnature is a hypothesis that has not yet been decisively refuted\nby experiments. That is the most that can be said of the\nhypothesis, and it is clearly not the same as saying that some\nlaw of nature is known with certainty. But perhaps that is okay.\nAs we have seen, knowledge need not be certain in order to\ncount as knowledge; it need only be a justified, true belief (recall\nJTB) whose truth helps to explain why it is believed (JTB+). 134 | HOW DO WE KNOW THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE TRUE?\nSo long as we are justified in our belief of the scientific claim\nthat has been made (which we have not yet discussed), then it\nwill turn out that we know the claim \u2013 just so long as it does\nturn out to be true, and the JTB+ conditions have been met.\nThis gives us occasion to reflect on the sentence \u201cIt\u2019s only a\ntheory.\u201d Many times people use this phrase to remind us that\nthe theory of evolution, for instance, is only a theory. It is\nimplied that when something is only a theory, it is not known\nwith certainty, or perhaps not even known very well at all. But\nonce we recognize that very little of our knowledge of nature is\nknown with certainty, we should reject the implication behind\nsaying \u201cIt\u2019s only a theory.\u201d If \u201ctheory\u201d just means not known\nwith certainty, then basically all of the knowledge of nature we\nuse to build bridges, cure diseases, manufacture cell phones,\nand boil water is only a theory. And in fact, this is not a good\nway to understand the term \u201ctheory\u201d anyway. A common\ndefinition of the term is that a theory is \u201ca supposition or\na system of ideas intended to explain something, especially a\nsystem based on general principles independent of the thing\nto be explained.\u201d Note that nothing is said about certainty.\nA theory is an explanation-provider; whether any particular\ntheory is plausible or not, or very likely true or not, or even\ncertain or not, is a completely separate matter. HOW DO WE KNOW THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE TRUE? | 135\nThis admission, that we can never know with complete\ncertainty whether our claims about the natural world are true,\nis called fallibilism. Our knowledge is fallible, which means it\nmight turn out not to be knowledge at all. It is a good guess we\nare working with until we have evidence that it is false.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Figure 6.1 \u00a9 Charlie Huenemann is licensed under a CC\nBY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license 23.\nBUT HOW DO WE\nKNOW THE LAWS OF\nNATURE ARE TRUE?\nNow we can turn to the other tone of voice in which the\nquestion can be asked. This other way of asking the question\nasks whether our alleged knowledge of the laws of nature really\nshould count as knowledge. Does science count as genuine\nknowledge?\nAs we have seen, if alleged knowledge should count as genuine\nknowledge only when we have the sort of absolute certainty\nthat would shock a skeptic into amazed silence, then we do not\nhave genuine scientific knowledge. But in that case, we have\nhardly any genuine knowledge whatsoever, and we have seen\nwhere that leaves us. So suppose we lower our standards a bit\nso as to allow many of the items we typically regard ourselves to\ngenuinely know: that we have hands, that our senses typically\ndo not deceive us, that regular and constant patterns in our\nexperience (like apples falling and clothes drying and water BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE TRUE? | 137\nfreezing) will continue to hold in the future, that other people\nexist, and so on. Suppose, in short, we adopt a more ordinary\nattitude toward our experience. Given our ordinary attitude\ntoward our experience, the one we have when an extreme\nskeptic is not pestering us, do we have good reason for\ncounting our alleged scientific knowledge as genuine\nknowledge?\nIt might seem that the answer is obviously yes. After all, every\nscientific claim is accompanied by a list of observations and\nexperiments that (in principle) anyone can access or perform.\nThese observations and experiments belong in the sphere of\nour ordinary knowledge of the world. The scientific claims or\ntheories are based upon those observations and experiments\nthrough the general method outlined in accounts of \u201cthe\nscientific method.\u201d This makes scientific knowledge\ncontinuous with our ordinary knowledge of the world and just\nas genuinely known. The idea here is that we can take any\nreasonable person who trusts their experience and show them\nstep-by-step how we have reached the scientific conclusions\nwe have reached and why these conclusions are reasonable to\nbelieve even if, as we admit, there is always the possibility that\nwe might be wrong about some or all of it. 138 | BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE TRUE?\nBut here is a line of objection that might be presented. The\ncentral idea is one articulated by Thomas S. Kuhn\n(1922-1996), though it should be pointed out that Kuhn\nhimself never used this idea to criticize scientific knowledge.\nStill, others influenced by Kuhn have used the idea to this\nend. The idea is this: scientists are always coming up with the\nbest theories they can given the ideas they have, the evidence\nat the time, and what they are interested in. When scientists\ncome up with these theories, they are creating a paradigm or\na worldview that basically says \u201chere are the problems we are\ninterested in, and here are the methods we should use to solve\nthem.\u201d Then teams of scientists normally get to work trying\nto solve the problems they are interested in. We can call this\nperiod of normal scientific activity normal science.\nEvery so often some scientist develops a new paradigm or\nworldview that is radically different from the one being\nemployed in normal science. The paradigm presents a wholly\ndifferent view of the world, a different set of problems to solve\nand a different set of methods to use in solving them.\nSometimes these new paradigms just fail\u2014no one else gets\ninterested in them, they don\u2019t work very well, and they sputter\nand die. But sometimes younger scientists get very excited by\nthe new paradigm. They regard it as an exciting and useful\nnew development, and they begin to use it and promote it to\nothers. Over time the new paradigm may take the place of the BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE TRUE? | 139\nold paradigm, and that is when a paradigm shift or a scientific\nrevolution occurs.\nWhat causes a paradigm shift to occur? What explains the\nsuccess of a new paradigm? For a long time historians of\nscience believed that a new paradigm is successful when it\nallows for better predictions or better methods of solving\nproblems. But Kuhn\u2019s work in the history of science showed\nthat this is not so, or at least, not always so. Remember, the\nnew paradigm is radically different from the old paradigm.\nThis means that the standards of what counts as \u201cbetter\npredictions\u201d or \u201cbetter methods\u201d also changes. There is no\ncommon standard of measure between an old paradigm and\na new paradigm. For this reason, Kuhn called paradigms\nincommensurable: there is no meaningful way to compare one\nto the other.\nSo a paradigm shift does not happen because the new\nparadigm is clearly better than the old one. Rather, Kuhn\nargued, a paradigm shift happens because purely human and\nhistorical conditions give the new paradigm an advantage over\nthe old one. In the simplest possible case, the old guys\ndefending the old paradigm eventually die, and the younger\nguys with the new paradigm get their jobs causing the 140 | BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE TRUE?\nparadigm shift to occur. In more realistic and complicated\ncases, there are political and economic and ideological\npressures that all come into play and end up favoring the new\nparadigm over the old one. But these pressures do not\nguarantee that a new paradigm will be \u201cbetter\u201d in terms of\nbeing better knowledge of the world.\nThe end result of this\u2014though again, not one that Kuhn\nhimself embraced but one embraced by scholars influenced\nby him\u2014is that scientific progress is an illusion. There are\nchanges in scientific theories, of course, but the changes are\nnot brought on by objective measurements and experiments.\nThey are brought on by social pressures. Science, then, is sort\nof like fashion or the evolution of styles in art. Attitudes and\nstyles change, and people with the new styles and attitudes\nview them as improvements, but really the change does not\nindicate that the new attitudes and styles are closer to the truth.\nObjection: This could not possibly be true. After\nall, do we not have better medicine, better technology,\nand more thorough explanations of nature than any\nprevious generation? Read again the first two\nparagraphs of this essay!\nBut here is a reply: perhaps the advances in medicine and BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE TRUE? | 141\ntechnology would have happened anyway under the terms of\nthe old paradigms, and the new paradigms really had nothing\nto do with those advances. And so far as \u201cmore thorough\nexplanations\u201d go, that judgment is being made from the\nperspective of the new paradigm. The judgment is biased\ntoward the new view. The old paradigms also had very\nthorough explanations, though, of course, using different\nterms and ideas. What reason do we really have for believing\nour paradigm is better than theirs?\nThis last question should be taken seriously, and not just\nrhetorically. Are our modern scientific theories better than\nprevious scientific theories? Could previous theories, in\nprinciple, make sense of the technological advances that have\naccompanied modern theories? Rather than simply\nconcluding \u201cwell who knows? Maybe!\u201d from the comfort of\nour armchairs, we might actually try to determine whether, for\nexample, Aristotelian science could allow us to make sense of\ngene therapy. What new advances would have to be made by\nsucceeding generations of Aristotelian scientists? What further\nelaborations would have to be made to their theories? In the\nend, would the revised Aristotelian theories be fundamentally\ndifferent from our modern theories? Or would they just be\nthe same idea in different words? Can someone come up with\ndistinct neo-Aristotelian alternatives to the many ways we\nunderstand the natural world around us without simply 142 | BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE TRUE?\nrepackaging what we think is true in Aristotelian-sounding\nlanguage?\nTo date no one has really taken up this challenge in a thorough-\ngoing way. Of course, we can never know what twists and\nturns alternative histories might have made, and there is always\nthe possibility that inventive Aristotelians could have kept\ntheir tradition going and perhaps could have led to even more\nimpressive technological achievements. But one might well ask\nwhat evidence we have for believing this possibility is real and\nwhether it is stronger than the evidence we have for believing\ncontemporary scientific knowledge to be genuine. It is not\nenough merely to claim that a rival paradigm might have\nenjoyed equal success in controlling and predicting the natural\nworld; one must show that it is true. Until that challenge has\nbeen met, we do not have good reason to think that the old\nparadigms are \u201cjust as true\u201d as the newer ones. 24.\nSOCIAL CONDITIONS OF\nSCIENTIFIC\nKNOWLEDGE\nBut even if the more dramatic claim that there has been no\nscientific progress does not seem compelling, there is a valuable\nlesson to be drawn from Kuhn\u2019s historical argument. The\nvaluable lesson is that science does not develop in a vacuum.\nScientists are human beings, and scientific institutions have\nconnections to funding agencies, economics, politics, and\nculture at large. At any given time, multiple pressures are\naffecting how science develops. Some of them are \u201cproper,\u201d\nhaving only to do with evidence, observation, experiment, and\ntheoretical integrity. Some of them have less to do with a\nconcern for scientific truth and more to do with the human\nambitions and prejudices of the scientists or their bosses.\nAn example is the 50-year struggle to recognize the toxicity\nof lead in gasoline. Lead was introduced into gasoline in the\n1920s to stop engines from making knocking noises. It was 144 | SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE\nalready well known that lead was harmful to living organisms\nand made people behave erratically, but the scientists employed\nby fuel companies insisted that the levels of lead in gasoline\nwere safe for human beings. They were not, and the evidence\nwas manifestly clear that the levels of lead were unsafe.\nCommittees were formed and studies were performed, but the\nresults of the studies for several decades was that lead should\ncontinue to be put into gasoline and further research should be\ndone. In the 1970s, lead was eventually banned by the newly-\nformed Environmental Protection Agency. By that time, the\naverage level of lead in people\u2019s bodies in the US was well\nbeyond safe levels, children were underperforming in schools,\nand crime rates were rising as a direct result of lead poisoning.\nA similar story can be told of the ways in which scientific\nstudies commissioned by oil companies skewed the data to\nsuppress information about global warming for decades.\nIn such cases claims to scientific knowledge have been shaped\nfar more by economic considerations than by a proper concern\nfor genuine knowledge. Of course, it is also true that we\neventually learned of the effects of leaded gasoline and the\neffects of carbon emissions on our atmosphere precisely\nthrough scientific inquiry once it was freed from the\ndistortions of economics and politics. So the cases of science\nbeing distorted by social conditions are not enough to discredit\nscience as a whole. But they are enough to cause us to examine SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE | 145\nclaims to scientific knowledge with some awareness of their\nsocial contexts.\nAnd, of course, this point does not apply only to scientists but\nto all of us. Social conditions shape human knowledge. We will\nturn to this topic in the next chapter. 25.\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER\n1. Someone might try to solve the problem of induction in\nthe following way: \u201cOver time, we have found that\ninferring a generalization from a number of particular\nobservations has worked, so we should be able to trust\ndoing the same thing now and in the future.\u201d Why\ndoesn\u2019t this solve the problem of induction?\n2. I often hear people claim that science can never know\n\u201ccapital-T Truth.\u201d What on earth does this mean, and\nwhy would someone think it is true (or \u201cTrue\u201d)?\n3. \u201cWe have excellent historical evidence for believing that\nthe claims of science are not based on objective evidence,\nbut are instead just based on the prejudices of the time\nand place from which they come.\u201d Comment on this\nassertion\u2014in particular, consider whether it is somehow\nself-contradictory (how?). 26.\nFURTHER READING\nThere is a massive literature on the philosophy of science and\nthe project of constructing science from observations and\nlogic. An overview of the issues very briefly mentioned in this\nchapter can be found in Peter Godfrey-Smith\u2019s Theory and\nReality (University of Chicago, 2003) and virtually any\ntextbook on the philosophy of science.\nThomas Kuhn\u2019s book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n(University of Chicago, 1962) has been enormously\ninfluential. There are also multiple overviews of his argument\navailable on the internet, including a useful entry on\nWikipedia.\nA more radical view of scientific progress can be found in Paul\nFeyerabend\u2019s Against Method (New Left Books, 1975). As his\ntitle suggests, Feyerabend argues that there is no scientific\nmethod, and our best bet is to try a very broad range of 148 | FURTHER READING\napproaches to understanding the world and see what\nhappens\u2014\u201canything goes\u201d is his slogan. PART VII\n7. SOCIAL\nCONDITIONS OF\nKNOWLEDGE\nImagine having the opportunity to spend a year studying\nabroad. Of course, many students do this, and they experience\nlife in nations and cultures around the world. They learn what\nit is like to live in another culture. They make new friends,\nadopt the local language, celebrate local holidays, learn what\nthe traditions are, and perhaps learn a new version of what\nis regarded as \u201ccommon sense.\u201d Travel broadens the mind by\nteaching us how much of our mental lives is due to just being\nin one culture rather than another.\nWe might also try to imagine what it would be like to \u201cstudy\nabroad\u201d in other cultures throughout history. Imagine\nspending a year in Mesopotamia five thousand years ago or\nin Ancient Rome or in the Mayan Empire or in Japan in the\n12th century. Such experiences would broaden the mind to an\neven greater extent since the \u201ccommon sense\u201d of these cultures\nwould be so radically different from anything we know or can 150 | 7. SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF KNOWLEDGE\neven imagine. The locals would regard us as bizarre, strange-\nthinking aliens, and we would have to work extremely hard\nto learn what to say, what to assume, what to eat, and what\ncustoms we had to follow. Going to school\u2014if there were\nschools\u2014would raise another cluster of problems as we would\nhave to catch up on the strange (to us) things our companions\nalready knew, and we would have to get a sense for what the\n\u201cproblem space\u201d of knowledge was. Were there gods or magical\nforces we need to take into account? Is there a creation story\nthat plays an explanatory role? What sorts of questions can we\nraise, and what questions would be weird or offensive to ask?\nAfter spending a year in another historical culture so radically\ndifferent from our own, we might be shocked when we\nreturned home. What once seemed familiar would seem\nextraordinary. What seemed so obvious would now seem novel\nand arbitrary. We might try to imagine all the difficulties a\nfriend from the other culture would have as they tried to adapt\nto our world\u2014what they would find weird, baffling, or\nridiculous.\nOne thing is for sure: the study of other cultures, present and\npast, helps us to learn the importance of social conditions for 7. SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF KNOWLEDGE | 151\nknowledge, which include all of the things we would find\nsurprising as we hop from one culture to another.  27.\nOBSERVATIONS ARE\nTHEORY-LADEN\nAn important lesson we would learn through our imagined\nstudy-abroad experience is that it is hard to speak at length\nabout anything without making it obvious that we have a\nparticular theory about the world. Imagine walking down the\nroad three thousand years ago with your northern African\nfriend, Akil:\nYou: Boy, is it hot today! The sun is really beating\ndown.\nAkil: It is indeed! It\u2019s a good thing Re is so powerful.\nYou: Re? Oh, yeah, the sun. Why is it good that Re is\npowerful?\nAkil: At night Re goes beneath the land to battle the\nforces of chaos. If he didn\u2019t fight so fiercely, we would\nhave many more problems\u2014food shortages, rebellions,\nfighting, you name it. Re\u2019s power helps to make sure life\non the land continues as normal.\nYou: I agree the sun is really important. It sends 154 | OBSERVATIONS ARE THEORY-LADEN\nenergy to our planet, warming our atmosphere and\ngiving the plants energy to grow.\nAkil: You talk so funny! You make it sound like the\nsun is just a big disk of fire.\nYou: It is\u2014or at least a big fire sphere, many times\nbigger than the earth. And it doesn\u2019t move \u201cbeneath the\nland.\u201d It\u2019s just that the earth turns and makes it look as\nif the sun is moving.\nAkil: Obviously not! (He holds his hand up against\nthe sun\u2014or Re.) While Re is massive and powerful, I\nwould guess he is about a half setat in size\u2014plenty big\nenough to give the forces of chaos a good fight! And I\ndon\u2019t know why you would think the land is moving.\nDo you feel it moving? In your view, why would a big\nsphere of fire care about us and make the plants grow\nand keep our life free from chaos?\nYou: The sun just burns. It doesn\u2019t care about\nanything. It just does what it does. Look, sometimes\nchaos happens, right? Even when the sun is shining?\nAkil: Sure. The battles go back and forth, and\nsometimes the forces of chaos get an upper hand but\nnever for long. How would you explain the fact that\nchaos is always defeated? How do you explain how the\n\u201csun\u201d in your view helps plants to grow?\nYou: It\u2019s complicated. Chaos gets defeated just\nbecause\u2014well, there are many different cases, but wars\nhave to end sometime, and peace has to happen. People OBSERVATIONS ARE THEORY-LADEN | 155\njust get tired of fighting, I guess. Plants grow because of\nphotosynthesis\u2026\nAkil: Foto Sin Theseus? Is he one of your gods?\nWe can imagine the discussion going much further and\nbecoming ever more complicated as you and Akil try to fathom\nhow you can both look at the one thing and see such different\nthings. You see a massive star fueled by nuclear fusion, and Akil\nsees a divine person whose energy and concern for life infuses\neverything. In this sense, what each of you sees embodies a\ncertain theory you believe. Philosophers call this \u201cthe theory-\nladenness of observation.\u201d It means that every observation\ncarries some sort of theory along with it. The observation is\nconnected to a background theory about what the observation\nis an observation of. More formally, we may say that\n\u201cobservations are theory-laden\u201d means that the terms or\nconcepts used in the observation have their meanings by virtue\nof some background theory.\nObjection: But surely not all observations are\ntheory-laden. There is a clear sense in which both we\nand Akil, in our imagined example, are seeing the same\nthing. We are both seeing a very bright disk in the sky,\nright? And then each of us has more to say about it. Akil\nsays it is a sky-traveling divine person, while we say it is a\nhuge, distant, uncaring star. But both of us will at least\nagree on the basic observation, right? 156 | OBSERVATIONS ARE THEORY-LADEN\nPerhaps this is so. But note that neither you nor Akil would\ncount the claim \u201cThe sun is a very bright disk in the sky\u201d as\nknowledge. Akil would say the claim is false, and perhaps even\nsacrilegious. You would insist that the claim is literally false, as\nthe sun is not a disk, not very bright (relative to other stars),\nand not in the sky. But still, we might say, would you not\nboth agree that the sun looks like a very bright disk in the sky?\nPerhaps, but you would both quickly explain that looks can be\ndeceiving, and the truth is more complicated. So, if the claim\nis to count as an observation, it counts only as a misleading\nobservation.\nIn other words, any claim that we confidently count as\n\u201cknowledge\u201d will be a claim that is tangled up with quite a lot\nof theory. The theory is in large part, if not entirely, a product\nof culture. Remember from the last chapter that, according\nto the scientific method, much of our scientific knowledge\nconsists of hypotheses we have developed as we try to explain\nthe natural world. These hypotheses do not develop in a\nvacuum but are drawn from our background learning, our\ncommunity with other scientists, and our sense of what the\nscientific project is all about. In the imagined dialogue, for\nexample, Akil\u2019s question about why a big sphere of fire would\n\u201ccare\u201d about us will seem to us like a wrong-headed OBSERVATIONS ARE THEORY-LADEN | 157\nquestion\u2014not the sort of question we are likely to pursue as\na research project\u2014since the very idea of astronomical objects\nlike stars having \u201cconcerns\u201d is well beyond the sorts of\nquestions we are encouraged to ask. This sense we have about\nwhich questions are of the right sort and which ones are\nwrong-headed has very much to do with what we conceive the\nscientific project to be. That one question Akil raises says a\ngreat deal about the great distance between his worldview and\nour own. 28.\nPERNICIOUS\nBACKGROUND\nTHEORIES\nEngland in the 19th century was proud of its scientific attitude\nand achievements. Steam engines, calculating machines,\nautomated factories, and advances in medicine gave the\nVictorians much to brag about. Theirs was an age of\ndependable, fruitful, scientific knowledge. They knew, for\nexample, that women are, by nature, weaker than men in mind\nand spirit and are prone to chemical and psychological\nimbalances. When excited by too much activity or difficult\nthought, women typically become hysterical, which is a\npsychological and physiological condition brought on by the\nsensitive nature of their reproductive organs. The only\ntreatment is decreased activity, less exposure to new ideas, and\ndoses of opium as prescribed by more rational men. Similarly,\nit was clear to the Victorians that evolution had endowed the\nEnglish with greater skills and grit which had led to an empire\non which the sun would never set as it had spread around the\nglobe. Other races clearly had not evolved to an equal degree, PERNICIOUS BACKGROUND THEORIES | 159\nand it was the obligation of the white Europeans and\nAmericans to help lead the lesser races to further degrees of\ncivilization\u2014for their own good, of course.\n[From Wikipedia: \u201cThis cartoon depicts a representation of\nRudyard Kipling\u2019s famous poem \u2018The White Man\u2019s Burden.\u2019\nOriginally published in February of 1899, the poem\u2019s\nphilosophy quickly developed as the United States\u2019 response\nto annexation of the Philippines. The United States used the\n\u2018white man\u2019s burden\u2019 as an argument for imperial control of\nthe Philippines and Cuba on the basis of moral necessity. It\nwas now the United States\u2019 moral duty to develop and\nmodernize the conquered lands in order to help carry the\nforeign barbarians to civilization.\u201d]\nThe Victorians used these \u201cscientific theories\u201d regarding sex,\nrace, biology, psychology, and evolution as justification for a 160 | PERNICIOUS BACKGROUND THEORIES\nwide array of oppressive practices. But only in a few cases did\nknowledgeable people knowingly use these theories as some\nsort of \u201ccover\u201d for justifying racism and sexism. Rather, in\nmost cases, knowledgeable people really believed they were\nseeing the world through clear lenses of science. They thought\nthey were seeing women and people of color as they really were,\nor as nature had evolved them to be. It was perhaps regrettable\n(they might say) that nature was so unfair, giving so many\nbenefits to some segments of humanity while leading other\nsegments so backward and incapable, but that was why it was\nthe duty of the superior humans to help along the inferior\nhumans. As 19th-century scientists studied the physiologies,\npsychologies, and social structures of women and people of\ncolor, they \u201csaw\u201d what their background theories told them to\nexpect to see: weaker, inferior creatures who could not help\nbeing who they were.\nThis is a clear case of observations being shaped and skewed\nby background theories that were pernicious and horrible. It\nis worth taking a moment to imagine what it would be like to\nbe the target of these practices and theories. It would not only\nbe the experience of sexism and racism, which is bad enough.\nThe racism and sexism would be built into the culture: in\nthe schools, in the medical books, in the training of all\nprofessionals, in popular lectures and newspaper articles, all\npromoted in just the way any scientific theory of atomic PERNICIOUS BACKGROUND THEORIES | 161\nelements or electrical power would be promoted. Any woman\nor a person of color who believed themselves capable of doing\nwhat white men could do would be denying scientific fact,\nbeing irrational, and refusing to believe what observations\nplainly show. Their rebellious attitude would be seen as a\nproblem that needed fixing, either through drugs or through\nconfinement in a prison-like asylum which would restore the\ndeluded person back to \u201chealth.\u201d And there would be no court\nof higher appeal to hear this person\u2019s case as the entire society\nwas equally \u201cenlightened\u201d by the science of the day. Everything\nin society would be telling a woman or person of color that\nthey were crazy or stupid not to see themselves as inferior\nhuman beings.\nWe should all be grateful that we know better now (even while\nwe also recognize that the legacies of these prejudiced views\ncontinue to shape practices and institutions). But if we stop\nat that point of gratitude, then we have not learned the full\nlesson. The full lesson is that the results of science always can\nbe shaped and skewed by the prejudices, biases, superstitions,\nand inequalities of society. Or is it more accurate to say that the\nresults of science always will be shaped and skewed by societal\nprejudice? For the only way in which science can be saved from\nthese prejudices is if active steps are taken to confront and\nchallenge those prejudices in the society at large. An individual\nscientist or group of scientists cannot merely resolve to try 162 | PERNICIOUS BACKGROUND THEORIES\nhard not to be prejudiced. The Victorian scientists, after all,\nwere trying very hard to be impartial and fair, and we can see\nwhere that led them. Rather, the societal prejudice as a whole\nmust be challenged in order for the science that reflects that\nsociety not to be prejudiced.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 The White Man\u2019s Burden Judge 1899 \u00a9 Victor Gillam is\nlicensed under a Public Domain license 29.\nMORALITY OF\nKNOWLEDGE\nThis brings us to a range of important and difficult questions\nthat connect our interest in knowledge with our interest in\nmorality and social justice. We have seen that it is either\nimpossible or extremely difficult for a society\u2019s knowledge not\nto reflect the society\u2019s own prejudices. Theories are shaped by a\nhost of factors, and the attitudes and values of the surrounding\nsociety are counted among them. So, as a society begins to\nconfront its own moral prejudices or skewed values, what\neffect should that have on the society\u2019s pursuit of knowledge?\nShould the pursuit of knowledge be constrained by a society\u2019s\nmoral concerns? Or should knowledge be left to grow without\nrestrictions or limits?\nThe German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920) famously\ndeclared that science is itself \u201cvalue-free,\u201d meaning that science\nnever tells us what should happen but only what happens. A\nscientist can detail the process of nuclear fission and explain 164 | MORALITY OF KNOWLEDGE\nwhat happens, but it is not the scientist\u2019s job to tell anyone\nwhether they should build nuclear reactors or nuclear\nweapons. The scientists just tries to determine what is true; it\nis up to the rest of society, or its leaders, to decide what to do\nwith that knowledge.\nWe might explore Weber\u2019s claim a bit further by considering\nthe career of the German rocket scientist, Wernher von Braun.\nVon Braun engineered V-2 rockets, which killed thousands of\nBritish civilians, for the Nazis. He was a member of the Nazi\nparty, wore an SS uniform, and was certainly aware that the\nrockets were being built by slaves in German concentration\ncamps. Yet at the end of World War II, all was apparently\nforgiven as the US was keen to have him among their\nscientists. One might try to exonerate von Braun as a scientist\njust doing his job. As the songwriter, comedian, and social\ncritic, Tom Lehrer, once sang sarcastically:\nDon\u2019t say that he\u2019s hypocritical!\nSay, rather, that he\u2019s apolitical.\n\u201cOnce the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?\nThat\u2019s not my department!\u201d says Wernher von Braun.\nBut this works only as sarcasm. Von Braun was not simply\ndoing science under a regime that only happened to be the MORALITY OF KNOWLEDGE | 165\nNazis. Being a Nazi was interwoven with the research he was\ndoing. Indeed, his job as a scientist was to make deadly rockets\nto aid a monstrous political engine. This helps to demonstrate\nthe more general point that science does not develop in some\nsealed environment that is insulated from society at large.\nScientists are raised in societies and their attitudes are deeply\nshaped by those societies. Scientists do not \u201cleave themselves\nbehind\u201d when they walk into the lab but carry with them their\nown attitudes, beliefs, conceptions, and prejudices.\nWe know from history that this can lead to very biased and\ninaccurate science. This means that ways in which a society\u2019s\nmorality can distort our beliefs should not merely concern us\nfor moral reasons but also for epistemological ones. If we are\ninterested in learning what is true, we should be concerned\nabout the ways in which our society\u2019s moral values distort our\nknowledge. In other words, if Wernher von Braun wanted an\nundistorted understanding of rocketry, he would have done\nwell to pay some attention to how the rockets were being built\nand where they were meant to come down.\nObjection: But that\u2019s clearly not true in the case\nof Wernher von Braun. He was a true expert in rocket\nscience, and while greater moral concern makes anyone\na better human being, it is not at all obvious that greater 166 | MORALITY OF KNOWLEDGE\nmoral concern would have made him or anyone more\nknowledgeable about rocket science.\nThis is a good point. Still, one might ask whether the push\namong all technological nations for more advanced ballistic\nweapons was informed by moral concerns or by concerns to\nintimidate other nations and channel public funds into\ndefense industries. Suppose, as a thought experiment, that the\npush had been to design missiles that could transport food\nand medical supplies to distant regions, with a possibility of\nre-using the rockets. If that had been the objective, would\nrocketry have developed even further than it did when the\nobjective was only destructive?\nThis consideration is not mere fantasy. In fact, once Wernher\nvon Braun became an American citizen, he became a very\nstrong proponent of using rockets to travel safely into space.\nHe continued to work on projects for the US military but\nwith greater moral reservations and far less enthusiasm. One\nmight argue that his later work, particularly with the Apollo\nprogram, generated far superior knowledge of rocketry because\nthe objective was not restricted to better ways to blow up\ndistant targets but to the more difficult task of sending humans\ninto space without killing them. That\u2019s a lot harder to do and\nrequires greater knowledge. MORALITY OF KNOWLEDGE | 167\nThe point of reviewing von Braun\u2019s story is to suggest that\nthe moral beliefs of a surrounding society determine how\nindividuals see their world, what they value in it, which\nprojects are possible or encouraged, and which are not.\nThough, clearly, it is not impossible to learn more about the\nworld even in a thoroughly immoral society, a society that is\nmore open to dialogue and to changing its moral attitudes will\nallow for a greater range of efforts to gain knowledge. A free\nsociety allows for free knowledge. 30.\nTHE OPEN SOCIETY\nKarl Popper (1902-1994) was a philosopher who wrote on\nboth scientific knowledge and politics. His most famous work\nwas a two-volume book entitled The Open Society and Its\nEnemies (1945). Popper\u2019s claim was that, all through history,\nsocieties that are run by elites who take themselves to have\nmore valuable knowledge than other people always end up\nbeing repressive tyrannies. Plato\u2019s beloved republic was\nsupposed to be run by philosopher kings, and in this society,\nPopper notes, there is state censorship, noble lies, eugenics,\nand very little human freedom. Hegel\u2019s society, Popper argued,\nrequires individuals to subordinate their own interests and\nbeliefs to the plans of an Absolute Spirit that worked through\nwhomever happened to be king; and this unquestioning\nobedience, combined with the faith that God is behind\nwhatever the state is doing, helped to make the rise of National\nSocialism possible in Germany. Marx believed that in the\ntransition from capitalism to communism, there would need\nto be an interval when authorities controlled everything and\nre-educated the masses; this idea led to Stalinism. In general, THE OPEN SOCIETY | 169\nPopper argued, whenever people set themselves up as knowing\nbetter than others, an oppressive tyranny results.\nPopper\u2019s alternative is the open society. An open society is one\nin which people are free to think as they like and say what\nthey think. People are free to criticize one another\u2019s claims\nand ask for evidence and for justification. No one inherently\nhas a greater claim to the truth. Each individual has the right\nto employ their own reason to determine their beliefs. A\ndemocracy is the best form of government for such a society\nas it allows for free and equal participation by all citizens.\nObviously, in such a democracy not everyone will get their\nway, but everyone will have the chance to offer their own view,\nand a view will become dominant only by winning over the\nmajority of citizens. So long as citizens are encouraged to\nexercise their own critical rationality, asking for evidence and\njustification and deciding on views that seem best supported\nby available knowledge, the society will generally follow the\nbest available suggestions. Mistakes will be made, but no worse\nthan what happens in any alternative to an open society.\nThis is obviously only the beginning of a rich discussion in\npolitical philosophy, but what is important for our purposes\nis the way Popper links epistemic autonomy with social and 170 | THE OPEN SOCIETY\npolitical freedom. Epistemic autonomy is an individual\u2019s\ncapacity to use their own reason and experience in determining\nwhat is true. The opposite would be being told what to believe\nwithout sufficient evidence or reason\u2014belief at the point of\na gun, in other words. Epistemic autonomy both leads to and\nresults from social and political freedom. It leads to social and\npolitical freedom in two ways. First, individuals with epistemic\nautonomy want to have for themselves the freedom to use their\nreason and determine their own beliefs, and preserving this\nfreedom for themselves will mean also preserving it for others\n(at least, so long as they do not regard themselves as having\nspecial privileges). Second, individuals may discover that the\nbest way to use reason and evidence in determining their\nbeliefs is through free and open dialogue with others, since\nothers will have reasons and evidence that the individuals had\nnot considered.\nBut it is also true that epistemic autonomy results from social\nand political freedom. If we allow citizens a maximal set of\nrights\u2014in the words of John Rawls, a set of rights that is as\nbroad as can be while extending the same rights to everyone\nelse\u2014then individuals will need to determine for themselves\nhow they act, how they live, and what they believe. This is\nepistemic autonomy.\nObjection: This is all well and good so far as it goes. THE OPEN SOCIETY | 171\nBut even in self-professed free societies, there can be\npropaganda and persuasive advertising and all sorts of\nways to manipulate people\u2019s beliefs. People may think\nthey are epistemically autonomous when, in reality, they\nare being manipulated by powerful political or\ncorporate interest groups.\nPopper would hasten to agree. But how do we fight against\nsuch manipulation? Appointing some small group of people\neither to be in charge or to determine what public knowledge\nshould be would only make the situation easier for those who\nseek to manipulate society to their own ends, for the\nmanipulators now need not try to convince a majority of\ncitizens but only the small group in charge. The best antidote\nto bad information is more information, Popper would say.\nOver time, the information that is more accurate will prevail\nover misinformation.\nBut let us consider a harder case in which citizen\u2019s freedoms\nmight be seen as threatened by having more information. For\nmany years in the U. S., standardized test scores have favored\nsome groups of people over others. Males tend to outperform\nfemales, and Asian students outperform other racial or ethnic\ngroups. This is normally regarded as indicating both biases\nin the tests and differences in the educational experiences of 172 | THE OPEN SOCIETY\npeople in these groups. But a few researchers have claimed\nthat the differences in the test scores remain even when one\ncompensates for the tests\u2019 biases and the differences in\nexperience. In other words, some portion of the difference in\ntest scores, they claim, really just has to do with the differences\nin sex or race or ethnicity. Some groups of people are smarter\nthan others, at least according to the measurements of these\ntests.\nNow suppose the view of this minority of researchers were\nto turn out to be true. Suppose there were some measurable\ndifference in intelligence between these groups of people.\nSuppose we could set aside all of the well-founded concerns\nabout standardized tests, disparities in education, and so on,\nand suppose there really turned out to be such a difference\u2014a\nsmall difference, perhaps, but a genuine difference. It is a\ndifficult conceptual possibility for us to confront because we\nknow how such a result would be deployed in the service of\nsexism and racism. Elite college admissions and high-level\nemployment opportunities would be skewed towards\nprivileged groups\u2014for after all, don\u2019t we want the best and\nbrightest in these spots? And people would be shut out from\nopportunities over factors over which they had no control\nsuch as their sex or race. We might well worry that all of the\nhard work that has gone into the struggle for equality of THE OPEN SOCIETY | 173\nopportunity among historically disadvantaged groups would\nbe wiped away with such a research discovery.\nWith that in mind, would it be wiser for researchers to\nsuppress their discovery? If they saw that the discovery would\nbe used to justify sexist or racist policies, would they not be\nmorally obliged to block that discovery from becoming\nknown?\nDefenders of the free society would say that the discovery\nshould not be suppressed. But, of course, that does not mean\nthey would welcome sexist or racist policies. Rather, they\nmight say, the research has given us a strange and wholly\nunexpected fact that will probably require further study to\nfully comprehend\u2014but it has not given us any obvious reason\nfor dismantling any of the moral progress we have made. It\nhas been known for a long time that differences exist among\ngroups of people for whatever reason; that is obvious. But we\nhave learned to disregard those differences when it is a matter\nof social or political equality. Why should it be any different in\nthis case?\nThe more general strategy of the defenders of the open society 174 | THE OPEN SOCIETY\nis to let all information be out in the open so that it cannot\nwork behind the scenes in the dark and undiscovered. If some\ngroup of people thinks a small difference in standardized tests\nwould justify racist or sexist policies, let them bring that\nargument out into the open where it can be discussed,\nchallenged, and refuted. The alternative is to allow the\nargument to fester unspoken in individuals\u2019 minds, governing\ntheir actions without ever being brought out in public display.\nThe bright spotlight of public scrutiny will kill off the\nunreasoned beliefs and nourish the ones supported by reason\nand evidence.\nOr that is the faith of the defenders of the open society, at any\nrate. But having seen what we have seen about the rationality\nof humans at various points in our history (think particularly\nof the Victorian scientists here), we may well worry whether\n\u201cthe bright spotlight of public scrutiny\u201d always does the work\nit is supposed to do. 31.\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER\n1. If our scientific knowledge is shaped by social values and\nprejudices, then what about our moral knowledge? Is it\nbetter off in some regard? How confident can we be\nabout the moral judgments we make about Victorians,\nfor example?\n2. Popper was very confident that the open society is\ntolerant of a wide range of views but was absolutely not\ntolerant of intolerance. In other words, anyone who\nwants to shut down others in expressing their views is\nnot welcome in the open society. Is this a bug in his\nsystem or a feature?\n3. Suppose I want to be a scientist but don\u2019t want to\ncomplicate my life with all of the moral concerns\nbrought up in this chapter. I don\u2019t want to participate in\nevil; I just want to understand nature. Is there some kind\nof strategy I can follow to make sure I can do my work\nwithout worrying about its social implications? 32.\nFURTHER READING\nThe most influential author who has written about the ways\nin which knowledge is shaped by social conditions is\nundoubtedly Michel Foucault. But it is difficult to find\naccounts of Foucault\u2019s thinking that are easily approached by\nbeginners. One might begin with the entry in the Internet\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy and follow up with Gary Gutting\u2019s\nMichel Foucault\u2019s Archaeology of Scientific Reason (Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1989).\nKarl Popper, The Open Society and its Enemies, was published\nin two volumes in 1945. Discussions and summaries of it can\nbe found at several sites on the internet. It includes criticisms\nof Popper\u2019s main ideas.\nThe views of the Victorians and the ways in which their own\nsociety shaped their science, and how the science shaped their FURTHER READING | 177\nsociety, can be found in George W. Stocking\u2019s Victorian\nAnthropology (Free Press, 1987).\nA fascinating account of the ways in which social prejudices\naffected the career of an amateur botanist and suffragette can\nbe found in Tina Gianquitto\u2019s \u201cBotanical Smuts and\nHermaphrodites: Lydia Becker, Darwin\u2019s Botany, and\nEducation Reform,\u201d Isis 104 (2): 250-277 (2013).  PART VIII\n8. KNOWING OUR\nWEAKNESSES\nPsychologists, philosophers, and cognitive scientists work\ntogether to create models of the human mind in order to try\nto understand how we process information. If we want to\nunderstand knowledge, it makes sense to have some\nunderstanding of the thinking system we are working with,\neven a schematic understanding, since then we can know\nwhere our system is strong and where it is weak.\nTo that end, I would like to offer an exceedingly simplistic\nmodel of the human mind so that we can begin to think about\nhow our knowledge-gathering or belief-making process works\nand the various ways in which it can go wrong. The model I\nshall offer could be called the \u201cGuesser-Checker-Storymaker\u201d\nmodel. 180 | 8. KNOWING OUR WEAKNESSES\nThe basic idea in this model is that there are three\ndepartments in our mind, and each of them has a different job\nto do. The job of the Guesser is to make all sorts of guesses\nabout what is in our environment and even about what we\nourselves are doing. It\u2019s a wild and creative department, always\nbrainstorming new ideas that come seemingly out of nowhere.\nThe job of the Checker is to use our senses to try to determine\nif any of the guesses coming from the Guesser have any\nconnection to what we can see, hear, smell, taste, or feel. The\nmain job of the Checker is to filter out the wilder guesses 8. KNOWING OUR WEAKNESSES | 181\ncoming from the Guesser and obtain a smaller set of guesses\nthat seem possible given what we are experiencing. Finally, the\njob of the Storymaker is to take the plausible guesses and\nthe information from our senses, and our memories as well,\nand then try to fold them all together into a coherent story\nabout what is happening and what it all means. It provides the\n\u201cfinished copy\u201d of what we think we know.\nThe three departments share information and affect one\nanother. So, the Guesser might ask if we are seeing a duck on\nthe pond. The Checker swivels the eyes toward the pond and\nexamines more closely. On the basis of what the Checker sees,\nthe Guesser makes more specific guesses such as whether we\nare seeing a Mallard or a Pintail\u2014or maybe a goose or just a\nclump of sticks. Meanwhile, the Storymaker is rapidly putting\ntogether an account: \u201cI see an object that might be a duck,\nand I have seen ducks here in the past, so it is not unlikely,\nbut it\u2019s not perfectly clear\u2026\u201d and this story, as it is being made,\nfurther affects the guesses that are being made and the ways\nin which the senses are being used. \u201cIs this the same duck I\nsaw here last Tuesday\u2014the one with the funny feather sticking\nout of its head?\u2026\u201d Over time the three of them settle on a\nstory\u2014\u201cBehold! I see a duck!\u201d\u2014before moving on to new\nguesses and new jobs to do. 182 | 8. KNOWING OUR WEAKNESSES\nMost of the time the system serves us quite well. Most of\nthe time, we get things right. But there are also many ways\nin which the system can malfunction, leading to surprising\nresults. Imagine what happens when the Checker does not\nhave good access to the sense instruments\u2014perhaps because\nthe senses are \u201coffline\u201d (as they are when we are sleeping) or\nbecause their functioning has been affected by poor\nconditions, prismatic glasses, or hallucinogenic drugs. The\nGuesser keeps guessing away with all sorts of wild guesses\nabout what\u2019s going on, and the Checker does its best to\nconfirm or disconfirm the guesses. But its functioning is\nimpaired, so it is not very accurate. The Storymaker tries to\nkeep up with the Guesser and the Checker, trying to weave\ntogether a coherent story from the information being\nprovided. The result is a dream, or an LSD trip: objects keep\nturning into different objects (as the Checker keeps confirming\nwild guesses), and the story seems to make some sense at the\ntime, but later on (when we are relaying the story to others),\nit will seem very strange and incoherent as the plot seems to\nkeep changing. For example, at first I am looking at a duck on a\npond, but then the duck is actually my brother, and we need to\nget to the airport because we are late for a flight. But the airport\nhas no doors, and I am burdened with an enormous orange\nsuitcase\u2026\nOr imagine a very intense and dangerous experience like 8. KNOWING OUR WEAKNESSES | 183\ngetting into a fight or getting mugged. All three systems are\nworking quickly and furiously, fueled by adrenaline, looking\nfor immediate threats and escape routes and frantically coming\nup with the best idea of what to do next. In the heat of the\nmoment, the Checker may not take the time to notice what\nthe other people are wearing or whether they have a beard\nor whether they are tall or short, the Storymaker may not be\nkeeping record of the precise order of events as they unfold,\nand the Guesser may be screaming out all kinds of wild ideas\nin the hope of producing something that will help. Later on,\nwhen we tell our friends or the police about what happened,\nit may be hard to remember exactly how things went down,\nwhat the other person looked like, what they were wearing,\nor why we said the things we said. Eyewitness testimony is\nnotoriously unreliable for this reason: the memories are made\nunder extremely adverse circumstances.\nOr imagine a Storyteller that does not pay attention to the\ninformation that is being provided by the other two\ndepartments. The Storyteller is totally occupied in putting\ntogether a story, perhaps one of events from the past or\nimagined events of the future, and it is putting together all\nsorts of details and consequences and flourishes. The Guesser\nis guessing away, as usual, and the Checker is checking away,\nas usual, but none of the information is being taken up by\nthe Storyteller since the Storyteller is totally absorbed in its 184 | 8. KNOWING OUR WEAKNESSES\nown project. Then, a message suddenly comes through from\nthe Checker: it appears we have been asked a question, and\neveryone around us is looking at us expectantly. What has been\ngoing on? We have no idea since the Storyteller has not been\npaying attention. We have been daydreaming. Things\nhappening before our very eyes and ears have left no\nimpression on us at all, though nothing was wrong with our\nChecker, and perhaps we were even nodding along with what\nother people were saying, though not keeping track of what\nwas being said.\nGenerally, our cognitive system works very well. After all, it\nhas served us well enough to allow us to survive this long in\nour evolutionary story. But its complicated nature means that\nit can malfunction from time to time. Moreover, it may be\n\u201cengineered\u201d to perform some tasks very well and others not\nvery well at all. For example, perhaps our cognitive system\nworks really well at processing information and maintaining\nsocial life in a small group of hunters and gatherers living on\na savanna, but perhaps it does not do so well when asked to\nmemorize passages and recite them backwards or to estimate\nprobabilities.\nEven apart from the various sorts of malfunctions described 8. KNOWING OUR WEAKNESSES | 185\nabove, it seems our thinking system does tend to make\nrecurring sorts of mistakes in ordinary circumstances. We can\ncall these mistakes fallacies, or ways of processing information\nthat do not reliably yield true beliefs. We will consider seven\nsuch fallacies and also use our simplistic model of the mind\nto diagnose how these patterns of mistakes come to be made.\nThen, we will see if we can draw an interesting general\nconclusion from these fallacies and some guiding advice for\nsteering clear of them.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Figure 8.1 \u00a9 Charlie Huenemann is licensed under a CC\nBY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license  33.\nSEVEN FALLACIES OF\nHIGHLY-HUMAN\nTHINKERS\nMany sources have identified a host of fallacies we are prone\nto commit, but much of the discussion stems from a highly\ninfluential book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, by Daniel\nKahneman. Kahneman provides his own list of fallacies we are\nprone to use. The following list overlaps a bit with his but also\noffers some other fallacies that seem to me very common and\nmore relevant to this introduction to epistemology.\n1. Anchoring. The thing we learn first often has an overly\nstrong effect over the rest of what we learn, and we make\ndecisions about what to accept or reject on the basis of that\nfirst thing. For example, perhaps we learn from Grandpa that\nthe candy store charges too much, and thereafter, we insist that\nthis is true. Every bit of contrary evidence that comes in (\u201cBut\nthe chocolate bars are, in fact, cheaper than anywhere else!\u201d)\nis brushed aside as just a fluke, or a ploy by the candy store\nto lure in more customers and then overcharge them for other 188 | SEVEN FALLACIES OF HIGHLY-HUMAN THINKERS\nitems. But what reason or evidence do we have for believing\nthat the candy store is so devious? Really, it is just that we first\nlearned one thing from grandpa, and then we stuck with it.\nOur Storymaker makes the first thing a crucial element in the\nstory and uses it as a criterion for deciding what else to add to\nthe stories we make. But of course, it can easily be that the first\nthing we hear or learn is not reliable\u2014even if it comes from\nGrandpa!\u2014and is not entitled to this kind of authority.\n2. Confirmation bias. We seem to be wired to look greedily\nfor evidence that supports whatever we already believe and\nto ignore any evidence that suggests otherwise. But this is, if\nanything, the opposite of what we would want to do if we\nwanted to be sure that what we believe is true. If we were to\ntry to follow something like the scientific method in forming\nour own beliefs, we should look instead for good evidence that\nwhat we believe is false. And if we find none, then we may\ntentatively hold on to our belief until further evidence comes\nin. This bias toward trying to confirm our beliefs seems to\nresult from the way our Checker interacts with our Guesser:\nthe Checker looks to see if a guess is correct and does not look\nfor evidence against the guess.\nOne illustration of our inclination toward confirmation bias\nis the \u201cWason selection task.\u201d We are shown the cards in the\ndiagram below. Each card has a color on one side and a number SEVEN FALLACIES OF HIGHLY-HUMAN THINKERS | 189\non the other side. We are asked to determine whether the\nfollowing rule is true: every card with an even number on one\nside is red on the other side. To determine whether this rule is\ntrue, we are allowed to turn over only two cards. Which two\ncards should we turn over?\nMost people think immediately of turning over the \u201c8\u201d card\nand the red card, probably because the rule we are thinking\nof combines even numbers and red cards. So, we want to see\nwhether that connection holds. But in fact, the only way to test\nthe rule is to turn over the \u201c8\u201d card and the brown card. The\nred card will not tell us anything because the rule does not tell\nus whether cards with odd numbers might also have red on the\nother side. The rule also doesn\u2019t tell us what happens with odd\nnumbers. The rule only says that if we have an even card, then\nthere\u2019s red on the other side. So, to test the rule, we had better\nmake sure the brown card does not have an even number on its\nother side. 190 | SEVEN FALLACIES OF HIGHLY-HUMAN THINKERS\nIt is hard for us to think this way because we are prone to think\nin terms of confirming a claim rather than disproving a claim\nor looking for contrary evidence. We look for the \u201ceven + red\u201d\ncombination to be true and do not think through what we\nwould have to see in order for it to be proven false.\n3. Dunning-Kruger effect. We tend to be more confident\nabout our own expertise the less we know about something.\nAs the philosopher Bertrand Russell said, \u201cThe whole problem\nwith the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of\nthemselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.\u201d As you might\nimagine just from its name, the Dunning-Kruger effect has\nbeen studied in research settings by psychologists and has been\nput in the form of a graph that shows the relation between how\nmuch people know about something and how confident they\nare about their knowledge: SEVEN FALLACIES OF HIGHLY-HUMAN THINKERS | 191\nSo, people who know next to nothing about a subject are\nvery confident in their beliefs about it. Then, with a little more\nknowledge, people realize that they know very little, and\ngradually, as they learn more and more, they become more\n\u201csustainably\u201d confident in their knowledge.\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect is due to both the Guesser or the\nStorymaker in our model. If a topic comes up about which I\nknow very little, my Guesser will go to work making guesses\nabout the topic. My Checker has nothing to contribute since\nthe topic is not about my immediate surroundings. My 192 | SEVEN FALLACIES OF HIGHLY-HUMAN THINKERS\nStorymaker does not have much to offer since (again) this is a\ntopic about which I know very little. So, the guesses I make will\nget a \u201cfree pass,\u201d particularly if they happen to cohere nicely\nwith somewhat-related beliefs I already have. No resistance is\noffered by any component of my cognitive system, and so I\nfeel very confident of my guesses, like I am an expert. But in\nthis case, my so-called knowledge really consists only in my not\nknowing any better.\n4. In-group bias. We give greater weight to the experiences\nand reports of those who belong to our groups. The people in\nour groups are friends, family members, or co-workers whom\nwe know and trust; it is hard for us not to trust and believe\nthem. So, for example, I might read study after study that\nshows that vaccinations prevent disease, but the fact that my\nmother\u2019s second cousin became extremely sick after receiving\na vaccination when she was a little girl outweighs all of the\nevidence of the studies, and my entire family is set against any\nvaccinations as a result. Or, for another example, if I see on\nsocial media that all of my friends seem to share a political view,\nit will be difficult for me not to want to share that view with\nthem. I trust them; they are like me; how can I disagree with\nthem?\nBut of course anyone can be wrong, and some of these people\nmay be our friends and family. There are excellent reasons for SEVEN FALLACIES OF HIGHLY-HUMAN THINKERS | 193\ntrusting family and friends, but such strong trust becomes a\nliability in cases where what our group says is at odds with\nwhat stronger evidence suggests. In terms of our model, in-\ngroup bias seems closely related to Anchoring. The\nknowledge of what my group believes does not have to come to\nme first, but I give it a stronger voice or greater authority than\nother beliefs or considerations that come my way because it is\ncoming from my group. My Storymaker regards it as a \u201cvital\nelement\u201d to the story because my group, and belonging to my\ngroup, is a vital element of my story.\n5. Out-group anti-bias. This comes along with in-group\nbias but is important enough to merit special attention. Just as\nwe are likely to place too much trust in those who belong to our\ngroup, we are likely to place not enough trust in those outside\nour group. This is clearly demonstrated by the level of hostility\non the internet toward people who are not in our groups.\nAnything that supports an outside group is seen as a threat\nto our group. The reasoning and evidence that supports the\nviews of an outside group is rarely considered impartially and\nhonestly, just as support for the views of our group is seldom\nsubjected to critical assessment. Both in-group bias and out-\ngroup bias are products of an \u201cus vs. them\u201d mentality which\nskews our reasoning and ultimately puts us all in a weaker\nposition with regard to knowledge. Forming epistemic groups\nmakes us all ignorant. 194 | SEVEN FALLACIES OF HIGHLY-HUMAN THINKERS\n6. Availability heuristic. It is difficult for us to\ncontinuously process all the information that comes our way.\nOne shortcut for processing it is to make a \u201csnap\u201d judgment\nthat what we are experiencing fits some sort of model or\ntemplate (or heuristic) that we already have available. An\nobvious example of this is employing a stereotype, or making\nuse of a ready-made list of characteristics in order to make\njudgments about an individual on the basis of their race, sex, or\nethnicity. Unfortunately, our culture provides a very handy set\nof heuristics to use in judging people which allow us to draw\nfalse conclusions rapidly and easily.\nGenerally, in the \u201cavailability heuristic\u201d fallacy, we adopt a\nmodel for understanding a problem or question in the hope\nof securing a fast and easy solution, but that model might not\nbe the best one to use. We might insist that a certain stock\nvalue has to fall because \u201cwhat goes up must come down.\u201d In\nthis case, we have assumed that stock values follow the same\nlaws as projectiles. Or we might be afraid to swim in the ocean\nbecause we just watched a string of films about shark attacks.\nIn this case, we have assumed that the films we watched\nprovide a good model of what typically happens when people\nswim in the ocean. Or we might disparage a scientist who\nspeaks with a certain accent because people with that accent\nare depicted in movies as being uneducated. In this case, we\nare assuming that movies provide accurate models of some SEVEN FALLACIES OF HIGHLY-HUMAN THINKERS | 195\nimplausible connection between accents and intelligence.\nIn our model, this is the Storymaker\u2019s fault. Rather than take\nthe time and effort to compose an accurate story from the\navailable information, the Storymaker slaps on some handy\nstory that is available and moves on to the next task.\n7. Barnum effect. This effect is named after the great\nAmerican huckster P. T. Barnum. Barnum realized that, in\ntrying to deceive someone, you can count on the other person\nto meet you halfway. In some cases, we join in the effort to\ndeceive ourselves\u2014perhaps because we are being sold a\nflattering story or because the misinformation being presented\nto us fits so neatly with preconceived opinions we hold or\nallows us to draw conclusions we are already eager to draw. On\nsome topics, we really don\u2019t mind being fooled.\nThis is seen most clearly in the business of telling fortunes or\nwriting horoscopes. The fortune teller only needs to provide\na vague outline, and most people will fill in the details for\nthemselves. I can demonstrate this to you by showing off my\nown psychic powers: I know you, the person reading this book\nright now. You feel a strong need for other people to like and\nadmire you. You have a great deal of unused capacity which 196 | SEVEN FALLACIES OF HIGHLY-HUMAN THINKERS\nyou have not yet turned to your advantage. You pride yourself\nas an independent thinker and do not accept others\u2019 statements\nwithout satisfactory proof. Yet, at times, you have serious doubts\nas to whether you have made the right decision or done the right\nthing.\nAre my psychic powers not astounding?! But of course those\nlast four sentences apply to anyone and everyone. If you were\nthinking about them as you read them, you probably thought\nof features in your life that fit the description. That is natural\nsince, as we try to understand anything, we think about how\nthe new information fits with what we already know. If the\n\u201cnew\u201d information is about us, and if it is suitably general\nand vague, we will have no difficulty in thinking of ways in\nwhich the information fits with our knowledge of\nourselves\u2014particularly when the information sounds\nflattering\u2014and we are deceived into believing that someone\nelse has uncanny knowledge of our own private lives.\nBut the fallacy does not happen only in the presence of fortune\ntellers. Our Guesser and Storyteller love to fill in the blanks\nin any explanation. If someone provides us with a partial\nexplanation, we will automatically start to fill in the gaps with\nwhatever guesses seem to us to be plausible or to fit our other SEVEN FALLACIES OF HIGHLY-HUMAN THINKERS | 197\nbeliefs or suspicions. But this means that significant parts of\nthe story we end up with have been invented by us and may\nhave no real connection to the truth.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Figure 8.2 Huenemann \u00a9 Life of Riley is licensed under\na CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) license\n\u2022 Figure 8.3 is licensed under a Public Domain license 34.\nREFLECTION ON THE\nFALLACIES\nObviously, we fall prey to more than just those seven fallacies.\nBut seven turns out to be the most popular favorite number,\nand clearly, it is not any sort of fallacy (such as \u201cwishful\nthinking\u201d) to believe that our favorite number must be\nepistemologically significant, right?\nThese fallacies might be understood as consequences of the\nlifestyle we evolved to have. For most of our existence, homo\nsapiens have lived in small hunting and gathering groups. We\nforge strong bonds with other members of our group and\nshow a certain amount of suspicion, or outright hostility,\ntoward strangers. Life has been precarious with bad weather,\nfood shortages, predators, and disease, so naturally we try to\nestablish a lifestyle that is as predictable, as familiar, and as\nfree of surprises as possible. It has been a matter of life or\ndeath for us. And so, the \u201cevolved advice\u201d has been to stick to\nwhat is familiar, what has worked in the past, what the rest of REFLECTION ON THE FALLACIES | 199\nour group believes, and whatever encourages us to stay within\nthe group. And on the other hand, we reject what is strange,\nforeign, new, or comes from groups we don\u2019t know. Most or\nall of our fallacies can be tied to this mindset.\nThere is no arguing with success. This evolved advice has\nworked well for most of our existence. But of course we live in\na radically different world now, one that we have not evolved\nto live in. Our groups are much bigger and spread across the\nglobe; food comes to us from a complicated and intricate\nsupply chain, and medicine is, for many of us, readily available;\nand our knowledge of the world and of ourselves is\nenormously more advanced, and many of the problems we face\nrequire difficult, scientific and technological thinking. Our\nsurvival in today\u2019s circumstances requires that we out-think the\nways of thinking burned into us over evolutionary time, which\nis a hugely difficult challenge. We know better. Now we have to\nconvince ourselves of that fact.\nBut how are we supposed to do this? How can we slow down\nor alter a style of thinking we have evolved to use? No simple\nremedy is available, but I will offer here four questions we\nmight try to habitually ask ourselves to try to diminish the\npower that these fallacies exert over our thinking. 200 | REFLECTION ON THE FALLACIES\n1. What is my line of reasoning? Sometimes making our\nthinking explicit is all it takes to make us realize it is\nfallacious. \u201cWhy am I going back to that same restaurant\nafter just having had three bad experiences eating there?\u201d\nAnswer: \u201cBecause it would be really convenient for me\nto be able to go to that restaurant, and whatever would\nbe convenient for me is likely to be true \u2026 oh, right, bad\nidea!\u201d\n2. Where did I get that idea? This question is useful only\nif you can be very honest with yourself. Was it from\nGrandpa? Did you get this idea from something you\nread? Or someone you had a conversation with? On\nsocial media? Or some weird philosophy professor? Is it\nimpossible for that source to be wrong, or for you to\nhave misunderstood what the source said? If you do a\nlittle research, can you find better evidence for thinking\nthe idea is wrong or, at least, not obviously right?\n3. How would things look if I were wrong? This is an\nextremely useful question to ask, and we will discuss it\nfurther when we come to Bayesian reasoning. Ask\nyourself what evidence you would be seeing if what you\nare insisting on is false. Then, ask yourself if that is, in\nfact, what you are seeing. So, for example, suppose you REFLECTION ON THE FALLACIES | 201\nhave ended up believing that the Moon landing never\nhappened and all the reports and records of it are fake.\nNow try to imagine what you would be seeing if you\nwere wrong about this, and people actually did land on\nthe Moon. You would be seeing everything you in fact\nare seeing\u2014video footage, recordings, books, movies,\naccounts in textbooks, and so on. There may also be\nsome minor inconsistencies in the historical accounts or\nsome fuzzy photographs since these commonly happen\nin all cases. Would you still also be seeing a small group\nof people steadfastly refusing to believe that people\nlanded on the Moon? Yes, probably. You can pretty\nmuch always count on their being some small group of\npeople denying what\u2019s true no matter the topic. This\nsmall exercise in imagination should be enough to lead\nyou to think that there\u2019s a good chance you are wrong.\n4. How does this belief make me feel? This might seem\nlike an odd question to ask, but if you try to answer it\nhonestly, it might reveal what motivates your belief. If\nthe belief you are considering does not really make you\nfeel one way or another, that is probably good news. For\nwhen our emotions are not exerting their powers over us,\nwe are more likely to come to an unprejudiced\nassessment of the evidence. On the other hand, if the\nbelief makes you feel important or sort of thrilled or\nimpassioned or like you are an extremely special person, 202 | REFLECTION ON THE FALLACIES\nthen watch out! For it may be your desire to feel those\nemotions that is pulling you toward that belief more\nthan any evidence or line of reasoning. Now, obviously,\nwe can be wrong about emotionally-neutral\ninformation, and we can be right about ideas that excite\nus. But when strong feelings are attached to what we\nbelieve, we would be wise to slow down and consider\nmore carefully what our line of thinking really is.\nAsking ourselves these four questions will not counteract\nevery line of fallacious thinking, and we may not always be\nable to ask ourselves these questions or answer them honestly.\nBut they may help us to steer clear of the seven fallacies we\ndiscussed, in the following way: siht em\nekam\nseod ?leef\nx x x x\nwoH feileb\nsgniht\nerew\n?gnorw\ndluow\nI\nfi x x x x x x\nkool\nwoH\nteg\n?aedi\nI\ndid\nx x x x x x\nerehW taht\nym ?gninosaer\nfo\nsi\ntahW enil x x x x x\ntceffe\nsaib-itna citsirueh\nsaib\nsaib tceffe\ngnirohcnA regurK-gninnuD\nnoitamrfinoC\npuorg-nI\npuorg-tuO ytilibaliavA munraB 35.\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER\n1. Do you have any examples from your own experience of\nany of the errors described in this chapter? If you are\nhuman, you probably do! Please offer that example,\nexplaining clearly why it was an instance of some\nparticular fallacy.\n2. A very common fallacy that is not listed in this chapter is\nthe fallacy of appealing to authority. It seems that the\nfact that Mr. Popular endorses Smile-eeze toothpaste\nshould not rationally persuade me that Smile-eeze\ntoothpaste is good for my teeth. But, as we all know, we\nhave to rely on experts to give us information about the\nweather, medicine, load-bearing structures, and so on.\nHow would you characterize the fallacy of \u201cappeal to\nauthority\u201d to allow the good appeals to authority and\ndisallow fallacious appeals to authority? After you offer\nthat characterization, develop a solid objection or\ncounterexample to it. 36.\nFURTHER READING\nThe Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\u2019s entry \u201cFallacies\u201d\noffers a good overview of questions that can be raised about\nproviding lists of named fallacies. It also presents a list of 230\nnamed fallacies with brief descriptions and examples.\nDaniel Kahneman\u2019s Thinking Fast and Slow (Farrar, Straus\nand Giroux, 2011) offers an illuminating discussion of two\nways we think: in a faster mode with quick conclusions, and in\na slower mode in which we carefully articulate each step along\nthe way. We seem to be better at fast thinking, but fast thinking\nis unreliable in any complicated situation.\nHugo Mercier and Dan Sperber\u2019s The Enigma of Reason\n(Harvard UP, 2017) argues that the biases humans are prone\nto in reasoning are corrected when humans argue together in\ngroups, and that reasoning is a social \u201csuperpower\u201d rather than\none belonging to individuals.  PART IX\n9. HOW TO ARGUE\nWITH OTHER\nPEOPLE\n\u201cMan: An argument isn\u2019t just contradiction.\nMr. Vibrating: It can be.\nMan: No it can\u2019t. An argument is a connected series of\nstatements intended to establish a proposition.\nMr. Vibrating: No it isn\u2019t.\nMan: Yes it is! It\u2019s not just contradiction.\nMr. Vibrating: Look, if I argue with you, I must take up a\ncontrary position.\nMan: Yes, but that\u2019s not just saying \u2018No it isn\u2019t.\u2019\nMr. Vibrating: Yes it is!\nMan: No it isn\u2019t!\u201d\n\u2014 Monty Python, \u201cArgument Clinic\u201d (1972)\nUnfortunately, we do not lack examples of people arguing\nwith one another. What we lack are examples of people arguing\nconstructively with one another. But how can arguing be\nconstructive? Isn\u2019t any argument essentially a competition in\nwhich each side is trying hard to win and not to lose? 208 | 9. HOW TO ARGUE WITH OTHER PEOPLE\nWe should begin by introducing the philosophical sense of the\nterm \u201cargument.\u201d According to the philosophers, an argument\nis not a competition between people who believe different\nthings. An argument is instead a set of reasons (called premises)\nthat are supposed to lead to a conclusion. If they really do lead\nto the conclusion, the argument is said to be valid, it works.\nAnyone who disagrees with the conclusion will then have to\nfind fault with one of the premises leading to the conclusion.\nHere is an example of an argument:\nAnyone who is either a philosopher or a scientist believes\nin truths that go beyond what experience can show. For\na philosopher believes that there are proper definitions of\nterms, like truth or justice, and a scientist believes in the\nlaws of nature, which are generalizations that go beyond\nthe particulars of sense experience.\nIs it a valid argument? To determine this, we need to\ndetermine what claim is being argued for (the conclusion),\nand what reasons are being presented for it (the premises). In\nthis case, the conclusion is the first sentence: \u201cAnyone who is\neither a philosopher or a scientist believes in truths that go\nbeyond what experience can show.\u201d Then, the second sentence 9. HOW TO ARGUE WITH OTHER PEOPLE | 209\ngives us two reasons for thinking that the conclusion is true:\n\u201cFor a philosopher believes that there are proper definitions\nof terms, like truth or justice\u201d (that\u2019s reason or premise #1),\nand \u201ca scientist believes in the laws of nature, which are\ngeneralizations that go beyond the particulars of sense\nexperience\u201d (that\u2019s reason or premise #2).\nThis argument is valid, and the following, painstaking re-\nordering of the argument will make it clear exactly why it is\nvalid:\n(Premise #1): A philosopher believes that there are proper\ndefinitions of terms, like truth or justice (and we should add\nhere something that is pretty obviously being presumed,\nnamely that what makes definitions \u201cproper\u201d is something\nthat goes beyond what experience is able to show).\n(Premise #2): A scientist believes in the laws of nature,\nwhich are generalizations that go beyond the particulars\nof sense experience (so they quite literally go beyond what\nexperience is able to show).\n(Conclusion): Therefore, both philosophers and\nscientists believe in truths that go beyond what experience\nis able to show.\nIf we drop out all of the information and pay attention only\nto the structure of what is being said, the argument looks like 210 | 9. HOW TO ARGUE WITH OTHER PEOPLE\nthis: All of the Ss are Bs, and all of the Ps are Bs, so all of the\nSs and Ps are Bs. It is not a thrilling argument, but it is a valid\nargument. The two premises that are offered do in fact lead to,\n(or imply) the conclusion.\nSo, there is no arguing with the logic of the argument. If\nsomeone wants to resist the conclusion\u2014let\u2019s say they are a\nscientist who hates being put into the same group as\nphilosophers\u2014then they will have to reject one or both of the\npremises being offered. Perhaps they will deny that scientists,\nwhen they believe in the laws of nature, are believing in truths\nthat go beyond what experience shows. If that is the case, then\nwe will return to the discussion in chapter 6 of this book, raise\nthe problem of induction, and our discussion continues. Or\nperhaps someone thinks philosophers are not concerned with\nproper definitions but are instead concerned with other things\nthat do not go beyond what experience shows. In that case, we\nshall have to ask what this person thinks philosophy is, and our\ndiscussion continues.\nEither way\u2014and this is the point\u2014our discussion continues.\nThe understanding of the initial argument has helped us to\nfocus more precisely on where we disagree. Is it about what\nscientists believe or about what philosophers do? So, the 9. HOW TO ARGUE WITH OTHER PEOPLE | 211\ndiscussion not only continues but continues in a constructive\nway since we are learning more about the different views and\nthe reasons for holding the different views, or about the exact\nnature of the disagreement between people. This sort of result\nseldom comes from the shouting matches that are often\nrecognized more popularly as \u201carguments.\u201d\nA philosophical argument is a cooperative effort to understand\nthe reasons behind our disagreements. Sometimes the result\nis that a simple misunderstanding is cleared up. Sometimes\none side ends up persuading the other because the reasons are\nmade clearer, and on the basis of those reasons, someone is\nconvinced that they should change their mind. Sometimes no\none changes their mind, but everyone has a clearer picture of\nwhere other people are coming from or what their lines of\nreasoning are. Every result is an advance from where we were\nwhen we started.\nThere is a science of logic, or the exact nature of the ways\nin which premises lead to conclusions (or validity). It is\nextremely important not only in philosophy, but in\nmathematics, information science, and, really, any endeavor in\nwhich people are trying to extract more specific information\nfrom the information that is given. You should take a class in 212 | 9. HOW TO ARGUE WITH OTHER PEOPLE\nlogic if you haven\u2019t already. But we cannot cover all of that\nmaterial in this textbook, so we will turn to something that\nis just important: how to argue with people philosophically\nso that our arguing is constructive and illuminating, not just\nfrustrating and tiresome.\nTaking the time to reorganize premises and conclusions in the\npainstaking way we just did, making everything transparently\nobvious, is hardly ever practical in daily life (though it is\nfrequently done in philosophical essays). And, as was just said,\nlogic is a science unto itself. But we can examine the attitudes\nwe should be bringing to philosophical arguments and learn\nfrom them some lessons about the ethics of knowledge. 37.\nARGUMENTS AS\nOCCASIONS FOR\nLEARNING\nThe great Socrates (c. 400 BCE) argued that philosophical\narguments never disappoint. His line of reasoning might be\npresented as follows: any two people either have knowledge\nabout something, or they do not. If they both have knowledge,\nthen they will agree, and they will not need to argue. If one\nof them has knowledge and the other does not, then the one\nwith knowledge will teach the other. If neither of them has\nknowledge (but perhaps they falsely think they do), then a\nphilosophical argument will soon demonstrate to both of\nthem that, in fact, they do not have knowledge\u2014which will\nbe an improvement upon falsely thinking that they have\nknowledge. So, in all cases, philosophical arguments lead to\nsomebody\u2019s improvement.\nIn Socrates\u2019s own case, he had been told by an oracle of the\ngods that he was the wisest of all humans. He could not see 214 | ARGUMENTS AS OCCASIONS FOR LEARNING\nhow this could be true, so he went to the reputed experts of\nhis day to try to find someone who was wiser that he was.\nWhat he found was that many people were regarded as wise,\nand regarded themselves as wise, but in reality did not have\nany wisdom. In the end, he thought that he was the wisest of\nall humans only in the sense that he knew he had no wisdom\nwhile so many other people falsely believed that they had\nwisdom when they didn\u2019t. In that regard, he was wiser than\nthey were.\nSocrates\u2019s arguments with the alleged experts were of the third\nsort mentioned above. Neither Socrates nor the alleged expert\nhad knowledge, and the argument showed this to be true. Or\nit was supposed to show this. Very often the alleged experts\nrefused to admit their own ignorance, and they began to regard\nSocrates as an annoying pest. He was eventually accused of\nimpiety and corrupting the youth, and at his trial, he refused\nto stop doing what he was doing:\nGentlemen of the jury, I am grateful and I am your friend,\nbut I will obey the god rather than you, and as long as\nI draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to practice\nphilosophy, to exhort you and, in my usual way, to point\nout to any one of you whom I happen to meet: \u201cGood\nSir, you are an Athenian, a citizen of the greatest city with\nthe greatest reputation for both wisdom and power; are ARGUMENTS AS OCCASIONS FOR LEARNING | 215\nyou not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much\nwealth, reputation, and honors as possible, while you do\nnot care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth or the\nbest possible state of your soul?\u201d Then, if one of you\ndisputes this and says he does care, I shall not let him go\nat once or leave him, but I shall question him, examine\nhim, and test him, and if I do not think he has attained the\ngoodness that he says he has, I shall reproach him because\nhe attaches little importance to the most important things\nand greater importance to inferior things. (Plato\u2019s Apology,\n29d-30a)1\nIt is a beautiful and moving speech. Of course, Socrates\nwas in a life-or-death situation (which unfortunately ended\nup being death for him). We are not typically in that sort of\nsituation. But there is something in Socrates\u2019s general attitude\nthat is worthy of emulation. His attitude is that we should\nplace a very high value on truth and that we should not be\nafraid of being wrong. We should enter into conversations and\narguments about what is true and be willing to admit when we\nare wrong since then we will have learned something.\nThis Socratic attitude fits nicely with the \u201copen society\u201d\nenvisioned by Karl Popper (as we saw in chapter 7). In an\n1. Plato, \u201cApology,\u201d in Plato: Five Dialogues, (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1981). 216 | ARGUMENTS AS OCCASIONS FOR LEARNING\nopen society, we are free to think as we please and say what\nwe think. We are also free to criticize or object to what others\nsay. Along with these freedoms, though, comes a responsibility\nto be reasonable and value the truth and admit to our own\nmistakes. An open society in which everyone just blabs\nwhatever they wish to blab about will not be much of a society\nto be proud of. But one in which everyone is exchanging ideas\nand engaged in reasonable discussion of those ideas\u2014in short,\nan open society in which everyone adopts the Socratic\nattitude\u2014would be a truly great society. 38.\nBEING FAIR, AND EVEN\nGENEROUS\nOnce we shift our attitudes about arguments and view them\nas occasions for learning and not as competitions, we will find\nthat we do not have to mean or dismissive to our opponents.\nIndeed, we should not be mean to them, and we should not\nthink of them as \u201copponents,\u201d for they may turn out to be our\nteachers. We should at least regard them as friends, which is\nwhat Socrates typically does in Plato\u2019s dialogues.\nWith that in mind, we will want our friends to present the\nbest arguments they can, even when we disagree with their\nconclusions. We want this because we want to discover the\ntruth. If we let our friends slide by with less forceful\narguments, we may well miss an opportunity for learning\nsomething. Ideally, we want our opponents to be as rational,\nclear, and persuasive as possible so that we do not miss out on\nwhat they know. As J. S. Mill (1806-1873) once wrote, \u201cLord,\nenlighten thou our enemies. Sharpen their wits, give acuteness 218 | BEING FAIR, AND EVEN GENEROUS\nto their perceptions, and consecutiveness and clearness to their\nreasoning powers: we are in danger from their folly, not from\ntheir wisdom; their weakness is what fills us with\napprehension, not their strength.\u201d We want our \u201cenemies\u201d to\nbe as wise and clear and perceptive as possible, for they are not\nreally our enemies, properly speaking. Ignorance or foolishness\nare the true enemies. If we want to learn the truth, we want\neveryone to be as sharp and perceptive as possible.\nThe contemporary philosopher Daniel Dennett has suggested\nthree rules to follow when we criticize someone else\u2019s\nargument:\n1. You should attempt to re-express your target\u2019s position\nso clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says,\n\u201cThanks, I wish I\u2019d thought of putting it that way.\u201d\n2. You should list any points of agreement (especially if\nthey are not matters of general or widespread\nagreement).\n3. You should mention anything you have learned from\nyour target.\nOnly then are you permitted to say so much as a word of\nrebuttal or criticism. BEING FAIR, AND EVEN GENEROUS | 219\nNote that this does not necessarily mean saying that the other\nperson\u2019s conclusion is right. Sometimes we are encouraged to\ninteract with others in such a way that no one is ever said to\nbe wrong about anything, and everyone is right, and we should\nall hold hands and give thanks for each other\u2019s company. It\u2019s\na nice thought, perhaps, and of course we should always be\nkind and respectful to others. But we can respect others and\nfollow Dennett\u2019s suggested rules while still disagreeing, raising\nforceful objections and criticisms, and insisting that the other\nperson\u2019s view is false. It is tricky, to be sure, since no one ever\nlikes being told that they are wrong. (Well, Socrates seems not\nto have minded.) But the truth is at stake. And if the truth\nmatters, then we are not doing anyone any favors by saying\nthey are right when they are not.\nThe trick is to show respect and even kindness while\ndisagreeing and making clear exactly where our disagreement\nis. This is what Dennett\u2019s rules are about: being fair and\ngenerous to one\u2019s partner while also being as clear as possible\nabout what is right, what is wrong, and why. This is the ideal\nof a philosophical argument. 220 | BEING FAIR, AND EVEN GENEROUS\nIt is one thing to understand the ideal and quite another to be\ngood at achieving it. It is hard to be fair to those we disagree\nwith and to refrain from making all of the unfair but\ndevastating and clever remarks we might make at their expense.\nBut whenever possible, we should view each argument as a trial\nwith the very best lawyers appointed for each side. We want the\n\u201cprosecution\u201d to be aggressive in putting together the evidence\nand arguments for their side, and we want the \u201cdefense\u201d also to\nassemble the evidence and arguments effectively for their side.\nSometimes we have to switch back and forth between serving\nas prosecutor and as defense attorney as we try to make each\nside as compelling as possible. 39.\nFRIENDLY ADVERSARIES\nMany court systems are adversarial. What this means is that\nthe court features two \u201cteams,\u201d a prosecution and a defense.\nEach team tries its utmost to persuade a judge or jury that what\nthey are saying is true. The prosecution tries to prove beyond\nany reasonable doubt that someone is guilty of having broken\nthe law, and the defense tries to show that there are reasonable\ndoubts about that person\u2019s guilt and that the prosecutors have\nnot proven their case. The article of faith that justifies such\na context is that there is a truth about the person\u2019s guilt or\ninnocence, and the truth, or the facts, will enable one side or\nthe other to provide a more compelling case to a judge or jury\nthat is rational and impartial.\nIt is a noble ideal, and there are many ways in which our\nsystems can fail to live up to it. Prosecutors might be\nextraordinarily talented and compelling orators who can\npersuade a jury to see things their way even when the truth\nis not on their side. The same goes for defenders who might\nbe able to encourage great sympathy for the accused person or 222 | FRIENDLY ADVERSARIES\nsuggest grounds for doubt where really there should be none.\nEvidence can be fabricated or lost on purpose. And the judge\nor jury may not be impartial but may have their own interest\nin either convicting someone or letting them go free.\nBut it is hard to think of a better system. Imagine systems\nof \u201cjustice\u201d that are based on some other contest. We could\nlet the accuser and the accused engage one another in armed\ncombat or in an arm-wrestling match and \u201clet God decide.\u201d\nWe could simply ask the whole community to vote on guilt or\ninnocence without working through the evidence. We could\nflip a coin. Any of these systems would generate verdicts, but\nthe problem is we have no reason to think that the verdicts that\nare generated will have any connection to whether the accused\nperson is really guilty or innocent. A system in which evidence\nand reasonable arguments are presented, and we do what we\ncan to make sure rules of evidence are followed, and everything\nis out in the open, and the judge and jury are as impartial as\nwe can practically guarantee, is a system that should generate\nverdicts that line up with actual guilt or innocence.\nPhilosophers tend to see their own disputes as very much like\nthe adversarial system used in courts of law. Arguments are\npresented, objections are raised, replies to the objections are FRIENDLY ADVERSARIES | 223\noffered, the adequacy of those replies are assessed, and the\ndiscussion continues. The philosophers involved in the\ndiscussion are supposed to serve as judge and jury as well,\nwhich of course can mean that they are not completely\nunbiased as they present arguments and objections and are also\nsupposed to rule on whether the arguments are compelling.\nBut philosophers know they are supposed to be impartial in\ntheir rulings, and if they fail to be impartial, we can count on\nanother philosopher to point this out quite forcefully. Daniel\nDennett\u2019s rules given above can be seen as rules that are meant\nto keep us on the straight and narrow path of impartiality.\nBut who is on trial? If we follow the example of Socrates, we\nshall say that our beliefs are on trial. A \u201cguilty\u201d verdict means\nthat the belief should go away, and an \u201cinnocent\u201d verdict\nmeans that it need not go away; the belief is defensible. The aim\nof the philosophical trial is not to put anyone in jail, of course,\nbut to help each other to have beliefs that are defensible. The\nsystem of arguments and objections is certainly adversarial, but\nthe adversaries should be friends, as they are trying to help one\nanother.\nThe same concerns raised above can be raised here: this is a\nnoble ideal which we can fail to live up to in many ways. 224 | FRIENDLY ADVERSARIES\nPhilosophers, like anyone, can become more concerned with\nscoring debate points than with getting at the truth, and some\nphilosophers can make lousy arguments seem very compelling.\nBut again, as with the court system, it is the best idea anyone\nhas for arriving at defensible beliefs.\nNote that both adversarial systems make the task of the\nprosecutor more difficult than the task of the defender. The\nprosecutor has to show that a person is guilty or that a certain\nbelief is indefensible. The defender, on the other hand, does\nnot have to show that the person is innocent or that the belief in\nquestion is true. That would be too much. In the case of courts\nof law, we make the job of the defender easier because, on the\nwhole, we would rather have a guilty person go free (which is\nbad) than have an innocent person wrongly convicted (which\nis worse). In the case of a philosophical dispute, we would\nrather have someone believe something that is false but still\ndefensible (which is bad) than face the challenge of proving\nsomething true before believing it (which is worse).\nWhy would it be worse to insist that we believe only what is\nproven to be true? Because, as we have seen through our study\nof skepticism, this will mean never being allowed to believe\nanything! We were able to escape the clutches of severe FRIENDLY ADVERSARIES | 225\nskepticism only by allowing ourselves to have beliefs that are\ndefensible, or at least beliefs that fit with the other things we\nbelieve. While it is perhaps a comforting fantasy to imagine\nhaving iron-clad arguments for everything we believe, that is\nonly a fantasy, and the bulk of human life as we know it is\nlived in a wide range between things we are sure are false and\nthings we are sure are true. (Would it really be comforting to\nhave iron-clad arguments? My own suspicion is that such a\nlife would be bereft of stimulating doubts, wonderings, and\npossibilities!) 40.\nHELPING THE\nDISCUSSION TO\nCONTINUE\nHaving spent some decades leading philosophical discussions\namong undergraduates, I have come to appreciate the\ntremendous value in helping the discussion to continue. It\u2019s not\nsimply because a teacher needs to keep students active for the\nlength of the class. Rather, it seems to me that keeping a\ndiscussion alive and interesting is an effective way to teach two\nlessons that are otherwise impossible to teach: (1) that there are\nother views we had not thought of, and (2) that we can keep\ntalking even though we disagree. These are important lessons\nfor everyone to learn, for it is when we each think we have the\nonly rational perspective and there\u2019s no use in talking about it\nthat civil society breaks down.\nIt is difficult to help discussions to continue, and it takes a\nmasterful teacher to do it well. I am not a masterful teacher in\nthis regard, and I admire those teachers who can accomplish HELPING THE DISCUSSION TO CONTINUE | 227\nthe task. It requires allowing different views to develop while\nalso keeping the discussion somewhat focused and progressive\nas it evolves from one question to the next. If it is done well,\nthen a wide array of relevant perspectives are explored, but\neveryone feels as if the central questions have become clearer\nand more meaningful. A skillful teacher can work in real time\nto combine insights from various students and shape the\ndiscussion toward (what the teacher suspects will be) a fruitful\noutcome.\nThe same discussion-leading attitude can be carried out of\nthe classroom and into all argumentative situations. People\ninvolved in arguments, in real life or in comment threads on\nthe internet, are often concerned only to score points and win\nwith bonus points awarded if the opponent is left crying and\nashamed. Needless to say, in such a game the rational pursuit\nof truth is not likely to fare well. The results will only be\nhurt feelings, resentment, and greater stubbornness. But if the\nobjective is not to score points and win but to help the\ndiscussion to continue, then a conversation begins to resemble\na small-scale version of Popper\u2019s open society (as discussed in\nchapter 7). In this small society of discussion, we encourage\nthe expression of a wide range of ideas and subject each idea\nto critical questions and problems but now with an aim to\ndevelop the conversation further and enlarge our\nunderstanding. Again, such discussions are not ones in which 228 | HELPING THE DISCUSSION TO CONTINUE\neveryone is right and no one ever says anything that is wrong\nor false, but the discussion allows for corrections to be made or\narguments to develop in such a way as (once again!) to help the\ndiscussion to continue.\nThe skill of helping discussions to continue is hard to gain, and\nwe often will fail at the task. But, like most skills, we get better\nat it the more we practice. And if we are committed to being\ngood epistemic agents, not to mention good human beings,\nthis is a skill very much worth developing through continued\npractice. 41.\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER\n1. Suppose you are arguing with someone who has a belief\nthat is morally repugnant (for example, that people with\nlow IQs are slaves by nature). Should you really follow\nDennett\u2019s advice and try to \u201cre-express your target\u2019s\nposition so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target\nsays, \u2018Thanks, I wish I\u2019d thought of putting it that\nway\u2019\u201d? If so, why? If not, where do you draw the line\nbetween following Dennett\u2019s advice and not following\nit?\n2. An experiment: find a suitable comment thread on the\ninternet\u2014not one that gains nobody\u2019s attention, and\nnot one that is huge, but one in which individuals are\nlikely to reply to one another\u2019s comments. Try to engage\nwith the comments constructively, following the rules\nDennett offers. Report your results. 42.\nFURTHER READING\nPlato. \u201cApology.\u201d In Plato: Five Dialogues. Translated by G.

BAYESIANISM\nAND WHAT IS\nLIKELY\nOur beliefs are not static. Ideally, our beliefs will change as\nnew information becomes available. Otherwise, we are\nunreasonably stubborn. But our beliefs should not always\nchange since the new information might not matter, or it\nmight not be trustworthy. \u201cA wise man proportions his belief\nto the evidence,\u201d David Hume once intoned, but it does take\nsome special sort of wisdom to know exactly how to\nproportion our beliefs to the evidence.\nIn a way, this is the central, practical problem in knowing: how\nshould I revise my beliefs when new information comes in?\nWhen should I find new information compelling, and when\nshould I be skeptical? When should I change my mind, and\nwhen should I hold fast? Anyone who has a good method for\nfiguring this out would be an expert knower. 232 | 10. BAYESIANISM AND WHAT IS LIKELY\nIn fact, there is a method available for figuring this out\u2014at\nleast, in a wide range of cases\u2014and that is what this chapter is\nabout. The method is Bayesianism. But it is a little tricky to\nunderstand, so we will have to take some care in building up\nto it. We will begin by considering David Hume\u2019s discussion\nof miracles and when it is rational for someone to believe the\nreport of a miracle. 43.\nDAVID HUME AND\nMIRACLES\nWe have encountered David Hume before when we were\ndiscussing the problem of induction. Hume is known as a\ngreat skeptic because of this problem and because he did not\nthink there is a rational solution to it. But Hume was far from\nan irrational philosopher. He believed that once we admit that\nhuman beings are conditioned to expect that nature will\ncontinue to follow the patterns it has followed in the past, we\ncan begin to think more carefully about what we should or\nshould not believe given the patterns of our past experience.\nHe knew that sometimes we can be surprised when nature\ndoesn\u2019t do what it is expected to do. But such surprises are rare\n(thank goodness!), and we ought to be careful when we hear\nfrom someone else that some surprising event has happened.\nAs Hume recognized, we all make our judgments on the basis\nof our past experience. He tells the story of \u201can Indian prince\u201d\nwho was told by some visiting Europeans that where they came 234 | DAVID HUME AND MIRACLES\nfrom, water freezes in the winter. The prince had never\nexperienced or even heard of such a thing. In his experience,\nwater was always liquid, and the idea that it could turn into\na solid that people could walk on seemed ludicrous. Yet here\nwere strangers in his court claiming that water could become as\nhard as stone. The prince faced a choice: he could believe these\nstrangers and accept the seemingly outrageous claim that water\ncan turn into a solid, or he could continue to believe what all of\nhis previous experience showed\u2014that water was, is, and always\nshall be liquid\u2014and suspect these strange newcomers as trying\nto pull a fast one on him.\nWhat is the rational thing to believe? We know the truth: water\ncan freeze. But when we ask what is rational for the prince to\nbelieve, we are asking what he should believe given his previous\nknowledge and experiences. The idea that water turns solid\nwas totally \u201cunprecedented\u201d in his experience (he had no\nevidence of it having happened before). But the idea that\nstrange people from strange lands might be less than truthful,\nor might even make up astonishing things in an attempt to\nimpress him, was not at all unprecedented. Maybe for a prince\nat that time it was even a common occurrence. So, Hume\nobserved, the prince \u201creasoned justly\u201d when he concluded that\nwater does not freeze and that these visitors were not telling the\ntruth. DAVID HUME AND MIRACLES | 235\nWe can see in this case a kind of rational weighing. Imagine\na balance scale. On one side we put the likelihood that water\nfreezes; on the other side we put the likelihood that strangers\ntell false and fantastic stories. The second likelihood was\ngreater according to the prince\u2019s experience and weighed more,\nso the balance was tipped in favor of denying the strangers\u2019\nclaims.\nHume went on to consider a pair of more complicated cases.\nSuppose we find historical reports that say that on the first of\nJanuary in the year 1600 there was darkness over the whole\nEarth for eight days. Now that is quite a claim, and if it were 236 | DAVID HUME AND MIRACLES\njust a single report, we would be wise to suspect that the report\nwas false. But suppose it is not just a single report. Suppose\nthat as we gather reports from around the world, from all sorts\nof societies, we find the same thing being reported in different\nlanguages and in different calendar systems. The reports all\nagree on the details: eight days of darkness beginning on the\nfirst of January 1600 (as Europeans reckon it). In this case,\nHume thinks, we would be rational to accept the truth of the\nreports, and we should then start trying to figure out what\nstrange sort of eclipse or weather phenomenon might explain\nthe eight-day darkness.\nWhy should we accept the reports? Consider again the\nweighing analogy. On the one side we put the claim that the\nwhole world was covered in darkness for eight days. That is\nquite extraordinary. On the other side we put the claim that\nindependent societies around the world all came to report the\neight-day darkness, even though, in fact, the world was not\ncovered in darkness for eight days. That is also quite\nextraordinary. But which is more likely or less extraordinary?\nIn Hume\u2019s estimation, it is more unlikely that observers from\naround the world would all agree on something that did not\nhappen than that some strange astronomical event or weather\nevent happened. It\u2019s more likely that something weird\nhappened in nature than that all of these reports would be\nfalse. DAVID HUME AND MIRACLES | 237\nBut here is the second case Hume considers. Suppose we\nare reading records from English history and we find reports\nthat on the first of January 1600, Queen Elizabeth died and\nwas confirmed dead by court physicians. A successor was put\non the throne, as would usually happen in such cases. Then,\nthe reports say that, one month later, the queen arose from\nthe dead, resumed the throne, and governed England for three\nmore years. The records, let us presume, are the sorts of records\nhistorians typically rely on as they try to trace all the details of\nEnglish political events.\nWhat is rational for us to believe in this second case? We might\nthink that it is like the eight days of darkness and that we ought\nto accept that nature does some pretty wild things sometimes,\nincluding bringing British monarchs back from the dead. But\nHume writes that he would not have the \u201cleast inclination\u201d to\nbelieve the reports. Why not? Hume answers that \u201cI should\nnot doubt of her pretended death and of those other public\ncircumstances that followed it: I should only assert it to have\nbeen pretended, and that it neither was, nor could possibly\nbe real.\u201d In other words, Hume thinks it more likely that\nsomething tricky was going on. The queen\u2019s death was faked,\nand her resurrection was faked, possibly to gain some sort of\npolitical advantage, for who would not be faithfully obedient\nto a queen who arose from the dead?! 238 | DAVID HUME AND MIRACLES\nSo, in this case we are weighing the possibility of real death and\nreal resurrection one month later from being dead against the\npossibility of some rather large-scale hoax being perpetrated\non the English public. It is difficult to perpetrate such a large-\nscale hoax. But that is nothing compared to the difficulty of\nresurrecting someone who has been truly dead for a month.\nSo, Hume concludes, it is far more likely that there was a hoax\ndue to \u201cthe knavery and folly of men\u201d than that the queen\ntruly arose from the dead.\nWhy doesn\u2019t Hume also suspect a hoax in the eight days of\ndarkness case? We might consider just how massive and\ndifficult such a hoax would have to be. How would you trick\npeople from different societies all around the world to believe\nthat the world was dark for eight days? Or perhaps we need\nnot go that far. Perhaps we only need a dedicated team of\nhoaxers to infiltrate every society around the world and doctor\nall the records to make it seem as if there had been eight days of\ndarkness. But either way, that is a truly massive hoax. At some\npoint it becomes more likely to judge, in this case, that the\nstrange event really happened than that such a hoax happened.\nBut the English hoax is not nearly so massive. We perhaps need\nonly a dozen people to agree to a cover-up operation and keep DAVID HUME AND MIRACLES | 239\nquiet about it. That is difficult, to be sure, but (again) not\nnearly so difficult as resurrecting someone from the dead.\nObjection: But we should remember\nthe Indian prince and the fact that\nhe came to the wrong conclusion\nabout water freezing into ice.\nPerhaps in the right circumstances\npeople can be resurrected after\nbeing dead for a month.\nHume would grant the objection. Nature certainly can be\nsurprising. But, like the prince, we can only make judgments\nabout what is rational for us to believe given our previous\nexperience. The prince was rational to deny the reports of the\nvisitors given his previous experience. We are similarly rational,\ngiven our experience, to deny the queen\u2019s resurrection. Of\ncourse, we might be wrong. But, given our experience, there is\ngoing to have to be a lot more evidence to make the death and\nresurrection of the queen more likely than the possibility of a\nhoax.\nHume discusses these three cases while arguing for what was,\nin his day, an extremely radical and dangerous claim: that a\nrational person should not believe in the miracles reported in 240 | DAVID HUME AND MIRACLES\nthe Bible. The Bible presents reports of extraordinary events\nlike a flood covering the entire globe, the Red Sea parting,\nangelic visitations, resurrections, and so on. The Bible itself is\na collection of ancient documents written by various people\nat different times, and none of the extraordinary events are\ncorroborated by any other texts. We typically do not believe\nother ancient texts, like Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey, when they\nreport the interventions of the gods or visits to the underworld\nor creatures like Circe or the Cyclops. Why, then, should the\nBible be treated as any more truthful in such matters than any\nother ancient text that describes similarly extraordinary events?\nHume puts his point quite forcefully (and exhibiting an anti-\nsemitism which was all too common, even among so-called\nEnlightenment thinkers):\nHere we are first to consider a book, presented to us by\na barbarous and ignorant people, written in an age when\nthey were still more barbarous, and in all probability long\nafter the facts which it relates, corroborated by no\nconcurring testimony, and resembling those fabulous\n[fable-like] accounts which every nation gives of its origin.\n[\u2026] I desire any one to lay his hand upon his heart, and\nafter a serious consideration, declare whether he thinks the\nfalsehood of such a book, supported by such a testimony, would DAVID HUME AND MIRACLES | 241\nbe more extraordinary and miraculous than all the miracles\nit relates \u20261\nThe last point which I have put into italics demonstrates\nwhat Hume is weighing as he considers whether to believe the\nBible\u2019s reports of miracles. On one side, we have the possibility\nthat the reports are false. On the other side, we have the\npossibility that all those events really happened and have been\naccurately described. Which is more probable? We have plenty\nof examples of ancient texts (and not-so-ancient texts)\npresenting false accounts. There is nothing extraordinary\nabout this. But the events being reported\u2014the flood, the\nparting of the sea, and so on\u2014are about as extraordinary as any\nreport could possibly be. Indeed, they are deemed as miracles,\nmeaning events that are never observed to happen in the\nordinary course of nature. In Hume\u2019s view, we should not\nhesitate to deny the Biblical reports.\nHume offers a general rule to follow in all these cases we have\nbeen examining: \u201cThat no testimony is sufficient to establish\na miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind that its\nfalsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it\n1. David Hume, An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (Indianapolis:\nHackett, 1993). 242 | DAVID HUME AND MIRACLES\nendeavours to establish.\u201d In other words, don\u2019t believe the\nreports of an extraordinary event unless the falsehood of that\nreport would be even more extraordinary than the event it\nreports.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Likelihood Scale adapted by Charlie Huenemann is\nlicensed under a CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike)\nlicense 44.\nBAYESIANISM\nWe can now use what we have seen in Hume\u2019s discussion to\nunderstand the basic idea of Bayesianism. In all the cases\nHume discusses, he asks us to use our previous experience of\npeople\u2019s behavior and the workings of the world when we try\nto decide whether to believe a report. The Indian prince bases\nhis decision on his own previous experience, the eight days of\ndarkness case asks us to consider just how hard it would be to\nhoax the whole world, the Queen Elizabeth case asks us how\nhard it would be to hoax a smaller public, and the Bible case\nasks us how strange it would be for an ancient text to report\nthings that did not happen. All of these cases require us to\nfirst consider what we first take to be generally true from our\nexperience and then to assess the new information in relation\nto that general experience. Paraphrasing Hume, we ask\nwhether the falsity of the new information would be more\nextraordinary, given our experience, than believing what the\ninformation says, given our experience.\nThis is the core of the Bayesian method. The method is named 244 | BAYESIANISM\nfor Thomas Bayes (1701-1761), an English mathematician,\nphilosopher, and minister. Instead of viewing events as\nprobable or improbable on the basis of how frequently they\nhappen, Bayes asked how confident we should be about some\nnew bit of information given our other beliefs, or what degree\nof probability we should place on the new information. It is\ntherefore a subjective view of probability since it focuses not on\nthe \u201creal chance\u201d of an event happening but on how likely we\nshould think such an event is.\nBayes expressed his method through a precise mathematical\ntheorem. We will not need to delve into that theorem to\nunderstand what the core idea is (in case you are interested,\nthe theorem is given and explained briefly at the end of this\nchapter). But Bayes\u2019 theorem is most often explained in terms\nof a situation in which someone is being tested for having a\ncertain disease, and some math is always used in these cases.\nIn the interest of providing a general introduction to\nBayesianism, we will take the time to work through one of\nthese typical medical cases to see how it works. Then, we will\nmake the underlying idea more general.\n1. A medical example\nSuppose Patrick has been exposed to some rare but frightful\ndisease. Only one person in a thousand has it. He has not BAYESIANISM | 245\nshown any symptoms, and has no other reason to think he\nactually has it, but he is worried, and so he goes to a doctor\nto be tested. Alas, the test comes back positive. He wants to\nknow how accurate the test is. The doctor carefully explains\nthat the test is accurate 90 times out of 100, and only generates\nfalse positive results in 5 cases out of 100. It is the worst day of\nPatrick\u2019s life, for he now believes he has a 90% chance of having\nthis terrible disease.\nBut should Patrick be this concerned? This is where Bayes\u2019\ntheorem does its work, and the results are surprising.\nOrdinarily, before any tests or anything else, how worried\nshould Patrick be about having this disease? Only one person\nin a thousand has it, so Patrick should not be worried very\nmuch. But now his positive test result comes in, and the test\n\u201cgets it right\u201d 90 times out of 100. Following the core idea of\nBayesianism, Patrick needs to assess the test results in the light\nof his previous knowledge, namely that the disease only affects\none in a thousand.\nSo what should Patrick consider? He needs to think how this\ntest result changes his earlier guess about how likely it is he\nhas the disease. He needs to compare how likely it is he is\nin the group of people who have the disease and would test 246 | BAYESIANISM\npositive and how likely it is he is in the group of people who\ndo not have the disease but still end up testing positive. If we\nhave a million people, there will be 900 people who have the\ndisease and test positive (that\u2019s 90% of the 1,000 people who\nwill have the disease in a population of a million people). On\nthe other side, the test offers a false positive result 5% of the\ntime, which means that out of the one million people we are\nconsidering, 49,950 people do not have the disease but would\nstill test positive for it (that is 5% of the 999,000 people who\ndo not have the disease). So really, Patrick should consider\nwhich is more likely: that he is among the 900 people who have\nthe disease and test positive? Or that he is among the 49,950\npeople who do not have the disease but still test positive?\nWe are now looking at a smaller group of 50,850 people out\nof a million who would test positive for the disease whether\nthey really have it or not. Patrick should consider whether he\nis in the diseased group of 900 out of this 50,850, or in the\nundiseased group of 49,950 out of 50,850. All other things\nbeing equal, the odds of being in the first group is about 1.8%.\nThe odds of being in the second group is over 98.2%. So,\nthe positive test result tells him that he should update\nhis chances of having the disease from about a one in a\nthousand to about a two in a hundred. Admittedly, this is\na significant increase. Patrick should be more worried than he\nwas before the test. But he should not be a lot more worried. BAYESIANISM | 247\nHe certainly should not believe there is a 90% chance that he\nhas the disease!\nHere is our reasoning, laid out in a table: tahw\nrehtie %8.1~\nro\n;evitisop\nni ,058,05 ro\nsi ,058,05\n?spuorg\neh\nstset sddo fo\ntuo fo\nkcirtaP eht eseht 059,94 %2.89~ tuo\nera 009\nfo\neht )058,05\nhtiw ynam ?evitisop\n=\n000,1 woh evitisop\ntset\n,esaesid\neht\nlliw 009 tset\nfO\nohw\ntuohtiw\nelpoep\nynam\n?evitisop\nwoh fo\n000,999\nrebmun\n,esaesid\ntset\neht 059,94 latot(\nfO eht lliw\nesaesid\nerar\nwoh eht\nerar\nfo ,elpoep erar evah\nnoitalupop eht\neht ton\nevah\n000,000,1 evah od\n?esaesid 000,999 od\nesaesid\nynam 000,1\na\nnI BAYESIANISM | 249\nThis is a surprising result (and no small relief to Patrick!). It\ncomes about because Patrick is reminded that the disease itself\nis very rare, and when the rarity of the disease combines with\nthe imperfection of the test, the numbers end up being not\nas threatening as one might otherwise think. When we jump\nfrom the claim that a test is accurate 90% of the time to the\nconclusion that Patrick, testing positive, has a 90% chance of\nhaving the disease, we are forgetting about just how rare it is for\nanyone to have the disease in the first place. Once we remind\nourselves of that background knowledge, and we do our math,\nwe have a much more accurate sense of how worried Patrick\nshould be. There are over fifty times as many people who do not\nhave the disease and test positive than there are people who do\nhave the disease and test positive\u2014just because the disease is so\nrare.\nSuppose Patrick figures all this out, and he is somewhat\nrelieved, but he still knows that he has a greater chance of\nhaving the disease than before. He would like to know with\ngreater certainty whether he actually does have the disease.\nWhat should he do? He should be tested again. Remember,\nthe number of people (out of a million) who had the disease\nand tested positive was 900, and the number who did not\nhave the disease and tested positive was 49,950. Let\u2019s imagine 250 | BAYESIANISM\nthis whole group taking the test again. Again, we are assuming\nno one is showing any symptoms, and we have only the test\nresults to worry about. Out of the 900 people with the disease,\n810 will test positive again (for the test correctly catches the\ndisease 90% of the time). Out of the 49,950 who tested positive\nwithout the disease, only about 2,500 will test positive again\n(for the test gives false positives only 5% of the time). So, now\nwe will have a smaller group of 3,310 who have tested positive\na second time. If Patrick gets a second positive result, then he\nis either among the diseased 810 out of 3,310, or he is among\nthe undiseased 2,500 out of 3,310. There is a 24% chance of\nbeing in the first group (diseased), and 76% chance of being in\nthe second (undiseased). This is more worrisome, as he now\nhas a 1 in 4 chance of having the disease. If he tests positive a\nthird time\u2014and you can do the calculation on your own!\u2014his\nchance of having the disease is 95%.\nBy the way, if the disease were far less rare\u2014affecting 1 in\n100 people, for example\u2014and all of our other numbers stayed\nthe same, getting a positive result on the first test should tell\nPatrick that he has a 15% of actually having the disease; a\nsecond positive result should tell him that his chance of having\nthe disease is 89%. BAYESIANISM | 251\nThe moral of this story is that you should always get a\nsecond opinion. It also shows that the new information we\nreceive has to be positioned correctly relative to our broader\nknowledge of the world. When a new piece of information\ncomes your way, you need to remember what your previous\nexperience of the world is and let that previous experience\nguide how much importance you attach to the new piece of\ninformation.\n2. Another example\nLet\u2019s turn to another sort of case to see Bayesianism in action.\nSuppose you read that there has been a UFO sighting.\nSomeone driving on a deserted highway at night reports they\nsaw a glowing disk descend from the sky, hover over the\nground for a minute, and then shoot back up into the sky.\nWhat should you believe? In particular, should you believe\nthat this sighting is compelling evidence for the claim that\nEarth has been visited by intelligent extraterrestrials?\nWe should begin by considering what our previous experience\nsays about the likelihood of alien visitors. From what we know,\nthe universe is a very big place, and spaceships can only travel\nso fast (less than the speed of light), which means that it takes\na very, very, very long time to travel from planet to planet\nor from solar system to solar system. There probably are 252 | BAYESIANISM\nintelligent beings elsewhere in the universe just given how big\nit is, but the likelihood that they are anywhere near us is very,\nvery low. So, our previous experience suggests that the\nlikelihood of alien visitors is extremely low, perhaps on the\norder of one in a billion or one in a trillion or even less.\nNow, let us consider the new information, the UFO report. We\nneed to weigh the extremely low probability of alien visitors\nagainst the likelihood that this report is true. It is an\nextraordinary report; people do not often report similar\nexperiences. What sort of probability should we attach to it?\nLet\u2019s consider it. On the one hand, people do very often offer\ntrue reports of what they experience. That\u2019s normal. But on\nthe other hand, sometimes people lie about extraordinary\nexperiences. Sometimes they seem to have extraordinary\nexperiences, but the experience is due to psychological stress\nor mishap. Sometimes such experiences might be caused by\nstrange weather phenomena, rare distortions of light, or\nanything other than alien visitors. There are many alternative\nexplanations.\nWe have to combine all of these possibilities into an overall\nestimate of how likely we think it is that the person actually\nsaw an alien spaceship. If we guess that all of these possible BAYESIANISM | 253\nexplanations for their experience\u2014really seeing a ship, lying,\npsychological stress, weather\u2014are all equally likely (which is a\ngenerous guess!), we might think the chance of the experience\nreally being a sighting of an alien spaceship is about 1 in 4.\nPut another way, by our estimate, it is three times more likely\nthat someone wrongly believes they have seen an alien spaceship\nthan that they have truly seen one.\nNow we put that 1 in 4 chance in the broader context of\nthe overall extremely low probability of alien visitors. (Note\nthat this case is similar to the case of Patrick and the very\nrare disease.) The chances that aliens have visited earth, and\nthat this person actually saw them, is extremely low (one in\na billion, say), mainly because the likelihood of alien visitors,\ngiven what we know about the vast distances of space, is\nextremely low, and the likelihood that the person falsely\nbelieves themselves to see an alien spaceship is so much greater.\nSo, in all, the report of a UFO should not cause you to\nsignificantly change your belief about alien visitors. It\nis far more likely that the report is coming from some other\ncause.\nBut what if lots of people report such experiences? This might\nchange our belief, depending on the details. If by \u201clots\u201d we 254 | BAYESIANISM\nmean thousands of reports coming from individuals driving\nat night on lonely highways, our beliefs should not change all\nthat much. It is still far more likely that their experiences are\ncoming from something other than actual alien visitors. But\nsuppose by \u201clots\u201d we mean millions of reports from people\ndriving on highways and in crowded sporting events and\npublic assemblies, plus observations of alien spaceships on\nradar and from orbiting satellites and from professional\nastronomers and even a video recording from the International\nSpace Station of aliens cruising by and waving from their\nspaceship window. (It is going to take a lot if we are to\novercome the initial extremely low probability of alien\nvisitors.) If these are the reports we are considering, we are\nin a case like Hume\u2019s eight days of darkness. The likelihood\nof so many reports coming from some cause other than alien\nspaceships becomes extremely low, and we should regard the\npossibility of alien visitors as far more likely.\nAgain, the general rule David Hume offered can provide a\nquick assessment. Which would be the greater \u201cmiracle\u201d? Is it\nmore of a miracle for the reports to be explained by some other\ncause or for the reported events to have actually happened as\ndescribed? 45.\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER\n1. Hume finds it far more likely that there was some sort of\nconspiracy in his Queen Elizabeth case than that she was\nresurrected from the dead. But doesn\u2019t this just show\nthat he is not being open-minded? Shouldn\u2019t an\nepistemic agent be impartial?\n2. Suppose that in our UFO example, someone regards the\ninitial probability of intelligent life forms visiting Earth\nas being pretty high\u2014because there are so many credible\nreports of UFOs! What might a good Bayesian say to\nthem?\n3. Bayesianism suggests that one should not believe that\nextremely improbable events happen. But extremely\nimprobable events do happen from time to time. Isn\u2019t\nthis enough to show that Bayesianism gives bad advice? 46.\nFURTHER READING\nAs mentioned, Bayes\u2019 Theorem is usually presented as a\nformula. The basic question is, \u201cWhat is the probability of\n{some event} given this evidence?\u201d The idea is to make the\nprobability proportional to both the probability of the event\non its own and the probability that the evidence would exist\nif the event happened and to make the probability inversely\nproportional to the probability of the evidence existing, even if\nthe event didn\u2019t happen. So, we have this:\nOr, letting A = the event, B = the evidence, and \u201cP(A|B)\u201d\nmeaning \u201cthe probability of A given B\u201d, we have: FURTHER READING | 257\nThere are many excellent videos about Bayes\u2019 Theorem on\nYouTube.

EPISTEMOLOGY\nAND THE\nINTERNET\nNobody can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for\nyourself.\n\u2014 Morpheus, in The Matrix (1999)\nMuch of epistemology, like much of philosophy, focuses on\nwhat stays the same in human experience regardless of\ntechnological progress: we know the truths about ordinary\nthings, like how many people are in our family, or whether it\nis raining, or whether we are hungry. The truths about such\nordinary things hold as well for 21st-century astronauts as for\nneolithic people. But this does not mean that technology\ncannot offer new kinds of philosophical questions and provide\nnew possible philosophical answers. The wise philosopher is\nthe one who can reliably discern what stays the same and when\na difference really makes a difference. 260 | 11. EPISTEMOLOGY AND THE INTERNET\nThe advent of the internet in the late 20th century is a\ndifference that makes a difference. It has changed economic\nand political landscapes, and it has deeply transformed our\nsense of art, culture, and communication. Most of the world\u2019s\npopulation now takes for granted that they are able to locate\nthemselves quite precisely on the globe and come into near-\ninstantaneous communication with nearly anyone else on it,\nand they also can access virtually the entirety of human\nknowledge and human history through a device they carry in\na pocket. Perhaps it is as true as ever that truth is truth and\nknowledge requires justification, but what is believed, what\nis known, how it comes to be known have changed about as\ndramatically as can be imagined.\nBut along with this profound transformation in knowledge,\nthere is a rising tide of false knowledge, or claims that seem to\nbe knowledge but, in fact, are not. Paradoxically, this has made\nknowledge both easier and harder to get, since we have such\neasy access to a great domain of knowledge that is thoroughly\nentangled with lies, deceptions, distortions, and\nmisinformation. To be responsible knowers, we need to\ndevelop new skills, new questions, and new sensibilities, for\nwe are living now in a world quite different from the world in\nwhich we evolved. 11. EPISTEMOLOGY AND THE INTERNET | 261\nWe will begin by trying to put the epistemological changes\nbrought on by the internet into a historical perspective. Then,\nwe will turn to the crucial topic of algorithms and the role\nthey play in our interactions with the internet. We will then\nconclude with some observations of the challenges forced by\ninternet epistemology.  47.\nINFORMATION IN\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\nHumans have existed in their modern form for around\n200,000 years, but only for the last 5,500 years have humans\nbeen writing anything down. So, for 97% of our history, our\nknowledge has been limited by our memory. People can\nremember a lot\u2014particularly when memory is routinely\ndeveloped and exercised and when lives depend on it\u2014but\neven so, the capacity of human memory is sharply limited.\nEven less information can be reliably passed along from\ngeneration to generation when memory is the only storage\nresource since there are only so many stories that can be\ninvented and passed along. This means that for most of our\nhistory there have been sharp limits on preserving old\ninformation and making use of it in new contexts. Not that\nthere was no preservation of information, of course; traditions,\nepic stories, folk wisdom, religious lore, cultural practices, and\nethical mores all are ways in which knowledge from the past\ncan be carried into the future without writing anything down.\nBut when these are all there is, the survival of any item of\nknowledge is very precarious. Evidently, human memory, 264 | INFORMATION IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT\ntogether with these cultural practices, have provided enough\nfor us to \u201cget by,\u201d but they have provided scarcely more than\nthat.\nSo, for the great majority of our species\u2019 existence, nature\nitself has served as a limit on the flow of information.\nBrains can only remember so much; only a portion of that\nmemory is encoded in songs and stories and passed along to\nnew generations; only a portion of those songs and stories\ncontinue to be retold over subsequent generations. There may\nhave been individuals who attempted to suppress stories or\ndistort them, but their attempts at controlling information\nare negligible when compared to the inherent limitations of\nnature.\nThe development of writing (c. 3500 BCE) punched a hole\nthrough these natural limits, as information could then be\nstored in something more durable than a human brian. Still,\nvery few humans learned to write and read, which meant that\nthere still remained a tight control over what information was\npreserved and exactly how it was preserved\u2014in other words,\nwhich stories were written down and how they were written.\nPraises for kings, the details of economic transactions, and\nreligious myths seem to have been common subjects for the INFORMATION IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT | 265\nearliest encoders of information (or scribes). Nevertheless,\nwriting itself allowed for more information to be passed and\nstored from generation to generation, which assisted in the\ngrowth of more complex societies. This increase in stored\ninformation coincided with more extensive trade networks\nand more cultural commerce among civilizations, generating\neven more information, of which more and more came to\nbe written down through the works of humanists and\nphilosophers. A notable result was that the amount of\ninformation accessible by humans came to be greater than the\namount of information actively known by humans. Literate\nsocieties \u201cknew\u201d more than their populations did because\ninformation was stored in libraries of unread books.\nNearly 50 centuries later, the invention of the printing press\n(c. 1450) tremendously amplified the production and\ndissemination of information, and the flow of information\nbecame a flood. More and more people had access to more\ninformation as literacy rates increased. While political states\nand religious authorities still exerted some control over what\nwas published, these controls were overcome by an ever\nincreasing popular demand for information which was\nseemingly without limit. More people read, owned, stored, and\neven wrote books on ever greater varieties of topics\u2014some\nfiction, some nonfiction, some ludicrous or scandalous, and a\ngreat many falling into all of these categories at once. It quickly 266 | INFORMATION IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT\nbecame impossible for anyone to control information or to\ncontrol disinformation or falsehoods posing as information.\nThe development of information technologies throughout the\n20th century, culminating in the creation of the internet,\nrepresents a jump in the history of human information\nprocessing capacities that is greater in scope to the\ndevelopment of writing and the invention of the printing\npress. No other innovation has given more people easier and\nfaster access to more information. There is very little that is\nknown that cannot be shared instantly with anyone with a\nconnection to the internet. The greatest repositories of\ninformation in the history of the world are literally at our\nfingertips.\nBut the creation of the internet has led to more problems,\nor, at any rate, monstrous enhancements of older problems.\nThe chief problems have to do with searching, filtering, and\ncontrolling. For centuries there have been the problems of\ntracking down a particular text in one library or another; of\nsorting through irrelevant information to find what is relevant;\nand of limiting the spread of information that is considered\nfalse, misleading, or dangerous. In the past, these problems\nwere confronted through information management systems INFORMATION IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT | 267\n(such as the \u201ccall number\u201d system used in libraries) or through\nthe specialized training of scholars in schools and universities\nor through political or religious attempts at censorship. But\nthese traditional, human-based efforts at managing\ninformation are no match for the modern engines of\ninformation production. (Measurement on these matters is\ntricky, but by one estimate, the world produces 2.5 quintillion\nbytes of data each day. Whatever exactly that means, it is a\nlot!) There is simply no way that humans can manage all the\ninformation that is available. Hence the need for algorithms. 48.\nALGORITHMS\nAn algorithm is any sort of routine procedure. A cake recipe\nis an algorithm for making a cake: if you mix together the\ningredients, put them in a pan, put the pan in an oven, and\nwait for some time, at the end, you will have a cake. Some paper\nassignments given to students can be done algorithmically:\nstate a thesis, present some arguments, write up a conclusion,\nand turn it in. The virtue of an algorithm is that it breaks a\nlarger project into a set of smaller steps which, when done in\nthe right order, complete the project. It does not matter who\nperforms the smaller steps so long as they are done correctly.\nIn some cases, the steps are small enough and simple enough\nfor a mindless machine to do them. In that case, when a simple\nmachine can perform an algorithm, we call the algorithm a\nprogram. One might think of the laborious \u201crecipe\u201d we\nfollow when we perform long division. That algorithm, or\none like it, can be performed by a mindless calculator, thank\ngoodness.\nWith the advent of computers in the 20th century, more and ALGORITHMS | 269\nmore of our information has been coded into data that\ncomputers can process and manage, which means that more\nand more of the information at our disposal is processed by\nalgorithms. As I type these words, an algorithm is taking the\nelectrical signals from the keys I press and storing them as\nnumbers; other algorithms are turning those numbers into\ncommands to light up a few pixels on my screen so that I\ncan see what I write. And of course, matters get increasingly\ncomplicated from this point forward as I send a file to you\nthrough the air and over some wires and your machine receives\nthe signals and you pull up the document and read it. The\nalgorithms in ordinary laptop computers are like complicated\nfactories of routines, all performing their narrow operations so\nas to produce overall effects that we take for granted\u2014until,\nthat is, something goes wrong and a file won\u2019t load and we\ncurse the machines for being so stupid!\nWhen we turn to the internet to search for the things we are\ninterested in, armies of algorithms take in the information we\ngive them and search for other collections of stored\ninformation that \u201cmatch\u201d what we are looking for (at least\naccording to the programming of the algorithms). The\nalgorithms, of course, do not know what they are doing; they\nare mindlessly following recipes which (if all goes right) end\nup with results that satisfy us. Since we cannot count on the\nalgorithms to have any common sense or to know what they 270 | ALGORITHMS\nare doing, the programmers of the algorithms have to rely on\ncertain tricks that will get the algorithms to do what we want.\nSearch algorithms will look for the websites that most people\nhave ended up going to when they typed words similar to what\nwe typed; they will rank websites according to how popular\nthey are by some measure or other; they may even take a peek\nat your own history to try to gauge which sites are more likely\nto satisfy your interests. It is far from foolproof, of course. If\nyou are interested in the historical and cultural background\nof cockfighting, be careful what search terms you employ or\nyou may be presented with images not strictly relevant to your\ninquiry.\nExactly how search engines do what they do is a closely\nguarded secret because search engines are very big business\nindeed. They are big business because the companies that\nprovide search engines use them as opportunities to provide\nyou with information you did not exactly ask for. This is\nadvertising. If you are interested in baking cakes, you might\nalso be interested in buying special baking pans, a stylish\napron, or a new mixer, and advertisements for such products\nmight appear somewhere on your screen. Companies hoping\nto sell these products pay search engine companies to put those\nads on the screens of people who are likely to be interested in ALGORITHMS | 271\nthe products. The strategy is far more focused and far more\neffective than placing an ad in a newspaper.1\nBut the business model of search engine companies does not\nstop there. As you search for items, search engines also gather\ndata about your interests. These data are compiled together\nwith data from all other users so that high-level algorithms\ncan discern larger patterns of human interests and behavior.\nIt may turn out, for example, that people interested in recipes\nfor carrot cake are also more likely to be interested in folksy\naprons, and also more likely to be interested in magazines\ncelebrating rural lifestyles. Perhaps they also tend to vote\nRepublican and have pro-life views. Perhaps they also are more\nlikely to buy domestic automobiles and air fryers. I am making\nup these correlations for the point of illustration, but search\nengines are actively gathering data to make far more secure\nassessments as to what sorts of people like what sorts of things.\nThese metadata\u2014or data about the data reflecting people\u2019s\nonline activities\u2014are the real source of wealth for search\nengine companies. The aim is to know people better than they\nknow themselves. Search engine companies do not exactly sell\n1. Newspaper: a 20th-century artifact made of paper on which was printed news,\nadvertisements, and comics, and delivered to people\u2019s doorsteps; you can find\nimages of such ancient relics on the internet. 272 | ALGORITHMS\nthis information outright, but it plays a central role in a\ncomplex, multi-level process in which advertising space is\nauctioned off to companies in an automated process known as\nreal-time bidding. Basically, real-time bidding is an algorithm\nthat sells access to user\u2019s information to other algorithms so\nthat client companies can mount more effective ad campaigns.\nIt probably seems to you that this sort of information may\nbe valuable, but it cannot be the most valuable thing in the\nworld. But you are wrong. In 2017, The Economist announced\nthat information had surpassed oil as the world\u2019s most valuable\nresource. There is more money to be made in gathering\ninformation about people\u2019s buying habits than there is in\nselling them any particular thing.\nAlgorithms are like vast ant colonies. An individual is fairly\nsimple and robotic in its behavior. But when assembled into\ngreat colonies, those simple robots can manage to accomplish\nextraordinarily complicated tasks. Indeed, they can accomplish\nany task that can be broken down into simple steps. It\npractically does not matter how many simple steps need to\nbe performed since we have limitless supplies of \u201cants\u201d to put\nto work. The production, storing, searching, filtering, and\ncontrol of information in the modern world\u2014and even the ALGORITHMS | 273\nbuying and selling of it\u2014is done primarily by algorithms; the\nrole of humans now is to be sources of information and to\nconsume in an economy based upon it.\nThere are two broad lessons to be gathered from this\ndiscussion of algorithms. The first lesson is that algorithms\nare mechanical and mindless in the sense that they do not\nknow what they are doing and proceed according to rules in\nrobotic fashion. This means they can make \u201cmistakes\u201d (from\nthe point of view of our own expectations) without realizing\nit or without anything going wrong in their programming. As\nwe will see, this also means that algorithms can be \u201cgamed\u201d\nor manipulated in clever ways so as to produce disinformation\nto users. The second lesson is that there is a lot of power and\nwealth connected to algorithms and tremendous incentives to\nfind ways to gain control over them. Were Francis Bacon alive\ntoday, he would say that \u201cAlgorithms themselves are power.\u201d\n\u2026 49.\nKNOWING THROUGH\nTHE INTERNET\nIn many ways, for many purposes, the internet provides the\nmost accurate resources of information ever available to\nhuman beings. A case in point is Wikipedia. Let us first admit\nthat many valid criticisms can be made of Wikipedia. On\nunpopular or relatively obscure topics, Wikipedia merely\nreproduces seriously dated publications that are in the public\ndomain. On some topics, the presentation is shaped by\namateurs with uninformed and peculiar points of view. Topics\ncan be hijacked by political operatives. Information from more\nauthoritative sources is not always accorded greater value.\nThere is no systematic practice of fact-checking. Many of the\nentries read as if they were composed by disorganized\ncommittees of volunteers (which they are). And more\ncriticisms can also be made; a long list of them, in fact, can\nbe found in the Wikipedia entry entitled \u201cCriticisms of\nWikipedia.\u201d KNOWING THROUGH THE INTERNET | 275\nBut despite these criticisms, and despite persistent injunctions\nof college professors against using Wikipedia as a source, it\nis without a doubt the greatest single source of knowledge ever\nassembled. The more responsible epistemic agent will always\nbalance whatever is said on Wikipedia with a broader survey of\nother more authoritative sources, but for a quick and mostly\naccurate overview of the widest array of possible topics, no\nother encyclopedia even comes close. Even if Wikipedia is a\nsecond-rate (and sometimes third-rate) resource on each\nparticular topic, there is no other base of knowledge that can\ncome close to its range of coverage and general level of\naccuracy.\nAnd, of course, Wikipedia is not the only available source of\nknowledge on the internet. The internet gives us access to first-\nrate scholarly journals, news media, blogs by true experts of\nobscure matters, maps, lectures, and so on without limit. The\ninternet makes it easier than ever before to take a broad\nsampling of different accounts of nearly any topic, and to form\njudicious opinions based upon that diversity of resources.\nBut this is only, at best, half of the story. As recognized at the\nend of the previous section, internet searches can be \u201cgamed,\u201d\nand there are powerful incentives for distorting what users find 276 | KNOWING THROUGH THE INTERNET\nas a result of their searches. This is shown most dramatically in\ninstances of exploiting data voids.\nAs expansive and comprehensive as the internet is, there are\ntopics that have a very minimal presence on the web. It may\nbe a set of words that is not commonly used, or it may be a\nperson or event or little town about which people have very\nlittle to say. We can call such a neglected entity a \u201cdata void,\u201d\nwhich simply means that there is not much information on\nthat particular topic on the internet. If, for whatever reason,\nsomeone wishes to tell some particular story about these data\nvoid entities, they can tell that story in multiple places\nthroughout the web, and mindless algorithms will direct users\nto that story if they happen to search for that entity. A data\nvoid is thus an opportunity to establish and control a narrative.\nFor example, the term \u201ccrisis actor\u201d was for some time a data\nvoid. No one searched for that pair of words. But, according to\nrecent media and internet researchers, at some point malicious\nindividuals seized the term and populated the internet with\nmany false stories about people who were hired to pretend\nto be victims of mass shootings. Multiple websites offered\nseemingly genuine accounts by \u201ccrisis actors\u201d who admitted\nto having portrayed victims of various faked or staged mass KNOWING THROUGH THE INTERNET | 277\nshootings. Efforts were then made by the malicious individuals\nto get the phrase \u201ccrisis actor\u201d mentioned on some national\nmedia outlet. The efforts succeeded, and when viewers of the\nmedia went to search the term \u201ccrisis actor\u201d they found\nmultiple accounts from different sources of people admitting\nto playing roles in staging fake shootings. This gave support\nto baseless conspiracy theories about the government staging\nmass shootings. Similar data void hijackings have been\nexecuted with the terms \u201ccollusion hoax,\u201d \u201cblack on white\ncrime,\u201d and \u201cpizzagate.\u201d\nThis is an example of malicious agents exploiting the mindless\noperations of algorithms to bring baseless conspiracy theories\nto a broad audience\u2019s attention. But there are also less\noutrageous attempts at doing the same thing. Political\norganizations can promote specific terms and slogans and\nmake sure that they direct the public narrative by establishing\nwebsites that become the go-to sites for searches employing\nthose terms: this is called strategic keyword signalling. These\nare efforts to \u201cgame\u201d the mindless functioning of algorithms so\nas to exert influence over what broad communities take to be\ntruth.\nOf course, as a student in epistemology that has thought 278 | KNOWING THROUGH THE INTERNET\nthrough skepticism and the Grand Deception Doubt, you will\nnaturally wonder whether \u201cstrategic keyword signalling\u201d is\nitself an exploitation of a data void. Perhaps the experts in\nmedia studies are doing exactly what they are accusing the\npeople behind \u201ccrisis actors\u201d as doing! And a terribly\ndestructive seed of skepticism is thereby planted. We may begin\nto suspect that we can no longer trust anything we find on\nthe web. \u201cAnyone can \u2018prove\u2019 anything by posting false\ninformation and manipulating the internet\u2019s algorithms,\u201d\nsomeone might think. \u201cWe cannot ever know anything, and\nso we might as well choose to believe whatever story we like\nbest.\u201d These extreme doubts will only be nourished by our\nobservation of how much power and wealth there is in the\ncontrol of algorithms. There are strong incentives to control\nthe knowledge of individuals, and the private companies\nhosting search engines have unparalleled power and incentives\nto exert that control. With so much at stake, how can\ninformation not be thoroughly biased and skewed toward the\ninterests of those in power?\nBut as students of epistemology, we also know how to begin\nto think our way through these extreme doubts. If we adopt\na basic Humean or Bayesian outlook on the information we\nare coming across, we shall start to assess the occasions where\nwe have solid reasons for doubt and those where the reasons\nare less solid. The claim that public shootings are entirely KNOWING THROUGH THE INTERNET | 279\nfabricated as the result of massive government conspiracies is\nan extraordinary claim and should require extraordinary\nevidence\u2014far more extraordinary than a small collection of\nobscure websites. The claim that everything on the web is\nfabricated is even more extraordinary, and finding evidence\nfor such a claim through conspiracy-theory websites leans\ndecidedly in the direction of being a self-refuting justification.\nThe more plausible claim is that there is genuine information\nand disinformation on the web, and patient inquiry and\nreasoning is required to sort the more likely from the less likely\nor the reliable from the unreliable\u2014as has always been the case\nin human knowledge. 50.\nSOME ADVICE\nPerhaps the most important advice one can give regarding the\nproblem of what one should trust when trying to gain\nknowledge through the internet comes from a school of\nphilosophy known as hermeneutics. Hermeneutics is the\nstudy of interpretation. Particularly, it is the study of how\nto interpret texts whether those texts are books or websites.\nAuthors have always been tricky and strategic in providing\ninformation. Sometimes they are trying to advance one special\ncause, and sometimes they are trying to appear as advancing\none cause while really\u2014\u201cbetween the lines\u201d\u2014advancing some\nother cause. Readers have to be very critical and self-reflective\nwhen they read if they are to grasp what is really being said in a\ntext.\nThe French philosopher of hermeneutics, Paul Ric\u0153ur\n(1913-2005), advocated a hermeneutics of suspicion\nespecially when reading the tricky texts of Marx, Nietzsche,\nand Freud. These authors were very conscious of the effects\nwords can have and often, Ric\u0153ur argued, seemed to say one SOME ADVICE | 281\nthing while really meaning something else. They deliberately\nset out puzzles and paradoxes in order to prompt readers to\nthink for themselves and reach some further conclusion that\nwas not stated explicitly in the texts themselves. But setting\naside the challenges of reading such difficult philosophical\nauthors, for our purposes we might consider adopting a\nhermeneutics of suspicion toward our readings of online texts.\nIn adopting a hermeneutics of suspicion, we must first\nrecognize that in any exchange of information, the provider of\nthe information is attempting to cause the receiver to adopt\nsome belief. If we are suspicious, we will begin to ask who is\ngetting us to believe what and for what purpose:\nWho? Who is providing this information? Are they\nin a position to have this information? Are they relying\non other sources? How reliable are those sources?\nWhat? What is this provider trying to get me to\nbelieve? Is that claim, given my prior experience, likely\nto be true? What sort of initial probability would I put\non that claim, before reading the account of this\nprovider, and to what extent should this new\ninformation change that probability?\nFor what purpose? Why would this provider want\nme to gain this belief? Is it this provider\u2019s \u201cjob\u201d to 282 | SOME ADVICE\nsimply communicate truths \u2014 or are they working for\nsome other cause?\nThe hermeneutics of suspicion asks us to adopt the sort of\nattitude toward information that one might adopt in buying a\nused car from a stranger. We will want to gauge the character\nof this stranger, what they are selling us, and for what purpose.\nVery often, of course, a stranger is selling us a used car that has\nno hidden flaws, merely because they no longer need the car\nand they would like a fair amount of money for it. That\u2019s a\ngood and very common scenario. Similarly, in many instances,\nthe providers of information on the internet are simply trying\nto provide accurate information based on reliable sources so\nthat readers gain accurate information. Reputable news media\non the internet\u2014the Associated Press (AP), for example\u2014are\ndedicated to providing accurate news information. That is\ntheir brand, and they command a large population of readers\nprecisely because they are seen over time to be reliable\nproviders of information. Their \u201cbusiness model\u201d is based on\nproviding accurate and reliable information. It would be very\nhard to find one set of claims that the AP is trying to get its\nreaders to believe, since stories are provided on a wealth of\ntopics from a variety of angles, and there is not a single theme\nthat runs through them all. SOME ADVICE | 283\nBut other cases are far less straightforward. Some providers of\ninformation on the internet clearly provide only information\nthat is meant to encourage a narrow range of beliefs in readers,\nand it is relatively easy to identify what those beliefs are. The\nsources that are relied upon are only sources that are interested\nin promoting those beliefs, and there is little or no discussion\nof other sources or support for other beliefs. These sites are like\nsellers of used cars who only point out the positive features of\nthe car in question and refuse to answer any questions about\nrecent repairs, mileage, oil changes, etc.\nAs in every case of trying to determine what sources to trust,\nwe are always working from some initial information we have\nabout the world and assessing new information on the basis\nof our existing information. Someone who is antecedently\nconvinced that big news media like the AP are only offering\nstories to justify those in power, and, for example, are refusing\nto report widespread alien landings and the efforts of those\naliens to take control over national governments, will provide\na very different assessment of the reliability of those media.\nOr, somewhat more plausibly, if someone holds that big news\nmedia are thoroughly embedded in capitalistic economic\nstructures, and they refuse to highlight the evils and injustices\nof those structures, they also will give less credence to the 284 | SOME ADVICE\nreports of those media. We must always begin with the\nworldview we have, make our assessments from that starting\nplace, and be willing to change our minds as new evidence is\npresented and as that evidence warrants changing our beliefs.\n(This is the lesson of Bayesianism.) A hermeneutics of\nsuspicion should always be running in the background as we\ntake on the endeavor of trying to gain knowledge through the\ninternet.\nFor what it is worth, we may consider the judgments of media\nexperts who take on the task of sorting through various news\noutlets and making assessments as to their accuracy and\nreliability. Ad Fontes Media, for example, is a crowd-funded\norganization that uses a team of about 20 analysts with varying\npolitical perspectives to rate the accuracy and objectivity of\nhundreds of stories from dozens of major news outlets. In the\nend, they provide a chart displaying their findings. Here, for\nexample, is the chart as of January 2021: SOME ADVICE | 285\nOf course, this chart will only be authoritative to someone\nwho antecedently agrees that Ad Fontes Media and the\nanalysts they use are in positions to make assessments of\nobjectivity and accuracy. But we might see what results if we\nconfront Ad Fontes Media with our suspicious questions. (In\nwhat follows, I will provide answers as made available on\nWikipedia since by this point it should be clear to everyone\nthat I have drunk the Wikipedia Kool-Aid!)\nWho? \u201cAd Fontes Media, Inc. is a Colorado-based\nmedia watchdog organization primarily known for its\nMedia Bias Chart which rates media sources in terms\nof political bias and reliability. The organization was 286 | SOME ADVICE\nfounded in 2014 by patent attorney Vanessa Otero with\nthe goal of combating political polarization. Ad Fontes\nMedia uses a panel of analysts across the political\nspectrum to evaluate articles for the Chart.\u201d\nWhat? The Ad Fontes media chart is meant to show\nthat some news sources are more reliable than others\nand some more biased than others. For the 2020 chart,\nfor example, \u201cnearly 1800 individual articles and TV\nnews shows were rated by at least three analysts with\ndifferent political views (left, right and center). There\nwere 20 analysts, [and] each reviewed about 370 articles\nand about 17 TV shows.\u201d\nFor what purpose? \u201cOtero [the founder] sees the\nMedia Bias Chart as an \u2018anchor\u2019 that counteracts\npolitical polarization in news media and aspires for Ad\nFontes to become a \u2018Consumer Reports for media\nratings\u2019. She compared low-quality news sources to junk\nfood and described sources with extreme bias as \u2018very\ntoxic and damaging to the country\u2019.\u201d\nBoth Wikipedia and Ad Fontes Media are about as crowd-\nsourced as information sources can be. This suggests that, in\nthe judgment of a very broad consensus, the chart represents\nan honest effort to communicate information about media\nbias for the sake of having smarter consumers of information.\nAnyone with serious doubts as to their impartiality should be\nexpected to justify those doubts using all that we have learned SOME ADVICE | 287\nabout Humean and Bayesian probability with a robust but\nsensible hermeneutics of suspicion.\nMedia Attributions\n\u2022 Figure 11.1 \u00a9 Ad Fontes Media is licensed under a All\nRights Reserved license 51.\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER\n1. Where do you get your news, and how do you sort out\nreliable from unreliable news sources? Can you\nformulate good rules to follow?\n2. Some have argued that social media platforms (such as\nTwitter or Facebook) should be held responsible for the\nmaterial they allow to be published and shared on their\nsites. What do you see as the advantages and\ndisadvantages of such a policy?\n3. Some have argued that the flood of information we\nexperience has made our understanding shallower or less\ncomplete. \u201cWe have more facts, but less understanding.\u201d\nCan you explain why this might be so? Would we know\nmore if we had less information? 52.\nFURTHER READING\nMichael Golebiewski and Danah Boyd, \u201cData Voids: Where\nMissing Data Can be Easily Exploited,\u201d Data & Society,\nreport, October 29 2019. https://datasociety.net/library/data-\nvoids/\nO\u2019Connor, C & Weatherall, J.O.

CONSPIRACY\nTHEORIES\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re paranoid\ndoesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t after you.\u201d\n\u2014 Joseph Heller, Catch-22\nAt some level, people who believe in conspiracy theories are\nbeing paradigmatically rational. They are seeking out evidence\nfor a claim, they are providing explanations grounded in\nreports and observations, and they construct a theory that is\nconsistent and makes sense of the relevant data. And\nsometimes, of course, there really are conspiracies in which\nthe conspirators successfully (for a time) manage to hide what\nthey are doing or what they have done (Watergate is one such\nexample). But the term \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d is normally used\nto refer to theories that are extremely implausible and even\nirrational. So, what has gone wrong? How does it happen that\npeople with such praiseworthy epistemological virtues end up\npromoting implausible, irrational theories? 292 | 12. CONSPIRACY THEORIES\nAs we will see, a conspiracy theory emerges when someone\naccepts a claim as incontrovertibly true and then employs their\nrational abilities to reinterpret what they read or see so as to\nsupport that claim. So, there is a great degree of rationality\nemployed in any conspiracy theory; it\u2019s just that it is in the\nservice of an implausible end. 53.\nTHE \"SEED BELIEF\"\nMODEL\nAs we will see, there can be many ways that a conspiracy theory\ncomes to be, and people may have many different sorts of\nmotivations in coming to believe them. There may not be\na single general theory of conspiracy theories that captures\nthe essential nature of them all. Indeed, there is good reason\nto think there is no set of features that all \u201cbad\u201d conspiracy\ntheories have in common since some conspiracy theories turn\nout to be true. But we will consider one \u201crational\nreconstruction\u201d of conspiracy theories that seems to be true for\na great many of them.\nWe might see a conspiracy theory as beginning with a \u201cseed\nbelief,\u201d or one that gets the theory planted. The seed belief\nmay be that it is simply too difficult to send humans to the\nmoon; that it is worrisome to put a chemical like fluoride into\ndrinking water; that Elvis Presley is too important to have died\nfrom drug abuse; that a small group of terrorists could not\nhave organized the terrible events of 9/11; that the Earth\nsimply could not be spherical; that Barack Obama must be\nfrom Africa; that the vapor trails left by jet airplanes must 294 | THE &QUOT;SEED BELIEF&QUOT; MODEL\nbe dangerous; and so on. Each seed belief may seem to have\na degree of plausibility, given some basic beliefs and without\nlooking any further into the matter. A person may have some\nseparate motivation for wanting the seed belief to be true (Elvis\nmay have meant a lot to them, for example, or they may wish\nto have some reason for rejecting the legitimacy of an African-\nAmerican president). For now, we will set aside the question of\nexactly why the seed belief gets planted; let\u2019s assume that, for\nsome reason, it does.\nThe seed belief quickly sets down some strong roots by making\nuse of the human tendency toward confirmation bias (as\ndiscussed in Chapter 8). Humans very naturally seek out\nevidence for beliefs they have, and it takes additional effort for\nany human to seek out evidence that goes against their beliefs.\nAnd it is relatively easy to find confirming evidence for many\nbeliefs. Most information is either irrelevant to the seed belief\n(in which case it is at least consistent with the belief), or with a\nbit of further interpretation, the evidence can be interpreted in\nsuch a way as to be consistent with the belief. So, for example,\nthere are newspaper reports of Elvis\u2019s death. But stories in\nnewspapers can be faked, or reporters can be given false reports\nfrom the police or the coroner. There was a funeral for Elvis,\nbut funerals can be staged. Elvis isn\u2019t seen in public anymore,\nso he could be in hiding. And when it eventually happens that\nsome people report seeing someone who looked a bit like Elvis THE &QUOT;SEED BELIEF&QUOT; MODEL | 295\n(though he had lost weight and had grown a beard). Aha! The\nKing is alive and in disguise! Confirming evidence!\nOnce the seed belief has secured itself in the mind of the\nbeliever, the believer will have to face a very awkward question.\nThe question is why there are not more people who share the\nseed belief. The seed belief is supported by a lot of confirming\nevidence, after all, as the believer has discovered. The only\nexplanation (so it seems) is that other people are being actively\nmisled. They are constantly being fed some story that simply\nisn\u2019t true in an effort to keep the seed belief from spreading\nto more people. And so there must be a conspiracy that is\nmanipulating people into false belief. A group of conspirators\nwould do this only if they had something to hide, of course,\nwhich indicates that the conspiracy must be malicious. And\nbecause the conspiracy is so successful at keeping the seed\nbelief from spreading, it must be an extraordinarily widespread\nand intelligent conspiracy. There is hardly any evidence for its\nexistence, which may just show how crafty the leaders of the\nconspiracy are!\nBut the dedicated individual will be able to find evidence for\nthe conspiracy by looking for clues in the right places and\nby discovering the absence of information where the theorist 296 | THE &QUOT;SEED BELIEF&QUOT; MODEL\nbelieves there should be some. And through this process of\nfinding evidence first for the seed belief, and then for the\nconspiracy keeping others from sharing the seed belief, the\nseed belief itself becomes justified. The theorist has interpreted\nwhat they have seen, read, and heard in such a way as to\nsupport the seed belief, which is no longer just a belief that\nhappened to take root in someone\u2019s mind but is now\ndocumented with scores of newspaper articles, YouTube\ninterviews, and independently-published books by the small\ncircle of other people who share the seed belief. And now\ncomes the clincher: why would there be all of this evidence\nif the seed belief were simply false? Why would people take\nso much trouble to find evidence for something that didn\u2019t\nhappen? Why would this dedicated individual devote so much\nenergy and effort to documenting something that isn\u2019t real?\nThere is only one way to explain all of the work people are\nputting into justifying their belief: the seed belief must be true.\nTwo further patterns of reasoning also help a seed belief to\ngrow strong roots: the conviction that a single explanation\nis better than a set of independent explanations, and the\nconviction that when someone benefits from an event, they\nmust be causally responsible for it. 54.\nMONOCASUAL\nEXPLANATION, AND CUI\nBONO INFERENCES\nHumans tend to understand events through stories, and\nstories are easiest to follow when there is a single line of causes.\nIt is easy to follow a story of the form \u201cA caused B, which\ncaused C, which caused D.\u201d It is much harder to follow a story\nof the form \u201cA caused B, and meanwhile C caused D, and\nD kept E from happening, and when B happened without E\nalso happening, F was the result.\u201d For this reason, we are likely\nto favor stories with a single line of causes\u2014a \u201cmonocausal\nexplanation\u201d\u2014over a story that requires keeping track of\nseparate lines of causation. (We might see monocausal\nexplanations as one version of the available heuristic bias.)\nSometimes, of course, a monocausal explanation is perfectly in\norder, and there is no need to overcomplicate things. But very\noften we push for a monocausal explanation when the truth\nis more complicated. We can see this in many popular history 298 | MONOCASUAL EXPLANATION, AND CUI BONO INFERENCES\nbooks which push for a monocausal explanation of why \u201cthe\nWest\u201d conquered the rest of the world, rather than the other\nway around. World history over the centuries of course\nincludes many thousands of separate events, forces, pressures,\nand shifts, but recounting them all makes for an extremely\ncomplicated story. It is much nicer to be able to tell a single\ncomprehensive story.\nWe can see the human inclination toward monocausal\nexplanations at work in conspiracy theories. So, for example,\nif someone wanted to understand what is happening in our\neconomy, they would have to study the behavior of markets,\nthe supply of labor, effects of consumer demand, the roles\nof tariffs and regulations, and so on. It is safe to say there\nis not a single person who can master all of these separate\ncausal economic influences in detail, and anyone who tried\nto offer even a vague general picture would be telling a very\ncomplicated story with many separate lines of causality, a story\nthat would be very hard to follow. It is far more satisfying\nto simply believe in a secret group of people who control\neverything for their own economic interest, \u201ca ruling global\nelite.\u201d With such a simple theory we can explain every\neconomic development as being caused by a single entity. No\nneed to do all of that research! And when we see groups of\npowerful people assemble for meetings of organizations like\nthe World Trade Organization, our suspicions will be MONOCASUAL EXPLANATION, AND CUI BONO INFERENCES | 299\nconfirmed. They must be the ruling global elite. (Of course,\nthis is not to say that the WTO is not enormously influential,\nbut not even the WTO can control everything.)\nIn this example, a more plausible view is that our economy\nis an exceedingly complicated system with many agents and\nmany causes. It is true that rich people have more advantages\n(that is what \u201crich\u201d means), and certainly, they play pivotal\nroles in making big investments and enacting certain policies,\nand organizations like the WTO promote their interests. Poor\npeople do not have nearly as much power, and they usually\nsuffer as a result of those investments and policies. Many\nrightful criticisms can be made of many features of the overall\nsystem, and economists and public policy experts are busily\nraising these criticisms in mounds of articles and books. But\nnone of these truths imply that there is a single, organized\ngroup of people \u201cbehind it all.\u201d In fact, the very complexity\nof the overall system suggests that there could not possibly be\na single group \u201cbehind it all.\u201d How on earth could anyone\nmanage \u201cit all\u201d? Nevertheless, all of that being said, it surely\nis tempting to believe there must be a single group \u201cbehind\nit all.\u201d For then we have an easy story to tell, an easy story to\nunderstand, and someone to blame. 300 | MONOCASUAL EXPLANATION, AND CUI BONO\nINFERENCES\nConspiracy theories\u2014and especially conspiracy theories of\neconomics\u2014also often trade upon \u201ccui bono\u201d inferences.\n\u201cCui bono?\u201d is Latin for the question, \u201cWho benefits?\u201d Many\nevents, of course, are to the benefit of certain people or\ninstitutions or at least are seen as beneficial to them. If we\nare likely to believe in monocausal explanations, then when\nwe see some group benefit as the result of some action or\nchange, we might well infer that the action or change was\ncaused by that group. So, for example, spending on the military\nincreased as a result of the terrorist attacks on 9/11, and the\nspending brought considerable benefit to military contractors.\nSo, were military contractors behind 9/11? The state of Israel\nwas established as a result of the horrors perpetrated on Jewish\npeople by the Nazis in World War II and establishing a\nhomeland for the Jews was a great benefit for them. So, did\nthe Jews fake the Holocaust, in order to get a homeland? These\nare cui bono inferences, and they are more easily made when\nmonocausal explanations are also believed\u2014in other words,\nwhen there is a single group of people \u201cbehind it all\u201d who will\nbenefit from the events.\nWhile raising a cui bono question is often important and can\nhelp to sort out questions of motivations of certain actors in a\nsituation, the mere fact that someone benefits from a change\nnever itself implies that they intentionally brought about the\nchange. It might be true that, very often, humans act to benefit MONOCASUAL EXPLANATION, AND CUI BONO INFERENCES | 301\nthemselves, but it does not follow from this that whenever\nhumans benefit it is the result of their own strategic actions.\nSometimes events benefit a group, but that group is not\nresponsible for those events. And in the cases of 9/11 and the\nHolocaust, none of the people who benefitted by subsequent\nresults would say that the benefits were worth the cost. 55.\nWHERE SEED BELIEFS\nCOME FROM\nSo far, we have an account of conspiracy theories as growing\nfrom seed beliefs and being nourished by confirmation bias,\na bias toward monocausal explanations, and the temptation\nto make cui bono inferences. The biases and temptations are\nperhaps easily enough accounted for. Our evolutionary past\nhas not given us perfect reasoning capacities. But where do the\nseed beliefs come from? How does a person come to believe\nand then insist upon a belief that should be discarded after\neven a little bit of research?\nSometimes, a seed belief may result from some of our other\nweaknesses in reasoning such as anchoring or in-group bias.\nFor example, we first hear that vaccines cause diseases or that\nBarack Obama is African or that UFOs are commonly seen\nfrom friends and family members we trust. The credence we\ngive to those beliefs only has to be strong enough to get us\nto look for further evidence in support of the belief, or to WHERE SEED BELIEFS COME FROM | 303\ndefend them against others\u2019 objections, and then the other\nfeatures of our cognitive machinery will kick in to add more\nsupport for the belief making it stronger and stronger the more\nwe defend it. What began as a simple belief becomes a well-\ndefended theory and then an unshakeable conviction. In these\ncases, a conspiracy theory is seen as something like a parasite or\ninfection that lands upon a hapless believer, and the believer\u2019s\nown cognitive machinery is harnessed to give the invader more\nstrength and vitality. \u201cCuring\u201d the infection will be difficult\nas it will require somehow re-orienting the believer\u2019s entire\ncognitive system to cause them to recognize the invader as\nan invader and to begin to recover from the disease by re-\nexamining one\u2019s entire structure of beliefs.\nAn example of this sort of re-orientation can be found in the\ncase of Derek Black, the son of a grand wizard of the Ku Klux\nKlan, who was a young and rising star of white nationalism.\nBlack was raised in an environment encouraging the belief that\nthe races should be separate from one another and that the\nUnited States should be \u201ckept pure\u201d as a white nation. He\nbelieved that a vast government misinformation campaign was\nbehind popular attitudes in favor of desegregation,\nmulticulturalism, and antiracism. 304 | WHERE SEED BELIEFS COME FROM\nBlack went to college and encountered many people who\nwanted nothing to do with him or his beliefs. But a small\nJewish community at the college invited him to weekly dinners\nand patiently offered evidence against his views. In an\ninterview Black recalls the discussions:\nI would say, \u201cThis is what I believe about I.Q. differences.\nI have 12 different studies that have been published over\nthe years, here\u2019s the journal that\u2019s put this stuff together,\nI believe that this is true, that race predicts I.Q., and that\nthere were I.Q. differences in races.\u201d And they would come\nback with 150 more recent, more well researched studies\nand explain to me how statistics works, and we would go\nback and forth until I would come to the end of that\nargument, and I\u2019d say, \u201cYes that makes sense, that does not\nhold together, and I\u2019ll remove that from my ideological\ntoolbox, but everything else is still there.\u201d And we did that\nover a year or two on one thing after another until I got to\na point where I didn\u2019t believe it anymore (\u201cDerek Black\u201d,\nWikipedia entry).\nOver a year or two, Black became convinced that the entire\nframework of beliefs in which he had been raised was false. He\npublicly renounced his beliefs even though this came at the\ncost of alienating him from his family. WHERE SEED BELIEFS COME FROM | 305\nBlack\u2019s case is one in which his seed belief in white nationalism\nwas caused by his home environment, and his belief in a\nconspiracy theory grew from that seed belief. In other cases,\nhowever, a seed belief is chosen precisely because it is widely\nrejected by a culture that an individual rejects for one reason\nor another. In these cases, the more extreme the seed belief, the\nbetter because the individual wants to distinguish themselves\nfrom the wider culture judging the belief as \u201ccrazy.\u201d In these\ncases, adopting the seed belief is a conscious act of rebellion\nagainst prevailing norms, and the conspiracy theory that grows\nfrom the seed belief is meant as an indictment of the prevailing\nculture that so confidently denounces the seed belief.\nThe recent growth in Flat-Earthers may be an example of this.\nA Flat-Earther believes the Earth is a flat disk and that there is a\nconspiracy of scientists and others who brainwash people into\nthinking that the Earth is a globe. There were Flat-Earthers\nmany centuries ago, but the view seems to have resurfaced\nin small communities in the 19th century, and a Flat Earth\nSociety was formed in the 1950s. This community has been\nvery small historically. But with the growth of the internet, the\ncommunity of Flat-Earthers has grown considerably. In recent\nyears, many celebrities have at least said they doubt the official\naccount of the Earth\u2019s shape. Most famously, the rapper B. o.\nB. announced his skepticism and in 2017, started a campaign\nto send multiple satellites into space to document the true 306 | WHERE SEED BELIEFS COME FROM\nshape of the Earth. (Previous satellite missions apparently were\nnot trustworthy.)\nThere is something in the recent Flat-Earther phenomenon\nthat goes beyond a seed belief \u201caccidentally\u201d taking root in\nsomeone\u2019s set of beliefs. Many Flat-Earthers are eagerly\nembracing a belief precisely because it is at odds with the belief\nof a dominant culture; the act of rejecting a belief as obvious\nas the belief that the Earth is a sphere is a way to confront\nand deny the authority of the surrounding culture. The\nsurrounding culture (in this case) affirms the value of science\nand the value of a history of progress in knowledge, but it is\nalso a culture from which many people feel alienated, perhaps\nfor ideological, political, racial, or economic reasons. In this\ncase, accepting the seed belief is an act of rebellion against\nthat surrounding culture. It is a declaration that the dominant\nculture has no authority over the beliefs of the individual.\nThe deliberate acceptance of implausible seed beliefs also\nseems to be the primary cause of the QAnon conspiracy\ntheory. The fundamental QAnon seed belief is that the world\nis being run by a conspiracy of people who rape and eat\nchildren, worship Satan, and that Donald Trump is the only\nperson who can save the world from them. (It is sometimes WHERE SEED BELIEFS COME FROM | 307\nfurther claimed that the Satan-worshipping pedophiles are\nmembers of a lizard race that lives below the surface of the\nEarth.) The conspiracy theory associated with this seed belief\nmaintains that the U.S. government and governments around\nthe world have managed to keep these facts\nundiscovered\u2014except for one brave and anonymous\nindividual, known as \u201cQ,\u201d who was somehow able to thwart\nthe global conspiracy and post messages about it on 4chan,\nan online forum for various hate groups. None of the early\nadopters of this seed belief were raised to believe it, and never\nhas any positive evidence been given for it; rather, people\nembraced the ludicrous belief precisely because it was utterly\nludicrous, and in so doing, declared their epistemic\nemancipation from the entirety of world media, educational\ninstitutions, scientists, and governmental bodies.\nRecall the Baconian claim that knowledge itself is power. Some\nconspiracy theorists develop their theories in order to develop\na base of power to challenge the power of a dominant culture\u2019s\nknowledge. In such cases, proving the falsehood of the beliefs\nwill do nothing to diminish the believers\u2019 confidence in their\ntheories. The deeper issues of power inequities will have to\nbe addressed. Better epistemic practices will not be directly\nhelpful. 56.\nREAL CONSPIRACIES\nOf course, understanding that many conspiracy theories are\nfalse and believed for not fully rational reasons does not show\nthat there never are any actual conspiracies. Some of the more\ninfamous and true conspiracy theories in the United States\ninclude:\nDuring Prohibition (1920-1933), the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment poisoned industrial alcohol in an attempt to\ndiscourage bootleggers from using it to make alcoholic\nbeverages. But apparently not all bootleggers were\nconcerned with public health, and they produced and sold\nthe beverages anyway, resulting in thousands of deaths.\nThe government secretly continued the practice until the\nend of Prohibition, despite knowing its effects.\nIn 1932, the U.S. Public Health Service conducted an\nexperimental trial of a treatment for syphilis on several\nhundred African-American men in Tuskegee, Alabama,\nwithout securing their informed consent. Men with the REAL CONSPIRACIES | 309\ndisease were never given adequate treatment for it and were\nnever fully informed of their role in the experiment.\nIn 1972, President Richard Nixon authorized a break-in at\nthe headquarters of the Democratic National Committee\nin the Watergate Office Building and then unsuccessfully\ntried to cover up his administration\u2019s involvement.\nIn each of these cases, portions of the U.S. government\nconspired to commit harmful actions while keeping their role\nsecret. This meets the letter definition of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d which\nis when any group of people have a secret plan to do something\nillegal or harmful. Given that definition, we can plausibly\nsuspect that many actions by many governments result from\nconspiracies or secret plans to cause harm, particularly in the\nareas of espionage and counter-intelligence. Coming up with\nthese conspiracy theories\u2014 and determining how well they\nare supported by available evidence\u2014is the job of watchdog\norganizations, investigative reporters, and (later) historians.\nSo, there most definitely are conspiracies, and some conspiracy\ntheories are true. But not all of them are. So, we are brought\nonce again to the difficult epistemic challenge of trying to sort\nout the true from the false or the reasonable from the 310 | REAL CONSPIRACIES\nunreasonable. Are there any rules or indicators to help us\ndistinguish between plausible and implausible conspiracy\ntheories?\nThere are no rules that will reliably sort the true conspiracy\ntheories from the false ones, but the following rules may serve\nas a set of helpful indicators:\n1. The bigger and more powerful the conspiracy is\nsupposed to be, the less likely it is real. Anyone who has\nmanaged a sizable group project knows how hard it is to get\npeople to coordinate their efforts. The task becomes even\nharder, or impossible, if the shared effort is to cover up some\nharmful or immoral secret. So, the more people who must be\nincluded in the conspiracy, the bigger the lie that must be told,\nand the more harmful the thing being kept secret is, the more\nunlikely it is that a conspiracy will succeed.\n2. Hanlon\u2019s Razor: \u201cNever attribute to malice that which\nis adequately explained by stupidity.\u201d Many times, big\nevents happen for stupid reasons or for not really any single\nreason at all. We tend to think that significant events must\nhave significant causes, but in fact, the universe does not pay REAL CONSPIRACIES | 311\nattention to what we regard as significant. For example, the\nexplosion of the Hindenburg was a horrific disaster. A huge,\ngas-filled airship burst into flames, killing dozens of people.\nSome think it must have been sabotage because the event was\nso horrific. But it is more likely that the explosion was caused\nby static electricity, lightning, or engine failure. Sometimes,\nsignificant events happen for relatively unimpressive reasons.\n3. Beware of claims of conspiracy that cannot be falsified.\nThe frustrating aspect of thorough-going conspiracy theories\nis their seeming unfalsifiability. No matter what happens or\nwhatever is uncovered, it will end up being used as proof either\nof the theory or of just how crafty and manipulative the\nconspirators are. There is practically nothing that could prove\nto a Flat-Earther that the Earth is not flat, for example, as every\ncontrary bit of evidence is rejected as mere propaganda or as\nimproperly-interpreted data.\n4. Positing a conspiracy should be an explanation of last\nresort. Given how difficult it is to maintain any sizable\nconspiracy and how common it is that significant events\nhappen for insignificant reasons, positing a conspiracy should\nbe an explanation of last resort. If there is no more natural or\nplausible explanation of some event, and if we are sure that 312 | REAL CONSPIRACIES\nall the evidence is genuine, then perhaps we must posit that\nsome conspiracy is at work. But one must work with great\nhonesty and objectivity to determine whether the evidence to\nbe explained is genuine and whether there really is no more\nplausible explanation. One of the most popular quotes\nemployed by conspiracy theorists themselves is from Arthur\nConan Doyle\u2019s character Sherlock Holmes: \u201cWhen you have\neliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however\nimprobable, must be the truth.\u201d Conspiracy theorists proudly\nproclaim this dictum of a fictional detective as their justifying\nprinciple. The problem is that most conspiracy theorists are\nactually eager to reach for the improbable, and the\n\u201cimpossible\u201d explanations they have eliminated are perfectly\npossible, at least, once one has sorted out the real evidence\nfrom false or implausible reports.\nThese four considerations may help alert us to false conspiracy\ntheories in some cases. But, again, sometimes there are real\nconspiracies, and the theories about them are true. In the end,\nthe best advice that can be given is to take each theory on\nits own merits, assessing the plausibility of its claims given\nour prior beliefs, our general experience of the world, and the\nbasic attitude in Bayesian reasoning. We need to compare the\nlikelihood that we would be seeing the so-called evidence for\nthe theory if the theory were true against the likelihood that we\nwould be seeing it anyway even if the theory were false. 57.\nQUESTIONS TO\nCONSIDER\n1. Arguing against conspiracy theorists is often frustrating\nbecause the theorists seem to be able to handle any evidence\nthat goes against the theory. But then again, someone with a\ntrue theory should be able to handle any evidence that goes\nagainst the theory. So what\u2019s the difference?\n2. Being willing to change your mind when there is good\nevidence against what you believe is usually considered an\nepistemic virtue. But are there cases in which someone should\n\u201cstick to their guns\u201d\u2014that is, continue to defend their beliefs\ndespite good evidence to the contrary?\n3. (Paper assignment) Explore your favorite conspiracy theory.\n(A list of them can be found on Wikipedia\u2019s page \u201cList of\nconspiracy theories.\u201d) Write a short paper in which you briefly\nexplain the conspiracy theory, and then, examine the belief 314 | QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER\nusing what you have learned in this class. You might reflect\non what motivates someone to believe the theory, how the\ntheory\u2019s believers handle evidence against their theory, ways in\nwhich that defense of the theory is rational, and ways in which\nbelief in the theory is irrational. 58.\nFURTHER READING\nCoady, David. 2007. \u201cAre Conspiracy Theorists Irrational?\u201d\nEpisteme: A Journal of Social Epistemology 4 (2(Special Issue:\nConspiracy Theories)): 193\u2013204.\nKurtis Hagen (2018) \u201cConspiracy Theories and the Paranoid\nStyle: Do Conspiracy Theories Posit Implausibly Vast and Evil\nConspiracies?\u201d, Social Epistemology, 32:1, pp. 24-40.
