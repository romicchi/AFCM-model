Company or corporate culture is difficult to define but is extremely relevant to how\norganizations behave.\nKey Terms\nbehavior: The way a living creature acts.\nDefinition of Organizational Behavior\nOrganizational behavior studies the impact individuals, groups, and structures have on human behavior within organizations. It is an\ninterdisciplinary field that includes sociology, psychology, communication, and management. Organizational behavior complements\norganizational theory, which focuses on organizational and intra-organizational topics, and complements human-resource studies, which\nis more focused on everyday business practices.\nBehavior model: Diagram of Schein's\norganizational behavior model, which\ndepicts the three central components\nof an organization's culture: artifacts\n(visual symbols such as office dress\ncode), values (company goals and\nstandards), and assumptions (implicit,\nunacknowledged standards or biases).\nDifferent Types of Organizational Behavior\nOrganizational studies encompass the study of organizations from multiple perspectives, methods, and levels of analysis. \"Micro\"\norganizational behavior refers to individual and group dynamics in organizations. \"Macro\" strategic management and organizational\ntheory studies whole organizations and industries, especially how they adapt, and the strategies, structures, and contingencies that guide\nthem. Some scholars also include the categories of \"meso\"-scale structures, involving power, culture, and the networks of individuals in\norganizations, and \"field\"-level analysis, which studies how entire populations of organizations interact.\nMany factors come into play whenever people interact in organizations. Modern organizational studies attempt to understand and model\nthese factors. Organizational studies seek to control, predict, and explain. Organizational behavior can play a major role in organizational\ndevelopment, enhancing overall organizational performance, as well as also enhancing individual and group performance, satisfaction,\nand commitment.\nTopics in Organizational Behavior\nOrganizational behavior is particularly relevant in the field of management due to the fact that it encompasses many of the issues\nmanagers face on a daily basis. Concepts such as leadership, decision making, team building, motivation, and job satisfaction are all facets\nof organizational behavior and responsibilities of management. Understanding not only how to delegate tasks and organize resources but\nalso how to analyze behavior and motivate productivity is critical for success in management.\nOrganizational behavior also deals heavily in culture. Company or corporate culture is difficult to define but is extremely relevant to how\norganizations behave. A Wall Street stock-trading company, for example, will have a dramatically different work culture than an academic\ndepartment at a university. Understanding and defining these work cultures and the behavioral implications they embed organizationally\nis also a central topic in organizational behavior.\nWhy Study Organizational Theory?\nOrganizational theory studies organizations to identify how they solve problems and how they maximize efficiency and productivity.\nLearning Objectives\nDefine the value and applications of organizational theory from a business perspective.\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nCorrectly applying organizational theory can have several benefits for both the organization and society at large. Developments in\norganizations help boost economic potential in a society and help generate the tools necessary to fuel its capitalistic system.\nOnce an organization sees a window for expansion, it begins to grow and thus alters the economic equilibrium by catapulting itself\nforward. This expansion induces changes not only in the organization's infrastructure but also in competing organizations and the\neconomy as a whole.\nOne example of how development in organizational theory improves efficiency is in factory production. Henry Ford created the assembly\nline, a system of organization that enabled efficiency and drove both Ford and the U.S. economy forward.\nKey Terms\nefficiency: The extent to which a resource, such as electricity, is used for the intended purpose; the ratio of useful work to energy\nexpended.\nnormative: Of, pertaining to, or using a standard.\nDefinition of Organizational Theory\nOrganizational theory studies organizations to identify the patterns and structures they use to solve problems, maximize efficiency and\nproductivity, and meet the expectations of stakeholders. Organizational theory then uses these patterns to formulate normative theories\nof how organizations function best. Therefore, organizational theory can be used in order to learn the best ways to run an organization or\nidentify organizations that are managed in such a way that they are likely to be successful.\nOrganizational theory and stakeholders: Organizational theory\nexamines patterns in meeting stakeholders' needs. This concept\nmap illustrates common internal and external stakeholders: internal\nstakeholders include employees and managers, while external\nstakeholders include customers, suppliers, creditors, and society at\nlarge. A company must take all of these stakeholders' interests into\naccount.\nOrganizational Theory\nCorrectly applying organizational theory can have several benefits for both the organization and society at large. As many organizations\nstrive to integrate themselves into capitalistic societies, they initiate a ripple effect between other competing firms and already-existing\neconomic pressures. Once an organization sees a window for expansion, it begins to grow by producing more and thus alters the\neconomic equilibrium by catapulting itself forward into a new environment of production. This expansion induces changes not only in the\norganization's infrastructure but also in competing organizations and the economy as a whole. Other firms observe these innovative\ndevelopments and recreate them efficiently. Developments in organizations help boost economic potential in a society and help generate\nthe tools necessary to fuel its capitalistic system.\nOne example of how development in an organization affects the modern era is through factory production. The concept of factory\nproduction amplified production as a whole and allowed for the organized division of labor to start. It centralized facets of the workforce\nand began to define the rules of production and trade, which also led to specialization. Henry Ford implemented an innovative design by\nmodifying factory production and creating the assembly line, which is still used in many factories in contemporary society. These\ndevelopments make it easier for a company to produce and thus incentivize firms to aggregate and utilize more efficient methods for\nrunning their companies.\nOrganizational theory can also help identify malicious forms of corporate practice and use them to highlight future precautionary\nmeasures. The nuclear accident at Three Mile Island helped determine ways to ensure the prevention of similar incidents. In that case,\ndevelopments in organizational theory led to stronger government regulations and stronger production-related safety mandates.\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
