The community of\nargumentation scholars, who cross many borders, both geographically and academically,\nshares a generosity of spirit that is both inviting and energizing. I have been a fortunate\nbeneficiary of their munificence. An edited volume is reflective of a community working\ntogether to advance a conversation. As an editor, one relies upon insightful and\nconstructive reviews. All the authors in this volume served graciously as reviewers of\nanother author\u2019s paper. Others without essays in this volume gladly answered my need\nfor further reviewers. For that, I extend my deepest gratitude to Cristi\u00e1n Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez\nY\u00e1\u00f1ez and Frank Zenker.\nAs conversations ensued about what to do with the papers from the 2012 Wake\nForest Argumentation Conference in Venice, it was Hans Hansen who recommended a\nnew Wake Forest faculty member to edit a volume for the new Windsor Studies in\nArgumentation series. I will not soon forget such a kind gesture of trust and support.\nLikewise, Leo Groarke, Chris Tindale, and the rest of the staff at the Windsor Studies in\nArgumentation series have been exceptionally helpful in providing invaluable feedback\nand ushering this volume through the publication process.\nFinally, I would not have such an opportunity without the support of the directors\nof the Wake Forest Argumentation Conference: Frans van Eemeren, David Cratis\nWilliams, and my Wake Forest colleagues Michael David Hazen and Alessandra Von\nBurg. I am particularly grateful to David Williams, whose experience and invaluable\nassistance helped me navigate the process of bringing an edited volume to completion.\n1 Introduction-Dialogues in Argumentation\nRon Von Burg\nWake Forest University\nvonburrl@wfu.edu\nThe relationship between dialogue and argument enjoys a rich, intellectual\nhistory. The interactive nature of dialogue features in many approaches to the study of\nargument, from the dialectical to the rhetorical to the sociological. However, the virtues\nof argumentative dialogue in the academy are often liabilities beyond its wall. In the\ncontemporary moment, many outside the academy treat colloquial understandings of an\nargumentative dialogue as a good conversation ruined. The common usage of \u201cargument\u201d\nimplies confrontation and hostility, an indecorous turn that disrupts pleasant exchanges\npopulated with personal opinions. When such assertions face scrutiny, many are all too\nwilling to retreat to the dialogue-ending retort: \u201cWell, that\u2019s just my opinion.\u201d\nAs the circumference of argumentative dialogue widens to public spheres, we find\nthat quarrelsome discourse does not carry the same liabilities as it does in interpersonal\ndialogues. The echo chambers of modern media establishments that satisfy the tendency\nfor epistemic closure and opinion-affirmation are often the most conducive to\nconfrontational and combative discourse. Political talk show hosts of all ideological\nstripes hurl clich\u00e9d invectives at the opposition, forgoing any intellectual charity or\nsearch for commonalities. Moreover, a cursory glance at contemporary American\npolitical discourse reveals spirited and contentious disagreements that mask a dearth of\nargumentation acumen. Public debates over climate change, abortion rights, foreign\npolicy, and gun control, to name a few, are some of the most strident disagreements\nriddled with fallacious reasoning, poor evidence usage, and unsupported claims. Political\ndebates in Europe and Canada, unfortunately, do not fare much better.\nFor argumentation scholars, this is a troubling phenomenon. Argument should be\na celebrated concept, a testament to the virtues of sound reasoning, credible evidence, and\njustifiable rationality. Argument, while inviting clash, need not be confrontational but a\nproductive pursuit of resolving disagreement, guiding action, and advancing knowledge.\nIn navigating the muddy waters between theory and practice, argumentation scholars who\nstudy argument as it happens and aspire to offer correctives when rationality and reason\nare lacking will find a bevy of opportunities for scholarly and pedagogical intervention.\nPrevious collections of argumentation scholarship, such as van Eemeren and\nHoutlosser\u2019s (2005) edited volume Argumentation in Practice, highlight the importance\nof studying argument praxis, encouraging theoretically informed criticism of actual\nargumentative practices. Such volumes, and the field of argumentation studies in general,\nbenefit from enriching interdisciplinary conversations that bring into dialogue multiple\nmethodologies and distinct cultural interests to lay a foundation for new opportunities to\nimprove argument praxis and criticism.\nThis collection reflects a similar spirit, asking tough questions of ourselves and of\nthe argumentative practices we study, especially in the contemporary moment when\npublic dialogue is marked by truculence and discord. This volume, which brings together\nselected essays from the 2006 11th Wake Forest University Biennial Argumentation\n2 Conference held at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida and the 2012 14th\nWake Forest University Biennial Argumentation Conference held at Casa Artom in\nVenice, Italy, emerges from a rich history of conferences that seek to meld theory and\npractice, advancing a dialogue about argumentation well beyond national as well as\ndisciplinary borders.\nThe Wake Forest University Biennial Argumentation Conference began in 1982 as\na biennial event to help promote argumentation scholarship among directors of\nintercollegiate debate.1 The first three iterations of the Conference were held on the Wake\nForest University campus in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, before alternating between\nthe main Wake Forest campus and the Wake Forest University Venice, Italy campus\u2014\nCasa Artom\u2014in 1988, with the exception of the 2006 Biennial Conference held at\nFlorida Atlantic University. The Biennial Argumentation Conference boasts a rich history\nof producing exceptional argumentation scholarship, from edited volumes2 to special\nissues of flagship argumentation journals3 to landmark essays in notable rhetoric and\nargumentation journals.4 This volume seeks to be part of that storied tradition by\nincluding essays from numerous celebrated argumentation studies scholars who engage\nfundamental questions about the breakdown of argumentative dialogue and how\nargumentation studies can provide insight into stalled public dialogue.\nDavid Zarefsky, in his opening essay \u201cOn Deep Disagreement,\u201d identifies the\nwidening chasm between the vibrant and historically rich study of argumentation and its\ncontemporary practice in various deliberative spaces. Zarefsky notes that deep\ndisagreement\u2014a \u201ccontroversy all the way down in an infinite regress [where] there is no\nshared framework that can serve the arguers as a common standard or point of reference\u201d\n(12)\u2014plagues our contemporary discourse. The disjuncture between argumentation\ntheory and the practice of argumentation, where deep disagreement is commonplace,\nprovides an opportunity for further scholarly intervention.\nHansen pulls on a similar thread, identifying unique contributions of\nargumentation studies on argument practices beyond the academy. Hansen illuminates\nthis challenge by posing a series of provocative questions: why study argumentation? If\nall disciplines promote argumentation, what is the unique value-added of an\nargumentation studies discipline for the academy and beyond? These questions of\ndisciplinary anxiety have troubled many other disciplines, including one of\n1 For a detailed history of the Wake Forest Argumentation Conference, see Williams, D. C. & Hazen. M.

Do analogies serve as sufficient\nproof or persuasive fallacies? Hample\u2019s contribution to this volume, which is part of a\nlarger series of studies on defeasible arguments in conversation, engages such questions\nby testing the argumentative force of analogies when introduced into conversation. The\nexperiment tests whether analogies introduced into a conversation have a convergent\neffect in supporting a position. In confirming the suspicions of argumentation theorists,\nanalogies are often greeted critically, and do not possess a cumulative effect in promoting\nadherence to a specific claim.\nBlair moves us from the practical to the normative, investigating the possibility of\nan ethics of argumentation. Argumentation theory is rife with discussions of norms,\nethics, and judgment, but there remains the question of whether there exists a moral\nnormativity with argumentation itself. For Blair, the answer is \u201cunder certain\ncircumstances.\u201d Blair rejects the idea of a \u201cnon-moral\u201d form of argumentation that is\nentirely free from any ethical or moral obligations, contending that under certain\ncircumstances and in special cases moral normativity of argumentation has pro tanto\napplications.\nDebates often materialize when there is a disagreement over values. But in the\ncurrent discursive climate where unassailable scientific evidence and notarized birth\ncertificates are treated as hoaxes and conspiracies, Klumpp contends that the breakdown\nin social argument is not a disagreement over values, but a discrepancy in facts. Klumpp\nlocates this breakdown in a burgeoning distrust of institutions that provide factual\ninformation for public deliberations: mass media and government. Klumpp notes \u201c[o]ur\ndemocracy avoided the problems of anomie because in the end we had recourse to these\ntwo institutions to provide reliable starting points to resolve the controversies of\ndemocratic dispute. At the dawn of the 21st century, however, these institutions have\nfailed. The result is a weakened civic argument\u201d (97). Repairing civic argument,\nhowever, is a herculean task, one that requires focused engagement with the very features\nthat have complicated contemporary public argument.\nIn a similar spirit, Bruner challenges assumptions concerning the relationship\nbetween the rational and the reasonable. By putting Husserl, Derrida, and Perelman into\ndialogue to flesh out the relationship between these concepts, Bruner identifies a more\nuniversal meta-reason that better helps our understanding of political transformation. In\nthis impressive engagement with luminaries of critical theory and modern western\nphilosophy, Bruner suggests that by revealing the rational dimensions of the reasonable,\nwe are better equipped to unearth the \u201cstructuring fictions\u201d that inform political reason.\n5 Similar questions have dogged rhetorical studies, whereby identifying the ubiquity of rhetoric\nthreatens the uniqueness of its theoretical and critical insights. This debate is captured in Gross and\nKeith\u2019s edited volume, Rhetorical Hermeneutics. Dilip Goankar\u2019s opening essay calls into question the\ntheoretical viability of rhetoric of science; the nature of this critique is equally applicable to\nrhetorical studies writ large. The subsequent essays offer extensions and rebuttals to Goankar\u2019s\ndiscipline questioning critique (see Gross & Keith (eds.), 1997).\n4 Bruner contends that argumentation scholars are in a unique position to explore the\nrepressed and rhetorically unconsciousness elements in public argument, rendering such\nstructuring fictions visible.\nThe poststructuralist turn and the rise of social constructivism have certainly\ntaken their toll on the status of facts in public debates. Therefore, it is rather ironic that\nthe Internet, and its promise as a democratizing technology, is also a hyperreal bastion of\nunsupported \u201cfacts\u201d and rancorous opinions. Yet, the Internet is an undeniable force in\npublic argument. Goodnight engages features of cyberspace, specifically the meme, to\ndemonstrate how the Internet changes argumentative culture, even as it has roots in the\ndiscursive practices of the past.\nThe second half of the volume brings into dialogue a series of case studies,\ninformed by a variety of methodologies, from Pragma-dialectics to rhetorical criticism,\nthat outline the features of contemporary public argument. These case studies draw from\na variety of international settings, including the Egyptian presidential race, the European\nParliament, Russian politic, American institutions, and visual apologias. Each case study\nprovides an important insight into the role of public argument in contexts with differing\ninstitutional relationships with democratic deliberation.\nAlthough many of these deliberative institutions seek to resolve disagreements\nwith a yes or no binary, most of the deliberations are rarely two-sided affairs with distinct\nand exclusive interests in the resolution. Strategic maneuvering, an aspect of Pragma-\ndialectics\u2019 engagement with rhetorical forms of argument, highlights how parties\nnavigate multi-dimensional debates. In \u201cDialectics and Polylogues: The Case of Multi-\nparty Deliberations,\u201d Lewi\u0144ski examines the deliberations during the 2012 presidential\nelections in Egypt to promote the concept of argumentative polylogues to account for the\nlimitations in dialogics in multiparty deliberations. Lewi\u0144ski draws upon strategic\nmanoeuvring to account for the shifting focus during electoral debates for the three\ncandidates for the Egyptian presidency, revealing the limitations of issue-based and role-\nbased dialectics in decision-making where there are more than two solutions.\nMohammed turns our attention from decision-making in multi-party deliberations\nto a single interlocutor navigating multiple institutional and discursive goals.\nMohammed\u2019s examination of European Parliament deliberations over immigration and\nthe Schengen Agreement reveals how concessions functioned as strategic maneuvering to\nachieve distinct argumentative goals and promote positive outcomes for more than one\nstandpoint at the same time. Mohammed highlights how such strategic maneuvering\ndiscloses numerous institutional features of the European Parliament that shape the\ndeliberative process.\nWhereas deliberative settings often accommodate such maneuverings, the\ndemocratic legitimacy of the judicial arena relies, purportedly, on avoiding overtly\npolitical argument. However, Placone argues that the Supreme Court of the United States,\nideally a nonpartisan entity that adjudicates disputes based on the soundness of one\u2019s\narguments, is a \u201cpolitical\u201d institution. Placone notes that the Casey opinion, a case\ndetermining access to abortion services, blends both deliberative and forensic discourses,\ndeciding arguments not solely on their judicial merit, but also their political ramifications.\nPlacone\u2019s essay calls for greater scholarly attention to amicus curie briefs, which appeal\nto deliberative arguments to influence judicial judgments.\n5 For a volume that seeks to advance dialogues about argumentation, it is fitting\nthat we begin with deep disagreement and conclude with reconciliation. Winkler\u2019s essay\nhighlights the important, but often overlooked, role visual images play in apologia and\nreconciliation. She contends that in the age of the Internet and recirculating images,\nunderstanding how visual depictions of apologia function argumentatively is essential for\nrecognizing ways to advance healing and dialogue.\nThe essays in this volume demonstrate how dialogues, be they across time,\ncontext, or methodology, offer new insights into argumentative practice. At their best,\ndialogues celebrate a sense of openness, a freedom for interlocutors to share thoughts\nunfettered by ubiquitous forces that silence or fetter such an exchange. At their worst,\ndialogues devolve into solipsism or polemics, an interaction where common ground\nremains elusive, and perhaps even avoided, where the interlocutors have little to no\nregard for the utterances of others. In a moment marked by deep disagreement,\nproductive argumentative dialogues are essential. The volume, which brings together\nsome of the finest scholars in argumentation studies, hopes to be a step in that direction.\nReferences\nvan Eemeren, F.H. & Houtlosser, P. (eds.). (2005).

This essay discusses what deep disagreement is,\nargues that it has become more frequent and serious, and then maps out a range of\nargument patterns that may be signs of its appearance: polemic, condemnation, paradigm\nshift, and interdependence. Finally, the essay suggests that rhetorical moves may be\nneeded to alter the frame of reference and transcend the disagreement. Most of the\nexamples come from the United States, because I know it best, but I believe that my\nclaims are applicable generally.\nKey words: deep disagreement, argumentative impasse, polemic, paradigm shift,\ntranscendence of conflict\n1. The notion of deep disagreement\nContemporary argumentation research is sophisticated and robust, marked by rich\ntheoretical and critical inquiry, with programmatic pursuits under such headings as\ninformal logic, rhetorical criticism, pragma-dialectics, polemics, and dialogue logic, and\nsupported by an infrastructure of conferences, journals, and books. The practice of\nargumentation, in contrast, is impoverished. Extensive reconstruction is needed to make\nanything like arguments out of much public discourse and, rather than engage each other,\nopposing arguments often reach an impasse. Meanwhile, at least in the English language,\nargumentation has the connotations of quarrelsomeness, contentiousness, or barely\nsublimated violence. In short, argumentation does not enjoy a good reputation and is not\npracticed very well.\nThis condition is apparent immediately to those immersed in U.S. politics. This\nstate of argumentative deadlock extends far beyond American shores, however. It\nincludes those who were trying to respond to the precarious state of the euro in 2012 and\n2013, those trying to advance the Arab spring of 2011 to whatever its next phase might\nbe, and those who were trying to \u201creset\u201d relationships between the United States and\nPakistan, or for that matter, the United States and Russia. It seems that at many spaces in\nthe public sphere, men and women are unable to use argumentation as a means of\ndeliberation, decision, and action. Instead, intentionally or not, argumentation often\nthwarts those objectives and results in stalemated discourse.\nThere is a term to describe this state of affairs. It was put forward by the\nAmerican philosopher Robert J. Fogelin nearly 30 years ago, almost offhandedly in a\nrelatively informal essay (Fogelin, 1985). The term is deep disagreement. It is the\nantithesis of superficial difference and refers to a situation in which there is controversy\nall the way down in an infinite regress: there is no shared framework that can serve the\narguers as a common standard or point of reference. Although Fogelin coined the\n7 contemporary term, the concept of deep disagreement can be traced back to the sceptics\nof antiquity.\nIn proposing this construct, Fogelin noted \u2013 as have many other writers \u2013 the\nparadox that one cannot have productive disagreement without some underlying\nagreement (Fogelin, 1985; Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969: 65; Ehninger, 1958: 28;\nBrockriede, 1975: 182; MacIntyre, 1984: 8). The need for an underlying stratum of\nagreement among disputants arises from the fact that, outside of formal reasoning, there\nare no universally accepted standards of judgment. Acceptability therefore depends upon\nconsensus among the arguers in a given case. If I advance a claim and you doubt it, I\nmust provide a warrant for it that will satisfy you or some third party we both have\nselected to adjudicate the dispute. If, say, my warrant comes from the Bible and you\nregard the Bible as a work of fiction with no status as an authoritative text, then I must\neither stop and legitimate the Bible as a warrant or else come up with some other warrant.\nIf you do not accept the authority of that warrant either, then I must find something else\nyet. To resolve our disagreement, we need to find some common standard to which we\ncan both appeal and then see which of our appeals is more compelling. If arguers go on\nand on, unable to find any common basis for judgment until, in Professor Griffin\u2019s\nfelicitous phrase, \u201cthe well of invention runs dry\u201d (Griffin, 1952: 186), then our infinite\nregress produces the condition that Fogelin labeled deep disagreement. Interlocutors may\nwithdraw in frustration, or the dispute may proceed indefinitely without any advance.\nFogelin assumed that such situations would be rare. In normal argumentation, he\nbelieved, there is a whole web of unstated assumptions that the parties share and that are\nnon-problematic. These include assumptions about what counts as evidence, what counts\nas proof, what procedures will be followed, and what are some of the basic axioms or\nbeliefs of the culture to which arguers explicitly or implicitly stipulate. These do not enter\ninto the argument unless either party has an occasion to question them, and on such\noccasions they are readily identifiable and can be addressed without an infinite regress. It\nwas only on very infrequent occasions, he believed, such as conflicts among\nphilosophical schools, that all the elements of this assumptive structure would be\nknocked out. If that happened, the result would be deep disagreement that seemingly\ncould not be resolved. Fogelin evidently had in mind the model of dialogue between\nphilosophers on timeless questions, so he did not assume that deep disagreement on such\nmatters necessarily would be harmful. The fact that contemporaries dispute many of the\nsame questions that challenged the ancients is not regarded as a problem. There is no\nurgency requiring speedy resolution. Fogelin advises the arguers in such a case to pursue\n\u201cnon-rational\u201d means of persuasion because those are the only means available. This\nadvice muddies the waters because Fogelin does not identify what his standard of\nrationality is. Presumably he judges rhetorical appeals that do not meet formal standards\nof argumentation as non-rational.\n2. Re-examining Fogelin\nOn the twentieth anniversary of the publication of Fogelin\u2019s essay, the journal\nInformal Logic reprinted the article (Fogelin, 2005) and featured a set of responses that\nshow that the original article remained controversial. Fogelin continues to attract\nrespondents from time to time. Dana Phillips criticizes Fogelin for exaggerating the\nextent of the shared assumptive framework that was necessary for argumentation to take\nplace. For Phillips, agreed-upon substantive beliefs are not required, only procedural\n8 rules. In order to understand each other at all, the arguers \u201cmust agree on the meanings of\nat least some terms or signs,\u201d but \u201cthe potential for fruitful argument does not require any\ncommon beliefs\u201d (Phillips, 2008: 87-88). Phillips implies that Fogelin is being overly\npessimistic about the possibility of finding underlying agreement and hence that Fogelin\nis too quick to give up on argumentation.\nIn a different critique, David Adams (2005) finds Fogelin\u2019s conception even less\nuseful, since even if in fact there are no common anchors for an argument, there is no\nway that the participants in an actual dispute could know that to be the case. Accordingly,\nthey never know when to make the switch from presumably rational to non-rational\nmeans of appeal. Therefore they ought to continue as before, pursuing the search for a\ncommon foundation to their dispute. If that is what happens, then the concept of deep\ndisagreement has no practical use. It describes a state of affairs that may or may not exist\nbut in any case cannot be experienced.\nDale Turner and Larry Wright (2005) advance a different complaint: that the\nalternative decision-making methods to which Fogelin defaults are not necessarily non-\nrational. There are many disputes, they note, that turn on \u201cwhat is to count as proper\nunderstanding and genuine competence as much as (\u2026) the substantive topic,\u201d and\nobserve that if all these depend upon non-rational resolution, \u201cthen much of the\nmotivation for the appeal to argument in such disputes is undermined\u201d (Turner & Wright,\n2005: 30). Instead, even while they suggest that arguers can try to \u201cwalk back\u201d the\ndisagreement to neutral ground and then proceed carefully, step by step, they nevertheless\nacknowledge that in practice rational decision-making activities are embroiled \u201cin a\ncomplicated mix of friendly cajoling, facile eloquence, strategic positioning, social\npressure, verbal threats, and pure negotiation\u201d (Turner & Wright, 2005: 33) and that \u201cthe\nfelt urgency of these issues naturally undermines the patience required to treat a subject\nof this depth and subtlety\u201d (Turner & Wright, 2005: 32). The difficulty with this critique\nis that neither Turner and Wright, nor Fogelin, has offered clear criteria for what counts\nas rational. While the word \u201crationality\u201d is used primarily as an epithet, one detects that\nTurner and Wright believe that argumentation can be used more extensively than Fogelin\nthinks, notwithstanding its susceptibility to the claim that it produces deep disagreement.\nFinally, there is the critique of Vesel Memedi (2007), who points out that the\nseeming intransigence that can develop in a two-person dialogue can be mitigated by\nbringing into play a third-party judge. This changes the task by orienting the advocates to\npersuading the judge, not each other. There is much sense to this suggestion, but it does\nnot deny that deep disagreements still arise between the advocates, or between any of the\nadvocates and a third party.\nIn sum, then, the critiques of Fogelin do not dissolve the problem of deep\ndisagreement. Fogelin examines deep disagreement as a philosophical condition, a\nconceptual impasse that results when arguers\u2019 assumptions in fact are irreconcilable so\nthat there is no way they can find a common foundation. In such a case, more argument\nwill not help them; they can resolve their dispute only by non-argumentative means of\npersuasion. Understandably, a philosophical deep disagreement is rare. But there is also\nthe much more common case in which arguers behave as if they were in a state of deep\ndisagreement, whether or not a philosopher would agree that such is the case. If\nadvocates behave as if there is \u201creal\u201d deep disagreement, they will produce the same\nconsequences whether the deep disagreement is real or not. In such a case, more rather\n9 than less argument is called for. This may include rhetorical moves that enlist what\nFogelin appears to regard as non-rational means of persuasion. They can be employed for\nthe rational purpose of exposing the lack of \u201creal\u201d deep disagreement and thereby\nopening a path for reconciliation. The remainder of this essay will examine\ndisagreements of this latter type.\n3. The frequency of apparent deep disagreement\nTwo factors make at least the appearance of deep disagreement in contemporary\nargumentation practice far more frequent than either Fogelin or his critics imagine: the\nrise of religious fundamentalism around the world, resulting in the interpretation of issues\nas matters of moral certainty, and the discovery (particularly in the U.S.) that polarization\nenacting the posture of deep disagreement \u2013 whether or not sincerely felt \u2013 is politically\nuseful.\n3.1 Religious fundamentalism\nWithin many of the world\u2019s major religions, the past generation has seen a\nresurgence of fundamentalism. This is true of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, evangelical\nChristianity, and radical Islam. In general, fundamentalists believe that it is possible to\nknow God\u2019s will for sure. They therefore reject the assumption of human fallibility and\nthe resulting tolerance for diverse viewpoints. If one knows God\u2019s will for sure, there is\nno reason to tolerate error by others. Rather, fundamentalists view their task as the\ndiscovery of God\u2019s true word, its proclamation, and its infusion into social discourse and\npractices. Politics, for example, is not seen as an area separate from religion, but as one of\nthe sites in which religion works its influence. Politics normally is understood as an arena\nfor compromise. But if politics is regarded as an outlet for moral truths, then it is not\nopen to compromise (Zarefsky, 2012a). Even seemingly long-settled social values, such\nas a woman\u2019s right of access to contraception, are back on the table, at least in the United\nStates, if the seeming resolution offends fundamentalists. And what might seem like a\npragmatic compromise in the Affordable Care Act (popularly known as Obamacare) \u2013\nrecognizing women\u2019s right of access to contraception without requiring the church to pay\nfor it if it disapproved \u2013 was regarded by true believers as a sellout because it ceded the\nprinciple that contraception is immoral. If argumentation proceeds in such a vein, it is not\nsurprising that deep disagreement will often arise. Between the claim that one knows\nGod\u2019s word for sure and the claim that it is impossible to do so, an impasse will develop\nquickly.\n(I focus on religious fundamentalism because it is widespread, but a counterpart\ndevelopment, at least in the United States and other advanced democracies, is the\nprevalence of \u201crights talk,\u201d the claim that something or other accrues to human beings as\na right because of their humanity. If health care, employment, or personal safety, for\nexample, is a right, then prudential arguments against its necessity or value have no\ntraction. Things that are clearly rights are not subject to dispute. \u201cRights talk\u201d has the\nsame argument-stopping character as religious fundamentalism. Ultimate appeals to\nreligion tend to characterize the ideological right and appeals to rights tend to\ncharacterize the ideological left, but both are forms of fundamentalism.)\n3.2 Political polarization\nPolitical polarization, too, brings with it seemingly irreconcilable disputes,\nbecause the underlying political ideologies are fundamentally at odds. From its history as\na two-party nation in which both parties are broad-based coalitions, the United States has\n10 moved over the past 30 years in the direction of ideologically distinct parties\ncharacteristic of a parliamentary system but without the presence of multiple parties\ncreating the need for coalition building. Even in parliamentary democracies, though, deep\ndisagreement can thwart the effort to build coalitions, as a minor party being approached\nto join a coalition may be able effectively to stalemate an argument by requiring major-\nparty acceptance of their extreme moral position as the price of joining a coalition. This is\npart of the explanation for the near-failure to form a Greek government in May of 2012,\nand more generally for the turmoil in the euro zone and in the Middle East. In the United\nStates, political party identification is the single greatest predictor of polarization. In\nparticular, according to a study from the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings\nInstitution, \u201cRepublicans in particular have become so extreme that compromise is all but\nimpossible\u201d (Lightman, 2012: sec. 1, 24). The likely alternatives, then, are capitulation by\none side or deep disagreement.\nCampaigning for the U.S. presidency in 2008, Barack Obama promised an\nalternative to the partisan deadlock that had gripped Washington for decades. What he\nprobably did not realize was that his stance of rejecting partisanship ceded control of\npublic perceptions to his political opponents. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\nannounced after the 2010 midterm elections that the very top priority for the Republican\ncaucus was to make Obama a one-term president. As a practical matter, this entailed\nopposing whatever the president might support, sometimes only because he had\nsupported it, even if it was something like the individual mandate in the health care bill\nthat originally was a Republican idea. If these are the argumentative strategies, an\nimpasse will develop quickly. It is important to note that there may not in fact be deep\ndisagreement; the parties may be less polarized than people think. What matters is that\nthey are able to behave as if they were, and that can trigger the same argumentative\nimpasse. This will happen when either of the parties has an incentive to stymie action, as\nthe minority party especially will, and particularly when they can cite such divisiveness\nas proof that the president has failed in his effort to rise above partisan divisions. They\nhave every incentive to create a situation that they then can cite as evidence of their\nopponents\u2019 failures.\nThe point here is that it may not matter whether arguers truly are in deep\ndisagreement; behaving as if they were is just as effective. And the ability so to behave\ncalls into question Fogelin\u2019s assumption that deep disagreement is rare. Indeed, deep\ndisagreements might be quite prevalent, because there are no empirical facts that will\nresolve them. At what point a \u201cfetus\u201d becomes a \u201cperson\u201d is not a question of fact but of\ndefinition. Skilled arguers usually can find ways to avoid accepting definitions that harm\ntheir strategic interest. And not only on moral issues but even on seemingly prudential\nquestions such as the debt ceiling in the United States, a recurrent controversy can be\nidentified, in which the appropriateness of raising taxes or cutting spending are often\ndiscussed as if they were non-compromisable moral absolutes, even though an impartial\nobserver could identify political \u201cgrand bargains\u201d that draw something from the positions\nclaimed by each side.\n4. Argumentative indicators of apparent deep disagreement\n11 That being so, scholars need to understand far better what argumentation looks\nlike as a controversy evolves into deep disagreement. Here I would like to consider four\nbasic scenarios, any of which may be taken as a sign of deep disagreement.\n4.1 Polemic\nPolemic is a mode of discourse in which the aim is not compromise or agreement\nbut victory over the opponent through the evacuation of his or her rhetorical position.\nThis is done through persistent attack, whether on the opponent\u2019s truthfulness, character,\nmotivation, leadership ability, goals, designs, or methods. Except for the fact of intense\nopposition, consistency of position is not required of the polemicist. The polemicist is not\nout to defend a position of his or her own but to undermine the opposing position through\npersistent attack. What theorists of debate call \u201cstraight refutation\u201d is the polemicist\u2019s\ngoal.\nShould the adversary appear to yield ground or make a conciliatory gesture, the\npolemicist may shift ground in order to maintain the opposition stance. The polemicist\nseeks continual conflict, not agreement. The language of the polemicist usually is intense;\nhe or she is armed with the certainty that the opponent is wrong and the confidence that\nthe polemicist enjoys divine sanction. Every argumentative encounter is Armageddon and\nthe stakes always are total.\nPolemic can be either one- or two-sided. When the response to a polemic is\nanother polemic (two-sided polemic), the temperature of the argument rises very quickly\nand the advocates will be likely to engage in mutual recrimination and character\nassassination. This is because both arguers are committed to defeating the opponent, not\nto resolving the issue. Third-party observers will be as likely to say \u201ca plague on both\nyour houses\u201d as to try to ferret out and understand the underlying argument.\nAlternatively, a polemic can be one-sided if it is answered not in kind but with a plea for\nrestoring the norms of civility, calmness, and reasoned discourse. In this circumstance,\nthe polemicist\u2019s tone and intensity are used to discredit the worth of his or her position. If\nthe position were tenable, the interlocutor maintains, it would not be necessary to mask it\nwith the shrillness of tone and the indecorousness of the attack. The polemicist might\ncounter that it is immoral to remain calm and neutral about a matter that by rights should\nevoke outrage, and thereby can seek to reclaim dominance of the argument. And so the\nencounter will proceed, with the competitors trying to inflict damage on each other and\nultimately to delegitimize one of the positions so that the other might survive.\nFor the most part, polemic is not taken seriously as a form of argument; often it is\nseen as argument\u2019s antithesis. The most sustained research program on polemic is that of\nRuth Amossy and her colleagues at Tel Aviv University (Amossy, 2010; see also Kraus,\n2012). Using the approach of French discourse analysis, they regard polemic as a combat\nbetween discourses rather than between arguers. They are able to depersonalize the\nobjects of their study and to identify the structures and dynamics of these contests in\norder to identify how one discourse engages another. Their plea is that polemic be taken\nseriously as a type of argument. This is a particularly important admonition if, as I have\nsuggested, polemic is a frequent indicator of deep disagreement. It is not too much of an\nexaggeration to say that contemporary political campaigns are largely polemical \u2013 this,\nafter all, is usually what is meant by the term \u201cnegative campaigning.\u201d They are attacks\non the opponent, buttressed by what appears to be evidence but is likely to be false or\n12 misleading. The conclusion of the message may extrapolate well beyond the scope of the\nargument, finding in it demonstrative proof that the candidate is unfit for public office.\nThe various \u201cad watch\u201d efforts can be seen as attempts to regulate polemic and to subject\nit to analysis under the light of day.\n4.2 Condemnation\nA second type of discourse that develops in situations of deep disagreement is\ncondemnation of the impasse itself, usually accompanied by blaming the other party for\nstarting or perpetuating this situation. The parties both conclude that they are unable to\nresolve their differences but each believes that this state of affairs is undesirable, the fault\nof the other party, and risky (perhaps because a third party expects them to compromise\nin order to reach agreement), so what ensues is a struggle for public perception. Each\nparty tries to portray itself as the embodiment of reason, having made sensible and\ngenerous offers and then having gone the extra mile to reach agreement, only to be\nrebuffed by the intransigence of the other side. This is a common approach in the\naftermath of failed labor-management negotiations. Its use is a means to coax the\nopposing party back to the negotiating table or to blame the opponents for a strike if one\nresults. A similar move may be used in the face of failure to resolve a legislative\nstalemate or to reconcile differences in proposed bills seeking the same objective. Or it\ncan be employed in a case of unsuccessful diplomacy.\nThis form of argument acknowledges that the parties are in a state of deep\ndisagreement. It appeals to the other party, who is presumed to be in the wrong, to make\nsome concession in order to get the argument (back) on a constructive track. It can be\nsuccessful, but only if one side can seize upon widely popular topoi and quickly establish\nits position as the more plausible, putting pressure on the other party to yield. Otherwise\ncondemnation, like polemic, is likely to stalemate with a reciprocal exchange of charges,\nleading a neutral third party to regard both positions as irresponsible.\n4.3 Paradigm shift\nA third possible sign of deep disagreement is the paradigm shift. One makes the\nargument in a different paradigm reflecting a different world-view. Reality is seldom\nunivocal but can be imagined in different ways through the use of different approaches to\ntalking about it. If there exist multiple paradigms or world-views for considering a topic,\nand an advocate shifts from one to another, this may be a sign that the disputants have\nreached deep disagreement within the original paradigm. What happens here is not that\nthe advocate invents a new paradigm but rather that he or she selects from the paradigms\nalready available.\nO\u2019Gorman (2012) demonstrates how this was so with respect to the ideologies of\nthe early Cold War. Different ideological perspectives were \u201cout there\u201d and advocates\nmight switch from one to another if the initial paradigm produced an impasse. More\ngenerally, Kuhn (1970) has argued that scientific revolutions are less the result of a\ntheory\u2019s being conclusively discredited than of one framework or worldview\u2019s coming to\nbe regarded as more sensible or a better explanation of the facts than another. This\nsuggests that an impasse between competing positions might give rise to a judgment that\none or the other \u201cfeels right\u201d or makes more sense.\n13 It is not necessary that the competing paradigms are logically incompatible,\nalthough the impasse between them may be more obvious if they are. It is only necessary\nthat they work at cross-purposes so that one would not want to pursue both. A good\nexample of deep disagreement expressed in alternative paradigms was found in a 2012\nissue of the New York Times. By coincidence, the op-ed page included two essays on the\nsame day addressing the ideology apparently undergirding the current Republican Party\nin the United States (Krugman, 2012; Brooks, 2012). One, by Paul Krugman, lambastes\nthe Republicans for their attacks on government spending, ridicules their belief that there\nis substantial bureaucratic waste that could be cut, and concludes that the Republicans\nreveal their true colors when they imply that it is better to fire teachers and policemen\nthan to yield their pigheaded refusal to raise taxes for any reason. The other essay, by\nDavid Brooks, tries to position the Republicans in such a way that their refusal to raise\ntaxes is not obstinate or pigheaded, but principled. He does so by imagining this behavior\nwithin a different paradigm, one that regards the welfare state as obsolete and\nirremediable, treats any significant public spending as throwing good money after bad\nand delaying the necessary transition to a new way of imaging our society, and thus\nviews any increase in taxes as wasteful if not perverse. Krugman and Brooks are not\nadvocating incompatible propositions but they do lead in very different directions.\nHaving reached a stalemate over the question, \u201cAre we a welfare state or not?\u201d Krugman\nand Brooks each describe the kind of society he envisions, within the contexts of very\ndifferent worldviews. The inability to engage these worldviews directly is a sign of deep\ndisagreement.\n4.4 Interdependence\nA fourth maneuver indicating deep disagreement is interdependence. This\napproach seeks to induce antagonists to embrace a standpoint that otherwise would be\nobjectionable in order to secure a desired standpoint that otherwise would be vulnerable.\nIt is most likely to succeed when there is a package proposal whereby each arguer is able\nto secure his or her primary interest only by yielding on an interest of lesser priority. If,\nfor example, you are opposed to abortion and I am opposed to restrictions on abortion,\nwhile I favor a single-payer health care system while you are opposed to government\nfinancing of health care, we actually might have the makings of an agreement. You might\nbe willing to go along with single-payer health care, even though you don\u2019t like it, if you\ncould assure yourself that no funds under the health care program will be used to support\nabortion, assurance that I am reluctant to provide. In this example, each of us could\nprotect what he or she valued most, but our ability to do so was dependent on our linking\nit to a position that we found objectionable but less important. But this approach is more\nlikely to mark than to resolve deep disagreement, because arguers are reluctant to alter\ntheir commitments even if they can secure a fundamental value by doing so. In\nnegotiations, people tend to focus more on what they stand to lose than on what they\nstand to gain.\nA historical example of an attempt at interdependence is the settlement of the\nMexican-American War in 1848. The United States acquired vast new territory and\nneeded to provide for some form of civil government. Few people either North or South\nthought it likely that slave-owners would wish to move to these new lands, because the\nclimate was deemed inhospitable. Nevertheless, many Northerners wanted to add a\n14 specific prohibition of slavery, in order to assure that result, while many Southerners\nregarded such prohibition as an offense against honor. Neither party saw large practical\nconsequences riding on the outcome but neither would yield on a point of principle, so\nthe argument remained at an impasse. Not until these positions both became parts of a\nlarger compromise package could the argument proceed. And this package, the\nCompromise of 1850, was soon and easily pulled apart a few years later, when each party\nconcluded it had given up far more value than it had been able to protect. The deep\ndisagreement between Northern and Southern world-views ultimately was resolved not\nthrough argument but through the American Civil War.\n5. Transcendence of deep disagreement\nAs has been explained, it is more likely that the above moves will sustain rather\nthan resolve deep disagreement. That may not be a problem if an enduring stalemate can\nbe tolerated, as it can when discussing some conflicts in metaphysics or axiology. But\nwhen movement toward a decision is required, one must find some way to transcend the\ndeep disagreement. This cannot be done within the framework of the argument as it\nstands, but requires somehow reframing it. This is not the same thing as arguing within\none among already-evident paradigms. Rather, it is an exercise in rhetorical invention,\nfinding a new way to think about a subject that the disputants have not recognized but\nmight find persuasive in a given case. Although this operation is rhetorical, it is hardly\nnon-rational. It has an underlying logic that can be explicated. The rhetorical critic may\nbe able to resolve what for the disputants is deep disagreement because the critic can\nimagine possibilities that the disputants cannot.\nZarefsky (2012b, 2012c) identified and examined four pairs of rhetorical moves\nillustrating the potential for transcending an argumentative impasse. One pair relates to\ninconsistency: charging the opponent with hypocrisy or employing the circumstantial ad\nhominem to show that the interlocutor\u2019s own situation is at odds with his or her\ncommitments. Another pair involved packaging the argument: breaking the impasse by\nincorporating one of the competing positions into a larger package and subsuming both of\nthe competing approaches under a larger category that they presumably share. A third\npair of argumentative approaches concerned the treatment of time: holding that the\nexhaustion of the interlocutors made the stakes less important, creating the desire for a\nsettlement, or holding that the urgency of the situation precludes extended disputation\nand requires the selection of some option, even though sub-optimal, that everyone could\nlive with. The final pair of approaches involve changing the ground of the controversy:\ninterfield borrowing, making arguments in one field through the language or conventions\nof another in order to moot the question of what field the argument is in, and frame-\nshifting, such that the argument comes to be viewed from a different frame of reference.\nThese approaches are promising and suggestive of the potential for rhetorical\nmoves to resolve an argumentative impasse. But implementing them is difficult. Many\ndepend for their strength on shared conditions among the disputants. For example,\nexhaustion will work as a way to break an impasse only if arguers on both sides are\nequally exhausted. If one party is exhausted and the other is gearing up for a long fight, it\nis most unlikely that appealing to the feeling of exhaustion will lead to transcendent\nmoves. Likewise, in an interfield dispute, if one party is willing to embrace the other\u2019s\nterminology and assumptions but the second party resists any effort at ecumenicalism,\n15 then nothing will happen. More generally, it is probably the case that any unilateral effort\nto overcome deep disagreement is unlikely to work. Although it is possible to imagine a\nsituation in which one party might be seduced by the other into getting beyond an\nimpasse, it seems more likely that the arguer who does not mind being in an impasse can\nmaintain that condition, all the while using his or her intransigence to argue that the other\nparty has not succeeded in overcoming the impasse.\n6. Critical questions\nA more systematic treatment following the lines suggested here would flesh out a\nwide range of examples, see how they fit the patterns identified here, and explicate their\ndynamics. The underlying assumption of the project is that the discovery of\nincommensurable positions does not bring analysis to an end or require the substitution of\n\u201cnon-rational\u201d means of persuasion. Nor can we rest in the misplaced confidence that\ncases of deep disagreement are rare and relatively inconsequential. Rather, when\nconfronted with what appears to be deep disagreement, we need to ask a series of\nquestions:\n(1) Is this controversy easy to resolve without imagining it as a case of deep\ndisagreement?\n(2) What are the consequences of conceiving of this controversy as deep\ndisagreement rather than just as intense conflict, pigheadedness, etc.?\n(3) What happens if the argument remains in an impasse, and what happens if the\nimpasse can be overcome?\n(4) Which of these or other possible approaches might be available to get beyond the\nimpasse, and what are the merits and drawbacks of each?\n(5) Finally, what approach should be recommended to the arguers and what approach\nshould serve as a touchstone for critical appraisal?\nWe have far to go in really understanding what Fogelin offhandedly called \u201cthe logic of\ndeep disagreement,\u201d but an approach along the lines suggested in this essay is at least a\nway to start.\nReferences\nAdams, D.M.

Hansen\nUniversity of Windsor\nhhansen@uwindsor.ca\nAbstract: Starting from the observation that argumentation studies have low recognition value\nboth within and without the academy, and mindful of the current desiderata that academic\nresearch should be relevant outside the academy, I introduce the concept of an argumentation\nprofile as a panacea for our ills. Argumentation profiles are sketches of the argumentation\nbehaviour of either individuals or groups (such as political parties) and are based on concepts\nunique to argumentation studies such as argumentation schemes, dialogical roles and\nresponsiveness. It is argued that argumentation profiles would be of interest to voters as well as\npolitical parties.\nKey words: value of argumentation, argumentation agent, argumentation profile, argumentation\nschemes, dialogical roles\nWe who work in the field of argumentation studies think our subject is\nimportant and that it should be recognized as important not only by our fellow\ncultural workers by also by the broader public. Yet recognition of the value of our\nchosen field is slow in coming. Accordingly, I want to begin by posing a question that\nmay seem rather rude, or at any rate, altogether too direct in the present volume: What is\nthe justification for argumentation studies? What value does it have? I think we may look\nto three different kinds of justification, which may be distinguished as the intra-\ndisciplinary, inter-disciplinary and social justifications of argumentation studies. It is the\nlast one \u2013 the social source of justification \u2013 that is especially pressing these days.\n1. The value of research within the academy\nThe intra-disciplinary justification of any field of knowledge is the growth of knowledge\nin that field. It is the appetite for more knowledge that drives the researcher in any discipline to\nlearn more, to explore alternatives, and to refine methodology. Most of the efforts taking place at\nargumentation conferences are about expanding, organizing and re-organizing what we know\nabout the field or discipline we call argumentation studies. There are friendly rivalries within the\nfield \u2013 uncertainties or disagreements to be overcome that give impetus to further research. In all\nthe arts and humanities we dare to hope that there may be a social benefit of the knowledge we\naccrue, but we are not sure what precisely that benefit is, or whether there always is one. At any\nrate, from the intra-disciplinary point of view, it is not the thought of the influence on society\nthat spurs us on, but rather our desire to know more and to know better.\nA further value or justification of disciplinary knowledge is when it interacts with or\ncombines with other disciplinary knowledge. Intellectual history is replete with examples of how\ntwo distinct fields or academic subjects have profitably combined to make a new field: most\n* An earlier version of this paper has appeared in Cogency: Journal of Reasoning & Argumentation,\n2015, 7 (1): 29-46.\n18 famously, Descartes\u2019 combination of algebra and geometry to make analytic geometry. More\nrecently biology and chemistry have combined to make biochemistry, and biology and\ngeography have combined to make biogeography; mathematics, physics and aesthetics combine\nto make engineering and architecture. In each of these cases the combined intellectual product\n(knowledge) is something that neither contributing discipline could have achieved on its own.\nThe value of such mixed-marriages is well recognized, and is now being actively encouraged at\neducational institutions in North America under the banners \u2013 as I understand them \u2013 of inter-\ndisciplinarity (combining research methods to provide new perspectives on familiar fields) and\ntrans-disciplinarity (transcending traditional disciplinary methodologies to create new research\nfields).\nArgumentation studies is itself an amalgamated discipline, consisting at least of some\nlogic, some rhetorical theory, and some dialectical theory, but it can also contribute to\ninterdisciplinary research. I have tried some interdisciplinary work with Jane McLeod, an\nhistorian. We studied the kinds of arguments made by those who petitioned for printer\u2019s licenses\nin provincial eighteenth-century France. (See Hansen and McLeod, 2012; McLeod and Hansen,\n2005). However, the value of these kinds of interdisciplinary ventures is still measured by their\neffect within the academy and its environs. They are extensions of established research\ntechniques and are motivated by the same values that drive intra-disciplinary research: to know\nmore and to know better.\n2. Does the study of argumentation have a social value?\nSo far we have been concerned with the intra-mural or academic justification of\nargumentation research in the academy, within knowledge-seeking communities. We should now\nmove to the next question: what payoff does argumentation studies have for the larger public, for\nall those outside the academy? How does or can our research benefit them?\nThis is not an untimely question. In the United Kingdom the way researchers go about\ntheir work is about to change, writes Andy Miah. The framework used \u201cfor assessing the value of\nresearch will now include a new component called \u2018impact\u2019, which requires professors to show\nhow their research makes a direct contribution to society beyond academia\u201d (Miah 2012: 12).\nThere is thus \u201cthe expectation for researchers to have a presence beyond academia.\u201d\nIf you are applying for a research grant from Social Sciences and Humanities Research\nCouncil of Canada (SSHRCC \u2013 one of the main funders of academic research in Canada) then,\nunder the heading of \u201cSummary of Proposed Research,\u201d you are asked to indicate \u201cthe potential\ncontribution of the research both in terms of the advancement of knowledge, and of the wider\nsocial benefit, etc.\u201d (emphasis added). At the University of Windsor, the strategic plan outlining\nour goals for the next few years, requires that we \u201cfoster research excellence and the greatest\nsocietal impact of research and creative activity through the encouragement of intra- and inter-\ndisciplinary research (. . .)\u201d (University of Windsor, 2012). Here again the emphasis is on\nsocietal impact of research. We then must ask, what is the social impact of argumentation\nstudies? What direct contribution to society beyond academia does argumentation studies make?\nWhat is the wider social benefit of our work?\nThis is a fair question to ask. Obviously, research in the sciences upon which medicine\nrests has great social benefits in lessening suffering and increasing health. Environmental science\ngives us the means to manage our planet and its resources in a sustainable way (if only the public\nwould appreciate them). Research in sociology and anthropology enables us to act constructively\nin lessening conflict and disruption when cultures come into conflict. Research in logic and\n19 mathematics has contributed to the development of computers, which, as we know, has affected\nsociety, immeasurably. How then does the study of argumentation serve society outside the walls\nof the university? How does it serve those who do not have an interest in the pursuit of\nknowledge for its own sake?\nI have no doubts about the value of argumentation studies for the general public. In\nteaching the values and techniques of good argumentation we benefit individual men and women\ndirectly, and hence society indirectly. Johnson and Blair describe the benefit rather broadly as\nmaking us more discriminating consumers of all the arguments that face us in our daily lives,\nincluding those about what to buy, where to live, and whom to marry (Johnson and Blair, 1983:\nxiii). Thomas Hollihan, in his keynote address at the 2011 Alta Conference on Argumentation,\nidentifies a narrower aim: \u201cBy properly educating arguers our field claimed it could change the\ncharacter of deliberative argument and help democratic reasoning flourish\u201d (Hollihan, 2011: 8).\nWhat greater boon could an academic discipline bestow on society?\nDespite our lofty goals and good intentions, however, we are faced with two important\nchallenges. The one is admitted by Hollihan: \u201cThere is little evidence that our persistent\nadmonitions about the appropriate conduct and character of public argument have impacted\narguers\u2019 behaviour, at least in the political sphere\u201d (Hollihan, 2011: 9). We do not have much to\nshow for our efforts so far, despite our idealism and hard work.\nThe second challenge is that the unique contribution of argumentation studies does not\nstand out distinctly in the public\u2019s mind. Even within the academy, we may not be thought of as\nbeing particularly unique. The skills and values that we champion in argumentation studies are\nincorporated to a significant degree in the teaching of other subjects as well. Historians teach\ncritical thinking about the evidentiary import of documents; scientists instill the rigorous\nmethods of scientific inquiry in their students; professors of politics teach caution in the analysis\nof political events and platforms; philosophers study and criticize the values and means of\ndeliberative democracy; departments of English teach argumentative writing and analysis; law\nschools train their students in the art of dialectical argumentation. This ubiquitous usurpation of\nour subject matter is cause for celebration since it shows how pervasive our specialty is; on the\nother hand, it is cause for despair because the general public outside the academy cannot\ndistinguish our contribution to good argumentation practices from that of other disciplines that\nhave higher recognition value: history, physics, chemistry, political studies, English, and law.\nEven in the minds of many of those within the academy our specialty \u2013 argumentation studies \u2013\ndoes not stand out in sharp relief. If our concern is to justify argumentation studies by its impact\non society outside the academy (as well as within it), then, it appears that we have a public\nrelations problem. We need to increase our visibility.\nHollihan makes five suggestions about how \u201cwe might increase the impact of our\nacademic scholarship, our values, and our pedagogy on contemporary argument practices and on\nour standing in the academy and the broader community\u201d (5, emphasis added). Among his\nsuggestions are that we should \u201cincrease the impact of our discipline within the academy by\nfocusing on our connections to other academic disciplines\u201d (18); that we should examine the\nimplications of new communication technology; that we should investigate the neurosciences;\nand that we should reinvigorate argumentation pedagogy. But most importantly, for present\nconsiderations, is what Hollihan says about our public role:\n[W]e need to significantly increase the public profile of our discipline. . . . Scholars of\nargumentation need to be more forthright in commenting in praise and in blame about the\ndiscourse surrounding us, and we need to do so not only in academic journals and\n20 conference presentations but also in public media. . . . Our scholarship should be more\novertly practical and engaged (Hollihan, 2011: 16-17, emphasis added).\nHere again, I am happy to follow Hollihan \u2013 but only part of the way.\n3. Argumentation Profiles\nMy suggestion is that we make a unique and identifiable contribution to society by the\ndevelopment of what may (tentatively) be called argumentation profiles. By an \u2018argumentation\nprofile\u2019 I mean a description or characterization of argumentation behaviour over time as\nexhibited by an argumentation agent. By an \u2018argumentation agent\u2019 I mean an individual, group,\nparty, or collective that makes and takes responsibility for arguments.\nHow can argumentation profiles be of social value? Argumentation-behaviour is\nimportant for democracy; we want to elect people who will not only argue well, but also argue\nopenly, fairly, and productively. Past argumentation-behaviour encapsulated in an argumentation\nprofile may be considered a predictor of future argumentation-behaviour, much as past moral and\nprudential behaviour is considered an index of future moral and prudential behaviour.\nArgumentation profiles may also be a window through which we can come to understand\nan argument agent\u2019s true political attitudes. Richard Weaver, in his 1952 work, The Ethics of\nRhetoric, wrote that \u201c[a] reasoner reveals his philosophical position by the source of arguments\nwhich appears most often in his major premise because the major premise tells us how he is\nthinking about the world\u201d (55) and that \u201ca man\u2019s method of argument is a truer index in his\nbeliefs than is an explicit profession of principles\u201d (58). In other words, we can learn something\nabout a person\u2019s political beliefs and deep-seated attitudes by looking at the record of his or her\nargumentation.\nWeaver maintained that the eighteenth century political theorist, Edmund Burke, whom\nwe recall as a conservative, mostly used the argument from circumstance in his speeches and\nwritings, a kind of argument more appropriate to expediency and liberal politics than to\nconservatism. In contrast he associates the argument from genus with Abraham Lincoln, a kind\nof argument usually associated with conservatism and the status quo; yet Lincoln is cherished as\na pragmatic and liberal politician.\nSo, what we may take from Weaver is that the arguments agents make tell us something\nimportant, perhaps revealing and surprising about that agent. Weaver\u2019s insight can be extended\nby taking political parties as subjects, not just individuals, and by expanding the number of\nindexes (beyond major premises) that can contribute to characterizations of argument agents \u2013 to\nprofiles. The work attempted so far focuses on the profiles that can be made of agents engaged in\npolitical argumentation, but profiles could also be made of argumentation agents in other fields\nlike science, law, and religion.\nElaine Cassel has \u2018profiled\u2019 the argumentation behaviour of members of the United States\nSupreme Court during the recent hearings about Obama-care. She found, through looking at their\nargumentation behaviour, that some of the judges showed empathy and compassion for poor\npeople, some were of even temperament, some showed an authoritarian approach to legislation,\nsome kept their politics out of their argumentation and stuck to legal arguments, some remained\naloof from the fray. Cassel claims to have learned something about the judges by studying their\nargumentation (Cassel, 2012).\nSome people have identified a male way of conducting argumentation, and found it\nobjectionable. A generalization about the way men argue is implicitly a rough argumentation\nprofile of men. That there are such generalizations is an indication that there is a coarse, or\n21 intuitive, idea of argumentation profiles already at large. The present proposal aims to give shape\nand character to such profiles.\nA notable aspect of argumentation profiles is that they do not characterize argument\nagents on the basis of isolated episodes of argumentation behaviour \u2013 a particularly ingenious\nanalogy, or an atrocious fallacy, for examples \u2013 but on their argumentation behaviour over an\nextended period of time. Thus, the import of profiles is that they will indicate how agents have\nbeen disposed to engage in argumentation in the past, and how they may be inclined to argue in\nthe future.\n4. Concepts Put to Work\nAn argumentation profile of an argument agent should be based on an analysis of the\nagent\u2019s argumentation-behaviour over a period of time and constructed from the concepts unique\nto the study of argumentation. Thus, when making profiles of argumentation behaviour in\npolitical contexts it is not the usual issue-oriented categories we need such as views on the\neconomy, education, energy, the environment, and health care. The concepts needed for\nargumentation profiles will be quite different. They do not have to do with policies or platforms,\nor party philosophies. Which concepts in particular will be useful for making profiles is\nsomething we will have to find out through experimentation, but it is reasonable to begin by\nutilizing some of the concepts argumentation workers already have to hand.\nDoug Walton and I have finished one pilot study of the argumentation in political\ncampaigns, and we are now engaged in a second one. We studied the Ontario provincial election\nheld in September-October 2011 (see Hansen and Walton, 2012; Hansen and Walton, 2013) and\nhave finished gathering data on the provincial election held in Alberta, March-April, 2012. For\nthe Alberta election we have about 600 newspaper reports to consider; we hope to complete the\nanalysis sometime in the future. Our work is similar to that of William Benoit who has studied\nthe argumentation in the nomination acceptance speeches by presidential candidates in the\nUnited States from 1960 to 1996. In one of his studies, Benoit recognized three basic functions in\nthe speeches, distinguished as acclaiming, attacking and defending:\nThemes that portray the sponsoring candidate or party in a favorable light are acclaims.\nThemes that portray the opposing candidate or party in an unfavorable light are attacks.\nThemes that explicitly respond to a prior attack on the candidate or party are defenses\n(Benoit 1999: 254).\nBenoit\u2019s leading research question was, \u201cWhat is the relative frequency of use of the functions of\nacclaiming, attacking and defending?\u201d (253). He found that the Democratic Party nominees\nengaged in acclaiming slightly more than the Republican party nominee did (77% to 68%) but\nthat the roles were reversed when it came to attacking (30% to 23%) as well as defending (16%\nto 3%). Clearly, Benoit\u2019s interests and approach are consonant with our programme of creating\nargumentation profiles by studying the argumentation behaviour of argument agents. Our\napproach differs from his, however, in that we focus on arguments as the basic unit of interest,\nand we consider more indexes of argumentation behavior than he does.\nIn our first study, Walton and I sketched profiles on the basis of which kinds of\narguments and dialectical roles were utilized most frequently by the agents. In our second study\nwe are modifying and enlarging our inventory of argument kinds and roles, and adding some\nother categories whose utility we want to test. We are experimenting to find out which factors\nand categories can contribute to the making of useful argumentation profiles. The following list\n22 of concepts is being considered:\n1. Argument kinds: The primary classification tool we have is a list of kinds of arguments, also\ncalled argument schemes. The schemes are, roughly, definitions of different kinds of arguments,\nsorted on the basis of the kinds of reasons being brought to bear on a conclusion. A\ncomprehensive list of the kinds of arguments that occur in political argumentation will help\nshape a picture of an agent\u2019s inclinations in argumentation. In our first study we used the basic\ninventory of schemes identified in Walton\u2019s Fundamentals of Critical Argumentation. For the\nsecond study, which is of the provincial election held in Alberta in March-April 2012 we will\nemploy the following list of schemes:\n(1) argument from position to know; (2) argument from appeal to expert opinion; (3)\nargument from general acceptance; (4) argument from lack of knowledge; (5) argument\nfrom consistent commitment; (6) argument from inconsistent commitments; (7) argument\nfrom character (ad hominem); (8) argument from positive consequences; (9) argument\nfrom negative consequences; (10) argument practical reasoning \u2013 recommending/\njustifying course of action; (11) argument from misplaced priorities; (12) argument from\nanalogy; (13) argument from sign; (14) argument from distinction / classification; (15)\nargument from correlation to cause.\nIn constructing argumentation profiles, one looks to see which kinds of arguments are\npreferred by the argument agent. A key methodological question for us is, what is the optimal list\nof argument schemes that should be used for making argumentation profiles of agents engaged in\npolitical argumentation?\n2. Pragma-dialectical argumentation schemes: It is also possible to classify arguments broadly\non the basis of the kind of conduit they provide from premises to conclusions. Pragma-dialectical\ntheory offers a three-fold classification in this category: symptomatic argumentation,\ninstrumental argumentation, and similarity argumentation (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 1992:\n94 ff.). Even though there are only three \u2018schemes\u2019 here they have the advantage that they are\nmutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive, or at least appear to be so. (The same cannot be said\nfor the informal logic schemes; with them it is possible that an argument could instance two or\nmore schemes, and then a decision has to be made about which scheme is the best fit for the\nargument.) However, because there are only three schemes in this typology, we can expect only\nvery general information to come from this classification. But, as before, one is curious to see if\nan argument agent prefers one kind of scheme to the others.\n3. Aristotle\u2019s pisteis: Aristotle\u2019s three artificial means of persuasion might also give us some\ninsight into the argumentation proclivities of agents (See Rhet. 1356a). We will supplement the\nargumentation profiles by classifying arguments on the basis of whether it is logos (evidence),\nethos (character) or pathos (emotion) that is brought to bear.\nThese first three categories of classification (kinds, schemes, pisteis) have to do with non-\nrelational aspects of the arguments themselves \u2013 they are ways of classifying either the kind of\nreasons brought to bear, or the way that the reasons are related to the conclusion. It is also\npossible to study the external (relational) properties of arguments in an ongoing political\ndiscussion, in particular to consider the roles, or functions, of the arguments in the ongoing\ndiscussions.\n4. Dialectical roles: Argument agents have purposes they want to achieve by the use of their\narguments and thus the arguments are instrumental to their ends. Hence, given a context like that\n23 of a provincial or national election, arguments may be seen as being used for certain purposes by\nthe agents in the argument exchanges. There is no determinate list of ends that arguers have in\nusing arguments, and so no definitive catalogue of roles that can be determined. Walton and I felt\nfree to invent a short list of four dialectical roles, which we noticed recurring in the data of\npolitical campaign arguments. These were the policy-positive role (used to defend a statement or\npolicy), the policy-critical role (used to criticize a statement or policy), the person-critical role\n(used to criticize an opponent rather than his/her position), and the defensive role (used to deflect\ncriticisms). After reading Benoit (op. cit.) we added a fifth by dividing his category of\nacclaiming into positive and negative roles, allowing us to add a person-positive role.\nStudying an argument agent\u2019s choice of roles will tell us something not only of his/her/\nits resources, but also about the possibilities it sees for advancing its cause. The analysis of\ndialectical roles must, however, be tempered by the following two dialogical considerations.\n5. Dialogical roles: Is an argument being used to initiate discussion of an issue, or is it a\nresponse-argument, made as a reply or alternative to an argument or policy already before the\npublic? My hunch is that response arguments are more likely to be cast in a negative role than\narguments that introduce a new topic or policy. But it is not impossible that a response argument\nhas a positive role or that an initiating argument has a negative one. This is a factor to take into\nconsideration when constructing argumentation profiles.\n6. Dialogical position: Whether an argument agent is the incumbent party or a challenger\nestablishes his/her/its dialogical position, something which may well affect the choice of\ndialectical roles an agent gives to arguments. My inkling is that an incumbent party is more\nlikely to have occasion to use the defensive role, clarifying misinterpretations, and defending\npolicies. Challengers we would expect to be on the attack, being critical of both policies and\nincumbents. Of course, both sides will likely make arguments in all the roles, but certain roles\nmay predominate for an agent during the course of a campaign. In sum, in constructing the\nargumentation profiles, both the dialogical positions of the agents, and the dialogical roles of\ntheir arguments, must be taken into consideration.\nThe above concepts are suggested as being of value to argumentation workers who\nattempt to make argumentation profiles. Additions, deletions and refinements, are solicited.\n5. Illustration\nSuppose we obtained the following result for three parties during an election campaign:\nPriority rankings Party A Party B Party C\nArgument kinds Practical reasoning, positive Negative consequences; Fairness; Analogy;\nSympathy\nconsequences; fairness direct ad hominem;\nmisplaced priorities\n24 PD schemes instrumental symptomatic similarity\nPisteis ethos logos pathos\nDialectical role policy +; person +; defensivep erson \u2013 ; policy +; policy +; person \u2013;\npolicy \u2013 person +\nDialogical role response; initiator initiator; response initiator; response\nDialogical position incumbent challenger challenger\nWhat might we say about these results? We might venture these thumbnail sketches:\nParty A: Problem-solution oriented but balanced with considerations of fairness; depends on\ncredibility of agent; stresses the advantages of own policies and leadership; corrects\nmisinterpretations and deflects criticism.\nParty B: Depicts incumbent party as having bad policies, and attacks character of its members;\nwants to establish alternative goals; sees policies of government as indication of corruption;\nappeals to statistics and public opinion; puts priority on criticizing opponents over promoting\nown policies; initiates lines of discussion (criticism) more so than responding to the ideas of\nothers, indicating an attempt to control the discussion.\nParty C: Primarily concerned with social justice; makes case by drawing comparisons to other\nmore vivid injustices; appeals to sympathy of electorate; initiates lines of argument stressing\nvalue of its own policies and is somewhat critical of incumbent and other opponent; tries to\nchange agenda to discuss its own issues; depicts itself as having a high moral character.\nNotice that these argumentation profiles are descriptive, not evaluative. Some\nargumentation workers would go further and, from a distant point of view, evaluate the\narguments and argumentation of each of the agents, and thus make evaluative argumentation\nprofiles of agents. Christian Kock (2011), for example, urges that the argumentation of\npoliticians should be evaluated from the point of view of whether it meets the needs of the voting\npublic in its quest to make an informed decision at the ballot box (14). And Hollihan (2011), as\nwe saw, suggested that we should be more visible \u201cin commenting in praise and in blame\nabout the discourse surrounding us,\u201d especially in public media. Certainly, those who are good\nat evaluating argumentation should further benefit the political process by entering the\nfray with their findings. But what is being promoted in this essay is the construction of\nprofiles, not the evaluation of arguments. These are different endeavours and although\nthey are related, they put argumentation workers in different roles: creating profiles is\nlargely empirical work; moreover, although it is not yet wholly clear what evaluating\nprofiles might entail, it will primarily be the evaluation of argument agents, not arguments.\n25 There are different ways of engaging the public and stimulating the democratic process.\nThe publication of the evaluation of political argumentation requires a different skill set\nthan does profiling and a wide acquaintance with historical, cultural and politically relevant\nfacts. Argumentation profiling is not meant to compete with argumentation evaluation but\nrather to offer another a way of learning about political agents. Political discourse is\nalready heavy on argued opinions advising people what to believe and how to vote. The\nsuggestion here is that we prime the public\u2019s interest in the democratic process by\npresenting it with findings about argument agents that citizens can use in their own\ncontemplation and decision making.\n6. Social Justification / Impact\nThe problem taken up in this paper is whether the study of argumentation can be justified\nby its impact on society. In order to be validated in society\u2019s eyes, argumentation studies will\nhave to become more visible as a socially useful field, and one way it might do this, I am\nsuggesting, is by doing something no one else can do \u2013 to wit, create argumentation profiles of\nargumentation agents whose behaviour is of interest and importance to society. Some of the\nconcepts that could be the building blocks of such profiles have been suggested, but the\ndevelopment of this project is still in its early stages. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that the\ndevelopment of argumentation profiles can have an impact on society.\nA. Value to voters. Voters will want to take profiles into consideration when preparing to vote:\nnot only do we want to support politicians who advocate policies we approve of, we also want to\nelect people who will conduct themselves in an intellectually capable and responsibly manner, if\nthey are elected. Traits relevant to these values can be captured in argumentation profiles and be\nindicators of future argumentation behaviour.\nB. Value to the media. Voters will find out about argumentation profiles through the traditional\nnews media and the Internet. Profiles of parties (or individual politicians) can be tailored for\nconsumption in the public media, e.g., newspapers, radio, television, blogs, etc., either during a\ncampaign or shortly afterwards, as long as public interest endures. Walton and I have done this\n(Hansen and Walton, 2012). In general the media will welcome this new and different kind of\nanalysis of political behaviour. However, if the findings are to be of value to the larger public\nthen they should be presented in categories understood by the general public. Most people do not\ncare to distinguish three kinds of ad hominem arguments or two kinds of slippery slopes. In\ngeneral, technical language and stipulative definitions should be avoided. Thus the categories\nand language used for making argumentation profiles and discussing them with colleagues will\nnot be the same as the categories and language used for reporting the profiles to the general\npublic.\nC. Value to political parties. Citizens, media and politicians exist in a symbiotic relationship:\nthey all need each other. Political parties will be interested in their own argumentation profiles as\nthey appear in the media, as well as those of their opponents. This is so especially to the extent\nthat the public takes the view that it wants its politicians to behave in an intellectually\nresponsible manner. Both individual politicians and their parties will want to know how they can\nimprove their own profiles and how they can take advantage of their opponents\u2019 weaknesses as\nrevealed in their profiles. There is thus a possibility of argumentation specialists working with\n26 argumentation agents in private-public co-operative ventures.\n7. Externalities\nThere are, in addition, a number of spin-offs, or externalities, of doing argumentation\nprofiles that can be felt within the academy; that is, there are intra- and inter-disciplinary payoffs\nin our attempt to serve the extra-mural community.\nD. Concept testing. Argumentation studies will gain some intra-disciplinary benefit from the\npursuit of argumentation profiles. An example of this lies in the development of the informal-\nlogic argument schemes. Whereas textbooks look for arguments they can use to illustrate\nschemes, we look for a list of schemes that will be adequate to the identification and\nclassification of all the arguments in a given field of discourse. What is optimal here? We need a\nbalance between what is informative and manageable. Our work in this direction can lead to\ntextbooks that are a better fit with the argumentation reality for which they wish to offer\nguidance. This means that we must renew our efforts to develop a list of argument kinds\n(schemes) that will be comprehensive enough to allow classification of all the arguments found\nin the discourse, but which is not so fine-grained that it introduces minute distinctions that have\nlittle or no consequence for the making of argumentation profiles.\nE. Inter-disciplinary cooperation. Argumentation workers need the cooperation of at least three\nother fields in order to make argumentation profiles sound and valuable. (1) The profiles will be\ngiven greater content by incorporating other rhetorical factors which contribute to the character\nof argumentation behaviour; for example, choice of language, responsibility with regard to the\nburden of proof, etc.; hence, coordination with communication workers with complementary\ninterests will make the argumentation profiles more complete. (2) One of the research questions\nthat we are faced with is what to make of the patterns of argumentation behaviour once they have\nbeen identified. Our analyses can be enriched by the cooperation and participation of social\npsychologists, people who study personality, group behaviour, and social cognition. (3) Creating\nprofile of political behaviour invites participation and cooperation with colleagues in political\nstudies. They can give context and analysis of political argumentation that lies beyond the reach\nof the argumentation specialist qua argumentation specialist. We should engage the collaboration\nof workers from these other disciplines, thus creating a new inter-disciplinary research project,\none that can be justified in terms of the public interest and benefit. But we should always keep\nthe argumentation concepts as the key elements of argumentation profiles, as the central,\nunifying components.\nF. Student participation. Training students is a necessary condition, in many cases, of getting\nresearch grants. Student participation in gathering, classifying and analysing the arguments used\nin the creation of the profiles not only has the benefit that it trains them in their field and in\nresearch, in the case of argumentation profiles of political argumentation agents it may also\nstimulate their interest in civic issues and good argumentation. An additional value in having\nstudents involved is that it forces us to clarify concepts and methods from the researchers\u2019 side\n(in addition to the audience side, as above), so that our conceptual tools become functionally\nadequate. If these instruments cannot be used by university students at the upper undergraduate\nlevel, or the beginning graduate level, then we have lost sight of an important goal of informal\nlogic viz., to provide tools of analysis and evaluation useful to the public in general. In gathering\nthe information needed for making the profiles, we can observe how well our students do with\n27 the materials we provide for them to work with, and make adjustments as needed.\nThis completes my case for seeking the involvement of fellow argumentation workers in\nthe study of political campaigns, and the value of making argumentation profiles.\nReferences\nAristotle.

Dialogue\nThe whole of this volume is concerned with dialogue \u2013 why it falters, when\narguers can reconcile, and how partisans can be constrained by the institutions they\ninhabit (see Von Burg\u2019s introductory chapter). For the most part \u201cdialogue\u201d is not being\nunderstood very technically in this book, and mainly just refers to (the possibility of) two\nparties presenting their cases, listening open-mindedly, and responding intelligently to\none another. Very little perceptiveness, either personal or political, is required to notice\nthat this doesn\u2019t seem to happen very often, or at least as often as we might like. Other\ncontributors to this volume have proposed explanations for these failures: values may be\nincommensurable, people may be cynical about the credibility of those agencies that are\nsupposed to be providing facts to contemplate, arguers may listen in a closed-minded\nway, spokespersons may not be free to express anything except a \u201cparty line,\u201d or the\nmedia and internet may bury good information in bad.\nMost of those papers are oriented to the public sphere, and therefore to public\nactors. Such people may be speaking for themselves, but they are also constrained to\nspeak for others at the same time: for their nation, their party, their judicial faction, one of\ntheir identities, and so forth. This is the circumstance that brings institutional constraint\ninto play. Various dichotomous outcomes \u2013 win or lose an election, pass or fail a piece of\nlegislation, legalize or criminalize a particular behavior \u2013 all impose unfitting simplicities\non matters that are really more nuanced. Readers will no doubt discover how interesting\nit is to watch those other authors work through all these complexities and simultaneous\nvoices.\nHere, however, people were left in their ordinary lives. Although they were asked\nto pretend to be US senators for the purposes of the experiment (because we wanted them\nto act seriously), they were truly undergraduates and they certainly understood that.\nTheir responsibilities for what they said evaporated the moment they finished the\nexperiment, and of course they were aware of that as well. The constraints,\nresponsibilities, and answerabilities that complicate public actors and their arguments\n29 were minimized here. We wanted to see how simple face-to-face dialogues handled a\nparticular kind of argument, the analogy.\n2. Analogies\nArgument from analogy is a commonly recognized argument scheme. Perelman\nand Olbrechts-Tyteca (1969: 372-373) give the base form of the argument as being \u201cA is\nto B as C is to D.\u201d The relationships are compared, not the individual terms. That is, the\nA/B relationship is held out as similar to the C/D relationship. So for example: fried\nchicken is as American as goulash is Hungarian. This analogy would serve as support for\na conclusion such as, we should regard fried chicken as representative of American\nculture, thereby forming an argument from analogy. The analogy does not depend on\nfried chicken being like goulash or America being like Hungary: only the relationships\nbetween terms are important.\nArguments from analogy have an uncertain status and a rocky history in\nargumentation studies. Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca (1969), for instance, consider that\nanalogy should be \u201cviewed with distrust when used as a means of proof\u201d (372). Walton,\nReed, and Macagno (2008: ch. 2; cf. Bermejo-Luque, 2012; Botting, 2012) nicely review\na number of controversies about analogies: Are they legitimate argument schemes or\ninevitably a kind of fallacy? Are they construable as deductive, inductive, or neither? Can\nthey prove a conclusion or only suggest one? At their best, do they offer rational support\nor only persuasion? Walton et al. (2008) offer this overall judgment: \u201cargument from\nanalogy is best seen as a defeasible argumentation scheme that is inherently weak and\nsubject to failure, but that can still be reasonable if used properly to support a conclusion\u201d\n(61). Evaluation of an analogy, they suggest, should take place in the context of a pointed\ndialogue between two arguers.\nThis project, which does in fact expose analogies to dialogue, is part of a series of\nstudies examining how serious conversation deals with defeasible arguments (Hample,\nJones, & Averbeck, 2009; Hample, 2011a, 2011b). The motivating idea behind this work\nwas the hypothesis that focused conversation is the engine of rationality. That is,\nintelligent give and take was expected to set fallacies aside and give weak arguments no\nmore weight than they deserved. The first study (Hample, Jones, & Averbeck, 2009)\nexplored how conversants dealt with several different fallacies, and concluded that people\nwere appropriately critical and reserved about them. The other two studies explored the\npossibility that individually weak arguments might cumulate into stronger overall\narguments. Both weak causal arguments (Hample, 2011a) and examples (Hample, 2011b)\nevoked this sort of reaction from arguers. In other words, weak causal arguments and\nexamples were found to be conductive (convergent), so that a conclusion that would be\nindifferently supported by a single argument was better received when supported by\nseveral (cf. Snoeck Henkemans, 2000; Wellman, 1971).\nThe evidence for that finding was this. Confederates were trained to insert a\nnumber of poor (but not valueless) arguments into conversations, and we coded\nparticipants\u2019 reactions to them. We found that people were expectably critical of the first\nsuch argument, but their opposition to the arguments diminished as they were exposed to\nmore and more of them. Thus the individual arguments could only be collectively\nsufficient, and as the argument dialogue began to approach that point people were more\nopen to additional flawed arguments.\n30 One objection to this interpretation is that perhaps the arguers were simply worn\ndown by more and more arguments needing answers or evaluations. Instead of seeing a\nproper reaction to converging proofs, perhaps we only saw growing fatigue or disinterest.\nBecause of their potentially indifferent quality as arguments, analogies may not\nhave the same conductive character as examples or weak causal arguments. The key to\nthe convergence interpretation is the idea that although one example was a weak support\nfor a national policy, it was not entirely valueless and did in fact afford proof for one\nsmall bit of the nation. So as examples piled up, one got closer to a legitimate induction.\nA similar explanation was offered for the idea that mediocre causal arguments might\ncumulate.\nHowever, it is not at all clear that we should expect analogies to be collectively\nconductive. Examples might cumulate into an induction and varieties of correlational\nevidence might finally make a causal conclusion more appropriate. But being like cats\ndoesn\u2019t seem to add much to being like rust protection for a car (to mention two of the\nanalogies used in this study). So if we see increasing acceptance as people are exposed to\nmore and more analogies, the \u2018wearing them down\u2019 explanation for the earlier results will\nbe more compelling. On the other hand, if reactions to analogies remain essentially the\nsame during an extended period of analogical reasoning, this would highlight the\nconductive character of the arguments used in earlier studies and tell us something\nimportant about analogies, namely that they do not converge. It would also indicate that\n5-minute conversations are not long enough to wear out interactants. This study is\ndesigned to see whether analogies converge on a conclusion or do not. Either result will\nput us in a much better position to understand the results of the earlier studies. And of\ncourse we will also have learned something new about analogies.\n3. Method\nThe procedure consisted of having people engage in conversations concerning\ngun control in the United States. Participants were given a consent form and a brief\nsurvey that collected demographic information and pretest attitudes. They were instructed\nthat they would be role-playing a U.S. senator and would be having a discussion with\nanother student, who was also role-playing a U.S. senator. In fact, the other participant\nwas an experimental confederate, who had been trained to insert analogies into the\ndiscussion. The confederates were also undergraduates.\nConfederates were each assigned two analogies to insert first into the\nconversations to ensure that at least initially all the analogies were used with equal\nfrequency. Analogies used in the study are in Table 1. They are what Govier (1989)\nclassed as a priori analogies, as distinguished from inductive ones. Inductive or empirical\nanalogies (e.g., We did it successfully in Chicago, so it will be successful in Detroit) are\nmuch more like the examples studied in Hample (2011b). Similarities between arguments\nfrom example and analogy are discussed elsewhere (Hample, 2012).\nTable 1\nAnalogies Embedded into Conversations by Experimental Confederates\nTaking guns away from citizens is like declawing a cat. It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re going to keep\nthe cat inside all the time. But you can never let the cat outside because it can\u2019t protect\nitself. We want people to feel free to go outside and do what they want.\n31 But some of our big cities are like war zones. Suppose we had taken away all the guns\nfrom people in Iraq. They couldn\u2019t protect their homes, their families, or their businesses.\nBecause the bad guys are getting guns from outside countries. We didn\u2019t really try to\ncollect all the civilian guns in Iraq because people wanted to be able to protect\nthemselves. We should do that in the US, too.\nSuppose you had been approached by someone wanting to be in business with you, or\nwanting a date or something, but that the government had taken away all your internet\naccess. You couldn\u2019t find anything out about them and you would be defenseless against\nsomeone trying to run a con on you or something like that. The government should let\npeople protect themselves if they want to, and so they shouldn\u2019t take away guns either.\nFor regular citizens, guns are just for defending yourself. They\u2019re sort of like alarm\nsystems. It wouldn\u2019t be right for the government to make it illegal to install an alarm\nsystem in your house or business. And it isn\u2019t right for the government to take away\npeople\u2019s guns.\nOne of the reasons police officers carry guns is that they go into nasty places and\nsometimes they get surprised and have to defend themselves immediately. That\u2019s just like\nwhat happens to regular citizens, too. They think they\u2019re safe, maybe because they\u2019re at\nhome, but suddenly they\u2019re surprised and have no time to call for help. So they should be\nable to protect themselves with guns, too.\nYou\u2019re allowed to buy rust protection for a car or a warranty for a computer, even though\nstudies say they\u2019re really not very good investments. But if people want to protect\nthemselves against rust or a broken video card, we let them do it. We should let them\nhave guns so they can protect themselves against violent crime, too.\nGun control is like Prohibition. Outlawing booze because a small fraction of people got\nsloshed was punishing to responsible drinkers as well. Why deprive responsible gun\nowners because a few people use guns irresponsibly?\nGun control is like trying to reduce drunk driving by making it tougher for sober people\nto own cars.\nLike a battleship parked off the coast its mere presence changes the dynamic of the\nsituation without having to fire a single shot\nCarrying a weapon for personal safety is much like having auto insurance. If you have it,\nyou may never need it. The day you don't is the day you wish you did.\nEvery society sits on certain pillars. If you kick one of the pillars out you don't know\nwhat will come falling down. In America those pillars are freedom of speech, freedom of\nthe press, freedom of religion, and the right to bear arms. Attempts to remove any of\nthose pillars would be disruptive and have major unintended consequences. A de-facto\n32 gun ban without altering the Constitution would prove disastrous. What Constitution\nguaranteed right would be next?\nGun ownership is like health insurance. You don\u2019t know when you are going to need it,\nbut you are at risk without it.\nThe right to own guns is a part of our constitutional order. Supporting gun control is like\nsupporting anarchy.\nPatriotic Americans own guns because they are like the revolutionaries who first fought\nfor our freedoms.\nThere is so much crime in the streets that people must protect themselves. Gun ownership\nfor people in dangerous areas is a tool of necessity like a paintbrush for a painter.\nConfederates sometimes lightly paraphrased these materials. After using their first\ntwo analogies, confederates inserted as many more (in any order) into each discussion as\nwas convenient. Each conversation had at least 3 analogies, up to a maximum of 12. A\ntotal of 843 analogies appeared in the 166 discussions. The confederates were trained to\nleave the analogies on the floor for as long as the real participant wished to discuss them.\nThe analogies were not pressed or reinstated, leaving the respondent in control of the\nanalogy\u2019s development in the discussion.\nThe pretense was that the two senators disagreed on the topic of gun control, and\nwere having a private preliminary meeting to see if they could come to some agreement\nabout jointly proposing national legislation. The participant was always assigned to favor\ngun control, and the confederate always argued against any restriction on gun ownership.\nBoth students were given briefings, putatively prepared by their staffs. The respondent\u2019s\nbriefing was about 4 pages long, single-spaced. It consisted mainly of quotations taken\nfrom a 2005 U.S. House of Representatives committee hearing on gun control and\nprovided information that favored the respondent\u2019s position. Source information\naccompanied each quotation. Participants were given as much time as they wished to\nstudy the materials, and they generally read the briefing carefully. Many highlighted\nportions of it or made marginal notes on the briefing pages. The confederate\u2019s briefing\ncontained the same information as well as some additional material, notably the analogies\nthat were to be inserted into the conversations. Except for the analogies, these were the\nsame topic, materials, and conditions as for the earlier studies (Hample, 2011a; 2011b).\nBoth conversants took their briefings into the room where the conversation took\nplace. Both commonly referred to their briefing during the interaction, sometimes\nparaphrasing or reading out portions of it. Participants and confederates were encouraged\nto address one another as \u201cSenator,\u201d and both were seated with nameplates identifying\nthem as Senator Jones or Senator Smith. The purpose of the role-playing, briefings, and\nnameplates was to encourage serious argumentation proceeding from a well-informed\nbase. All of the conversations took that tone. The conversations lasted about 5 minutes.\nThey were videotaped, and the portions involving the analogies were transcribed for\ncoding. Respondents were debriefed after completing the posttest attitude survey.\n33 The coding made use of a system first used in Hample, Jones, and Averbeck\n(2009) and later in Hample (2011a; 2011b) with modifications suitable to the different\nmaterials. The system has five categories, which are in order of increasing sophistication.\nThe categories were (1) accepts the analogy, (2) ignores the analogy, (3) rejects the\nanalogy without a reason, (4) rejects the analogy with a reason, and (5) takes up the\nanalogy and improves it as an argument. Code 5 was extremely rare in this data set. In the\ncase of codes 4 and 5, we did not evaluate the quality of the respondents\u2019 reasoning; we\nmerely noted if some were present. Notice that smaller numbers indicate more acceptance\nof the analogy and higher numbers indicate resistance or rejection. Given the assumption\nthat analogies are weak arguments, this means that lower numbered codes are the least\ncritically aware and the higher numbered codes indicate more refinement in the\nparticipant\u2019s argumentation skills.\nIn total, 166 people participated in the conversations. Of these, 40% were females.\nFreshmen constituted 30% of the sample, sophomores 33%, juniors 14%, and 24% were\nseniors. Most of the participants (56%) self-identified as Euro-American, followed by\n14% African-American, and 11% Asian American; the others were scattered among\nvarious ethnic backgrounds and national origins. The sample\u2019s average age was 19.7\nyears (SD = 1.51), their self-reported high school GPA was 3.67 (SD = .37) and their self-\nreported college GPA was 3.34 (SD = .42). Students received minor extra credit in\nvarious classes in return for their participation.\nData were collected in two semesters and a different undergraduate research team\nparticipated as confederates, videographers, transcribers, and coders in each semester. To\nassess reliability, the codes were treated as interval data and each coder was regarded as\nan \u201citem\u201d for the standard multi-item reliability estimates. In the first semester, 9 students\ncoded all the transcribed analogies, and their Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .92. In the second\nsemester, 13 coders prepared and coded the transcripts. Their Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .93.\nFor the analyses that follow, each analogy\u2019s code was the mean of the coders\u2019 ratings.\nReliability for the 5 item (1-7 Likert scale) measure of pretest attitude was .95.\nFor the same measure applied as a posttest, Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .93. The pretest mean\nwas 4.35 (SD = 1.72) and the posttest mean was 4.25 (SD = 1.74). These did not differ\nsignificantly (t = 1.05, df = 159, p = .29). The conversations did not result in attitude\nchange. The mean scores and standard deviations indicate that participants\u2019 attitudes\ntended to be distributed around the theoretical neutral point of the scale for both the\npretest and posttest.\n4. Results\nTable 2 shows the analogies\u2019 ratings, summed across all the analogies, by their\nordinal position (i.e., first analogy, second analogy, etc.) in the conversations. The overall\nmean rating of all the analogies in the study was 2.98, nearly equivalent to the code of 3,\nrejected without a reason. This critical attitude toward the analogies was apparently\nintuitive (see Mercier & Sperber, 2011) because the word \u201canalogy\u201d appears only 3 times\nin all the transcribed exchanges about the 843 analogies. Respondents did not appear to\nbe bringing any formalized apparatus to bear on the task of evaluating the confederates\u2019\narguments. On the whole, therefore, participants spontaneously found analogies to be\npoor arguments for a national gun control policy.\n34 Table 2\nDescriptive Statistics for Analogy Codes, by Ordinal Position in the Conversation\nOrdinal Position N Mean SD\n1 166 3.06 .79\n2 166 3.09 .81\n3 166 3.02 .89\n4 156 2.94 .89\n5 105 2.92 .89\n6 45 2.88 .84\n7 22 2.77 .79\n8 8 2.54 1.00\n9 5 2.40 .51\n10 2 2.42 .60\n11 1 3.69 ---\n12 1 2.00 ---\nExamination of Table 2 shows that many of the conversations had 5 or more\nanalogies, declining to only 22 conversations that had 7 or more, and only one\nconversation that had 12. Statistical analysis requires comparisons of ordinal positions\nthat actually had analogies. The best break point is to analyze the results for 5 or more\nanalogies (N = 105).\nFor these data, analysis does not show a significant effect on participants\u2019 coded\nresponses as more analogies appear in the conversations: Pillai\u2019s Trace F = .86, df = 4,\n101, p = .49. The power of this test is .88, assuming alpha = .05, effect size = .15,\ncorrelation among repeated measures = .20 (an approximate summary of the present\ndata), and the observed numbers of respondents and measurements. Table 3 displays the\nmeans for the subsample that had 5 or more analogies. These results indicate that\nparticipants\u2019 behaviors were essentially unaffected by whether they were hearing the first\n35 analogy, or the third, or the fifth in sequence. In short, there was no convergence effect,\nin contrast to what was found in earlier studies of examples and weak causal arguments.\nTable 3\nDescriptive Statistics for Analogy Codes, by Ordinal Position in the Conversation for\nOnly the First 5 Ordinal Positions\nOrdinal Position N Mean SE\n1 105 3.10 .08\n2 105 3.10 .08\n3 105 3.03 .08\n4 105 3.01 .08\n5 105 2.92 .09\nParallel analyses were conducted for conversations having 6 or more analogies,\nand for conversations having 7 or more. Conversations having 6 or more analogies (N =\n45) also did not display a significant effect (Pillai\u2019s Trace F = 1.13, df = 5, 40, p = .36).\nFor conversations with 7 or more analogies (N = 22), the analysis is again not significant\n(Pillai\u2019s Trace F = 1.49, df = 6, 16, p = .24).\nFigure 1 displays the mean ratings for analogies (the present study), examples\n(Hample, 2011b), and weak causal arguments (Hample, 2011a). The graph indicates the\nstatistically significant effects in the examples and weak causal arguments data, such that\npeople were more accepting of the arguments as they heard more of them. In contrast,\nreactions to analogies remained essentially unchanged as the conversations developed. In\nthe first ordinal position in the conversations, analogies were more acceptable than either\nthe examples or weak causal arguments. But both examples and weak causal arguments\nwere reacted to as the conductive arguments they were, converging collectively on a\nmore acceptable conclusion as the conversations developed. Reaction to analogies did not\nexhibit this effect.\n36 Figure 1\nRatings of Analogies, Examples, and Weak Causal Arguments by Ordinal Position in\nConversations\nAnalogies, Examples, and Weak Causal Arguments\nRating\n4\n3\nAnalogies\nExamples\nWeak Causal\n2\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nOrdinal Position\n5. Discussion\nConsistent with the warnings and reservations expressed by argumentation\ntheorists, the participants in this study were not much attracted to analogies. In contrast to\nthe examples study (Hample, 2011b), the analogy-ridden conversations were not effective\nin changing participants\u2019 attitudes. The essential response throughout these conversations\nwas to reject each analogy and its conclusion without giving a reason for the rejection.\nAlthough as argumentation teachers we would prefer that people be able to articulate\nwhat is wrong with an unconvincing argument, people are at least sensitive to the\nargumentative reality that analogies are not compelling reasons. This underscores\nMercier and Sperber\u2019s (2011) contention that people intuitively evaluate the connection\nbetween data and claim, and that evolution has made this ability consistently available to\nus all.\nThe key result in this study is a null one, namely that reactions to analogies do not\nshow any convergence as the analogies pile up. Proving a null hypothesis is not so\nstraightforward as supplying evidence of a substantial relationship between two variables.\nThe statistical power of the key test in this study was .88, which is generally taken as\nsufficient to make a null result worthy of serious attention.\n37 This lack of convergence \u2013 indicated by a disinclination to be more accepting of\nlater analogies in a sequence of them \u2013 contrasts with the results of two earlier studies\nusing essentially the same design. When people are confronted by a sequence of flawed\ncausal arguments (e.g., interpreting correlation as proof of causality) they eventually\nbecame more open to the arguments\u2019 collective conclusion as the weak arguments\naccumulated (Hample, 2011a). Similarly, when people were given example after example\nto sustain a general conclusion, they became less critical as the examples mounted\n(Hample, 2011b). The conclusion offered by those two studies is that arguments that have\nsome value but that are individually insufficient to sustain a conclusion can converge,\nreinforcing one another and creating what we might call joint or conductive sufficiency.\nThis did not happen with the a priori analogies used here. The individual\nanalogies were suitably weak and ordinarily rejected. It should be noticed (see Figure 1,\nfirst ordinal position) that the analogies were actually more acceptable than the examples\nor flawed causal arguments. So the lack of convergence cannot be due to any special\nweakness of the arguments, at least insofar as they compare to the arguments inserted\ninto conversations in the other studies.\nImportantly, this null result also means that the convergence effect found in the\nearlier work is not due to arguer fatigue. The conversations were the same length and\noccurred under the same conditions. The confederates initiated approximately the same\nnumber of arguments. In short, the quantity of arguing activity seems to have been\ncomparable in all three studies. So there is no reason to suspect that the circumstances of\nthis study were less onerous or otherwise less likely to exhaust the participants\u2019 patience\nor interest.\nThis study points to the conclusion that analogies simply do not converge. This\nclaim is of course limited by the topic, procedures, sample arguments, and sampling\nframe used in this study. It may also be very important that the analogies here were a\npriori analogies (Govier, 1989), since quite a different result was obtained using\nexamples, which are very similar to empirical analogies.\nReferences\nBermejo-Luque, L.

Anthony Blair\nUniversity of Windsor\ntblair@uwindsor.ca\nAbstract: Can there be an ethics of argumentation? The alternatives, that no norms apply\nto argumentation, and that any norms that apply to argumentation are exclusively non-\nmoral, are rejected. Three arguments are offered to support the moral normativity of\nargumentation. First, some standard moral norms apply to argumentation in particular;\nsecond, some standard obligations of argumentation seem to have a moral character in\nsome situations; third, there do seem to be moral vices and virtues attributable to arguers.\nHowever, the moral normativity of argumentation, where it occurs, has only pro tanto\napplication.\nKeywords: argumentation, ethics, etiquette, morality, moral norms, moral virtues\n1. Introduction\nSidney Hook, the American social philosopher, wrote the following about\ndiscussion and the democratic process:\nDiscussion is the life-blood of the democratic process, and, wherever discussion\nflourishes, controversy is sure to arise.\nCertain methods of controversy, however, poison instead of refreshing the life-\nblood of democracy. (\u2026) They seek to discredit persons rather than to consider\nproblems. They ignore or suppress relevant evidence. They aim to create a mood of\nrefusal to listen to views challenging some favored or dominant notion. Instead of\nexposing, confronting, reconciling or negotiating the conflicts of interest and\nopinion, one interest is fanatically identified with the common interest, and one\nopinion with the loyal opinion. (Hook, 1954)\nThis passage could have been written about the political polarization in the United States\nCongress since 2010, but in fact Hook wrote it over half a century ago during the heyday\nof McCarthyism. Hook did not call these democracy-poisoning practices immoral, nor\ndid he claim the authority of morality for all items on his list of ten \u201cground rules for\ncontroversy in a democracy.\u201d1 Given the value of democracy and the importance to it of\n1 1) Nothing and no one is immune from criticism.\n2) Everyone involved in a controversy has an intellectual responsibility to inform himself of the\navailable facts.\n3) Criticism should be directed first to policies, and against persons only when they are responsible\nfor policies, and against their motives or purposes only when there is some independent evidence of\ntheir character.\n4) Because certain words are legally permissible, they are not therefore morally permissible.\n5) Before impugning an opponent\u2019s motives, even when they may legitimately be impugned, answer\nhis arguments.\n40 free and open discussion, it is worth considering whether acts and practices that threaten\nto undermine such discussion are outright immoral.\nSuch a judgment assumes the more general proposition that there can be an ethics\nor morality of argumentation. It assumes that moral rights, duties or obligations can\nattach to engaging in the activities of argumentation\u2014in the making and using of\narguments for various purposes. It can also be viewed as the assumption that a person can\nexhibit and exercise moral virtues or vices in distinctive ways while engaged in\nargumentation. But are there moral norms associated with argumentation? I call the view\nthat there are, the moral normativity of argumentation position.\nThat argumentation has moral normativity does not imply that there are moral\nnorms unique to argumentation. Consider the analogy with professional ethics. To hold\nthat there are medical ethics, for example, does not imply that there are moral norms\nunique to the practice of medicine. It is, rather, to hold that certain generally applicable\nmoral norms\u2014in particular: beneficence, autonomy and fairness\u2014have applications in\nthe practice of medicine. Similarly, to hold that there can be an ethics of argumentation is\nto hold that there are moral norms that can apply to argumentation.\nThere seem to be two possible alternatives to the moral normativity position. The\nfirst is that no norms at all apply to argumentation. An arguer has no rights or obligations\nof any kind; arguers exhibit no virtues, and are prey to no vices. Arguing is thus like\nwalking or talking. One might stride athletically or limp along haltingly; one might talk\nwith a drawl or in a clipped manner\u2014these are just different ways of walking or talking\n(also possibly preferred or dis-preferred for one or another purpose). Similarly, in\nwhatever manner one argues, its features have no normative character. I call this the non-\nnormativity of argumentation position.\nThis non-normativity alternative is clearly a non-starter. At the very least,\nprudential obligations are associated with argumentation, obligations incurred as the\nnecessary means to a desired end. In order to persuade an audience or an interlocutor, an\narguer is obliged to use grounds it accepts for the claims in question. Also, if the arguer is\nto have a chance of success, the interlocutor must be allowed to voice objections and the\narguer needs to respond to them. These might not be moral obligations, but obligations\nthey are, for they are behaviors that are required for effective participation in the activity.\nSimilarly, there seem to be obvious virtues and vices attached to argumentation, such as\nthe skill and habit of clarity of expression and organization versus that of disorder and\nopacity of expression, or the skill and habit of keeping to the point versus that of\nwandering off onto tangents or introducing irrelevancies. These virtues and vices might\nnot be moral in character, but they are instances of norms that apply to argumentation.\n6) Do not treat an opponent of a policy as if he were therefore a personal enemy of the country or a\nconcealed enemy of democracy.\n7) Since a good cause may be defended by bad arguments, after answering the bad arguments for\nanother\u2019s position present positive evidence for your own.\n8) Do not hesitate to admit lack of knowledge or to suspend judgment if evidence is not decisive\neither way.\n9) \u2026 \u201cIt is not impossible\u201d is a preface to an irrelevant statement about human affairs. The question is\nalways one of the balance of probabilities. \u2026\n10) The cardinal sin, when we are looking for truth of fact or wisdom of policy, is refusal to discuss,\nor action which blocks discussion. (Hook, 1954)\n41 The second alternative to the moral normativity view is suggested by this rebuttal\nof the first one. Yes, there are rights and obligations, virtues and vices, associated with\nargumentation; but no, they are not moral in character. On this view the norms of\nargumentation are like the norms of chess or any other game. To play the game one is\ncommitted to going by the rules. These consist of various obligations, prohibitions and\npermissions.2 A rook may not be moved diagonally; a bishop may be moved only\ndiagonally. To move a rook diagonally is not to play chess immorally; it is to not play\nchess (or to not play \u201cstandard\u201d chess). Similarly, to different games there attach different\nvirtues and vices. A chess player might be patient or impatient, deliberative or impetuous,\nimaginative or plodding. But none of this has anything to do with morality. These\nobligations are commitments associated with playing the game; these virtues and vices\nare just habits that help or hinder in doing so successfully. Similarly, there are obligations\nassociated with engaging in argumentation. For instance, by asserting a point of view in\nan argument one incurs an obligation to defend it if it is questioned or otherwise\nchallenged. This is one kind of burden of proof obligation. Or, an arguer might be\ndisposed to be patient or impatient with frivolous challenges or querulous requests for\nclarification, or might be disposed to respond in an even-tempered way or curtly to\ncriticisms. But none of this has anything to do with morality. Any such obligations (or\nrights) are simply constitutive of the activity of engaging in argumentation and any such\nhabits are simply traits that are conducive to or interfere with effective argumentation. I\ncall this the non-moral normativity of argumentation position.\nIn this chapter I argue for the moral normativity of argumentation\u2014that there can\n(also) be obligations and virtues of a moral nature attached to argumentation.\n2. Morality, obligation and virtue\nWhat is implied by holding that obligations and virtues are \u201cmoral\u201d in character?\nObligations can be requirements constitutive of activity-types, such as the rules of games.\nOr, they can be requirements conditioned by objectives, such as what one is obliged to do\nif one wants to achieve a given end. Or, again, obligations can be requirements created by\nroles, such as the duties assigned to an occupational role, like the duties of a shipping\nclerk. None of these is a moral duty or obligation. Virtues are habits and dispositions\u2014\nexcellences, the Greeks called them\u2014which enable one to perform a function well. We\ncan thus speak of the virtues of a good actor, a good cook, a good athlete\u2014or a good\narguer (see Aberdein 2007); but none of these examples, except possibly the last one, is a\nmoral virtue. So what is it that makes an obligation or a virtue a moral one?\nNon-philosophers might\u2014or might not!\u2014be surprised that philosophers have\nfound this a vexing question. This is not the place to rehearse their controversies. For the\npurpose of considering whether arguing, especially arguing in public spheres, is subject\nto moral appraisal, I will follow mainstream opinions. For instance the respected\nAmerican moral philosopher, William K. Frankena, proposed that\nprinciples, codes and judgments are moral ones if (\u2026), besides being universalized\n[that is, holding for anyone in a similar circumstance] they are backed, at least\nwhen challenged, by reasons consisting of facts about what actions, traits of\n2 Strictly speaking these can be reduced to obligations. An obligation is a requirement to do something, a\nprohibition is an obligation to refrain from doing something, and a permission is the absence of any obligation\nto do or to refrain from doing something (see von Wright, 1963).\n42 character, etc. do to the sentient lives of those affected, including others if others\nare affected \u2026 . (Goodpaster, 1976: 192.)\nFrankena\u2019s account is similar to a more recent formulation in the Stanford Encyclopedia\nof Philosophy (Gert, 2008): \u201cMorality is an informal public system applying to all\nrational persons, governing behavior that affects others, and has the lessening of evil or\nharm as its goal.\u201d In other words\u2014or so I will assume for purposes of this discussion\u2014\nobligations and virtues are moral in character just when they are universalizable (i.e.,\nanyone similarly situated ought to follow them; they hold for all rational persons) and\nfulfilling them or exercising them affects the wellbeing of others.\nOverlapping with morality, but different from it, are the norms of etiquette.\nEtiquette differs in that its norms do not apply to all (rational) persons, but rather to\nmembers of particular cultures and sub-cultures (which can be as small as families); its\nrules change over time; and it has only the facilitating and smoothing of social\nintercourse rather than the wellbeing of others in general as its goal. Morality and\netiquette overlap because one can have a moral obligation to respect the rules of etiquette\nof a group with whom one comes into contact. However, in most circumstances\nviolations of rules of etiquette, such as using the \u201cwrong\u201d fork, are not morally culpable. I\nmention etiquette because some norms that apply to argumentation turn out to be not\nmoral principles but instead those of etiquette.\nWith this clarification of terminology in place, we can return to the nature of the\nnormativity of argumentation.\n3. The non-moral normativity of argumentation\nI\u2019ve noted that there are obligations that are or can be associated with\nargumentation that are not moral in character. For example, the rules governing the ideal\nconstruct called a \u201ccritical discussion\u201d in the Pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation\n(van Eemeren and Grootendorst, 2004) are obligations the observance of which is meant\nto be instrumental to the achievement of the outcome of that (idealized) procedure,\nnamely the rational resolution of a difference of opinion between two parties. The so-\ncalled \u201cten commandments\u201d of the \u201ccode of conduct\u201d proposed by proponents of that\ntheory are prohibitions meant to be instrumental, not moral. Thus, for example, it is not\n(or not normally) immoral to prevent a discussant from advancing a standpoint or calling\na standpoint into question (Commandment 1, van Eemeren and Grootendorst, 2004: 190).\nThe prohibition of that conduct is just, \u201ca necessary requirement for resolving differences\nof opinion, because a difference of opinion cannot be resolved if it is not clear to the\nparties involved that \u2026 [it] exists and what \u2026 [it] entails\u201d (ibid.). Similar rationales\napply to the other rules proposed in this theory. One does not have to subscribe to all the\ndetails of this particular theory to appreciate the practical applicability of many of its\nrules to all sorts of situations in which argumentation occurs, and the point is that such\nrules are justified on non-moral grounds, such as (among others) the promotion of\nefficient argumentation, coming to some resolution, or illuminating underlying\ndifferences.\nSimilarly, it must be conceded that there are virtues and vices distinctive of\nargumentation but that are not moral excellences or moral failings. For example, those\nwho have sat on deliberative committees are familiar with the following characters.\n43 \uf0b7 The repeater, that self-absorbed person who doesn\u2019t follow the argumentation in a\ngeneral discussion, or ignores it, and then jumps in with an argument that has already\nbeen given and responded to.\n\uf0b7 The hog, the person who monopolizes the discussion at the expense of other turn-\ntakers, using more than his or her fair share of available time, effectively taking time\nfrom other discussants.\n\uf0b7 The interrupter, who breaks in on speakers before they have had a chance to complete\ntheir contribution, or who speaks out of turn.\n\uf0b7 The open door pusher, who just has to state his or her case even though a favorable\ndecision is been made already and no further argument is needed.\n\uf0b7 The locked door pusher, who insists on making his or her case even though it is clear\nthat the sense of the body is that his or her cause has lost.3\nWe know these characters and we roll our eyes in exasperation when they pipe up\nin their predictable ways, but these are generally not moral failings. They are traits that\nexhibit a failure to appreciate what makes for efficient and effective argumentation. The\nrepeater, the hog and the interrupter are impolite, not evil. The open door pusher and\nclose door puller are ineffective, and time-wasters, but not (normally) morally culpable.\nThese vices (and their corresponding virtues) constitute norms of the \u201cetiquette\u201d of\nargumentation. These people have bad argumentation manners, but they are not in these\nrespects morally blameworthy people.\nClearly there are non-moral argumentation norms, namely both instrumental\nargumentation obligations and also virtues and vices of argumentation etiquette. So the\nargument for the moral normativity of argumentation cannot be based on the position that\nall of its normativity is moral in nature\n4. The moral normativity of argumentation\nTo see how moral norms can have application to argumentation, consider some\nother types of case in which there are moral norms associated with an activity. I have in\nmind the norms of conduct that apply to the actions of various professionals.\nTake medical ethics as an example. Physicians have obligations to patients, to\npatients\u2019 families, and to fellow medical professionals (other doctors, nurses, hospital\npersonnel, etc.). In particular they have, among others, the obligation to optimize the\ngood health of their patients, to respect the autonomy of the patient, and to distribute\nscarce health-care resources under their control in an equitable manner. The general\nmoral norms of beneficence, respect for autonomy and fairness have particular\napplications in the medical practice of physicians and other medical professionals, and as\na result there are moral prescriptions and proscriptions that apply to doctors, nurses and\nhospital or clinic staff in the practice of medicine.\nThe professional norms that are at the same time moral requirements have the\nproperty of being \u201cmoral\u201d because they are universalizable\u2014they hold for anyone\nsimilarly situated\u2014and they affect people\u2019s well-being. Such obligations arise in\nparticular in the practice of such professions because each is characterized by social roles\nand relationships that give rise to those particular applications of general moral norms. If\n3\nTo be sure, there are occasions when it is appropriate to make the arguments for a lost cause. See Robert\nAsen\u2019s (2005) discussion of \u201cresponsibility attribution\u201d in public sphere argumentation (130-131).\n44 any activity has distinctively moral norms, whether associated with a profession or not,\nthis feature will be at least one ground of those norms.\nTo be sure, arguing is not a profession. Arguments are tools that serve many uses\nand many kinds of activity. Argumentation\u2014the discussions employing arguments\u2014\noccurs in dormitory bull sessions, barber-shop or beauty-parlor conversations, political\nadvertisements and speeches, discussions in legislative committees, debates on the floors\nof legislatures, labor-management negotiations, school boards, university senates, faculty\nor department debates, scholarly articles, scholarly meetings, policy and planning\ncommittee meetings varying from those of federal government departments, to\ncorporations, to managerial staffs of small business, to union shop executives, to\nmembers of households, and so on and on. So it might seem that there is no one set of\nroles and relationships that give rise to moral obligations governing the way the\nargumentation is to be managed. On the other hand, constant in each of these venues\nthere exists the relationship between the arguer and his or her interlocutor or audience,\nand there exists the fact that argumentation is usually a purposive activity premised on\nseeking to achieve some goal. It is these features that ensure that the normativity of\nargumentation can be moral in some cases or in certain circumstances.\n5. Moral obligations of argumentation\nSpecifically, there are some pro tanto moral prohibitions that, by virtue of being\nspecial cases of more general moral prohibitions, apply to argumentation in some cases.\nBy a pro tanto reason, I mean one that has genuine weight, but nonetheless can in certain\ncircumstances be outweighed by other considerations. It is to be distinguished from a\nprima facie reason, which appears to be a reason, but might actually not be one (see\nKagan, 1989: 17).\n(1) It is unethical to use in an argument grounds one believes to be false. This\nnorm is a special case of the moral injunction against lying. Presenting a proposition as a\nground in an argument consists of asserting that proposition. Asserting a proposition\nnormally entails a commitment to its truth. Committing to the truth of a proposition one\nbelieves to be false normally entails the intention to deceive, and as such, is lying.4 And\nlying, other things being equal,5 is immoral. If \u201clying\u201d is too harsh a judgment for some\nreaders\u2019 moral sensibilities, it must at least be conceded that such argumentative behavior\nis dishonest\u2014and dishonesty is pro tanto immoral.\nOf course this norm (like any moral norm) holds only pro tanto\u2014so long as other\nthings are equal. It has moral weight, but it can be outweighed by other considerations in\nspecial circumstances. There are situations when it is morally permissible to assert a\nproposition one believes to be false, and in some situations there is even a positive moral\nobligation to do so. The prohibition against lying is quite correctly waived, for instance,\nin high school or college debates, or in bull sessions. In those contexts argumentation is\npart of a game or of play, for the purposes of which many moral requirements are\nsuspended. It is also possible to imagine situations in which the stakes are sufficiently\n4 Of course there are special cases, such as when one commits to a proposition one does not believe \u201cfor the\nsake of argument,\u201d as in a reductio ad absurdum argument, when commitment does not entail the intention\nto be truthful.\n5 The expression \u201cother things being equal\u201d or \u201cother things are equal\u201d (ceteris paribus) is normally\nunderstood to refer to other things pertinent to the matter at hand, and I will use it that way.\n45 high\u2014when so much, or such grievous, injury or injustice will occur if the argument does\nnot prevail\u2014that a deliberately false assertion, and so a false premise or a false inference,\nis justified on moral grounds.\nEven so, there is a general moral presumption in favor of honesty, and hence, of\nasserting only what one believes to be true. Consequently, when arguing there is a moral\npresumption in favor of asserting as grounds advanced in support of a thesis only\nstatements that one believes (i.e., considers to be true or reasonable to believe).\n(2) It is unethical deliberately to invite the interlocutor to commit or be deceived\nby what one believes to be a fallacy\u2014that is, is it unethical to offer an argument one\nbelieves to be fallacious as if it were legitimate or to make a fallacious argumentative\nmove on purpose. Deliberately arguing fallaciously is a case of trying to mislead the\ninterlocutor or audience, and since deliberately misleading is a variety of lying or\ndishonesty, which are pro tanto immoral, deliberately arguing fallaciously is pro tanto\nimmoral.\nAgain, there will be situations in which other things are not equal and as a result\nthere are exemptions from this norm\u2014when deliberately arguing fallaciously is not\nimmoral. The same kinds of circumstance that exempt arguers from the prohibition\nagainst deliberately asserting falsely would also exempt them from deliberately arguing\nfallaciously. For example, imagine trying to convince someone, who is standing on a\nrooftop thinking of committing suicide, to step away from the edge of the building: the\noverriding imperative is to persuade the person not to jump.\nStill, fallacious argumentation can be a special case of immoral manipulation or\ndishonesty. A use of abusive ad hominem can be a case of bullying. An illegitimate ad\nmisericordiam appeal can be emotional blackmail. And a knowing improper appeal to\nauthority passed off as legitimate can be intimidation. A deliberate straw man attack can\nbe dishonest misrepresentation, as can be a case of deliberate fallacious equivocation.6\n(3) It is unethical deliberately to misstate the epistemic status of claims used in\nargumentation. By \u201cthe epistemic status of a claim\u201d I mean whether it counts as\nknowledge or belief or faith or rumor or speculation, and so on. Is the claim known to be\ntrue? Or is it presumed true, expected to be true, or plausible, or is it an intuition, or\nspeculation, or a premonition or an article of religious faith or a guess?\nFor example, arguing against the Obama administration\u2019s health care legislation\nbecause it will result in America becoming a socialist state constitutes appealing to a\nmatter of belief, not of knowledge, and it is a highly problematic belief at that.\nConsequently, this premise should be qualified accordingly in arguments against that law.\nOr arguing for the legalization of abortion on the ground that a human embryo has no\nmoral significance is basing one\u2019s argument on a hotly-contested claim, which should be\nsignaled as such and not presented as a settled, objective fact. It is a moral lapse\nknowingly to make these misstatements of the epistemic standing of the claims in\nquestion, other things being equal, because that it is an instance of misrepresentation, a\nkind of lying or dishonesty, which are pro tanto immoral.\n6 These claims presuppose no particular theory of fallacy. They apply whether fallacies are conceived as\nviolations of speech act rules or as logical misbehaviors. On theories for which fallacies are pragmatic\nviolations, my contention is that such deliberate violations intended to deceive are at the same time, ceteris\nparibus, moral violations.\n46 It would be fair to say that the qualifier \u201cdeliberately,\u201d in a prohibition against\ndeliberately misrepresenting the epistemic standing of claims lets most people off the\nhook, since most people don\u2019t reflect much about the epistemic status of their claims.\nHere is where the ethics of belief would have application. How responsible are we for\nknowing the epistemic status of our cognitive attitudes (and hence of our assertions\nexpressing them)? But even if this self-knowledge cannot be required as a rule, it can still\nbe urged as an ideal to try to reach. In some cases we are entitled to judge that the arguer\nought to have known better. These three pro tanto principles illustrate the kind of\napplications to argumentation morality can have.\nThe moral salience and gravity of the issue under argumentative discussion and\nthe context in which the argumentation occurs make a difference to whether or when\nthese moral injunctions may be overridden. In some situations the topic and\ncircumstances render most of the above-mentioned norms inapplicable. For example,\nthink of a college dorm room bull-session about the merits of a movie, a band, or a team.\nFor the fun of it the students defend positions they don\u2019t believe in, use arguments they\nthink are wildly fallacious, and deliberately misrepresent one another\u2019s views. It\u2019s all for\nplay and mental gymnastics. As one commentator puts the point, \u201cthe violations of\nordinary argumentative norms that occur do not seem to be lapses of morality because the\ninterlocutors all understand that this is a case of eristic dialogue which is not bound by\nsuch norms.\u201d It would be moral heavy-handedness to object.\nIn other circumstances, respecting these norms is important. Imagine how\ninappropriate would be dorm-room bull-session behavior at a session of the United\nNations Security Council arguing over a resolution when war hangs in the balance. The\nimportance of respect for the office of the President is what made Representative Joe\nWilson\u2019s (2009) shouted interruption of President Obama\u2019s health care speech to the joint\nsession of Congress in September 2009 objectionable not just as bad manners, but\nmorally so.\nAnd yet, situation is everything. In contrast to the politeness expected to be\naccorded a President\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress, consider the shouted\ninterruptions of questions for, and of answers by, the Prime Minister or Cabinet Ministers\nduring parliamentary Question Period in the Canadian or British Houses of Commons.\nDisrespectful and insulting behavior has become standard and accepted as part of the\nconvention of this particular parliamentary institution. The result is that the value of\nQuestion Period has diminished, but parliamentary democracy has hardly been\nundermined.\nFurthermore, as Daniel O\u2019Keefe argues, \u201cA satisfactory general analysis of\nnormatively desirable argumentative conduct cannot be oriented only to the analysis of\nargumentative devices themselves, but rather must be situated within a broader\nunderstanding of the larger ends sought\u201d (2007: 1001-1002). To mention just one of\nseveral examples O\u2019Keefe discusses, a physician advising a patient about the risks of\ncertain individual behaviors such as smoking has to consider two things. (a) There is\nevidence that people tend to over-estimate such risks, so that if the physician provides\naccurate risk information, the patient is less likely to heed the warning. Also (b) by virtue\nof presenting the patient with risk information the physician is playing an advocacy, and\nhence paternalistic, role, not simply an advisory role (ibid.: 1000-1001). Should the\nphysician present accurate information knowing it is likely to be less effective? Should\n47 the physician be advocating at all? The path of virtue in argumentation is far from clear-\ncut and straightforward.\nIn sum, these moral judgments applied to argumentation must be made with\nsensitivity to context, and with a view to circumstances that might override their pro\ntanto moral standing.\n6. Obligations exclusive to argumentation\nSo far the obligations discussed are cases of general moral obligations as they\napply to argumentation. What about the obligations that are exclusive to argumentation,\nsuch as burden of proof obligations or the alleged obligation to seek out objections and\nthe obligation to respond to them (see Johnson 2000: 327ff.)? Are these moral obligations\nas well as instrumental obligations\u2014\u201ccategorical\u201d as well as \u201ctechnical\u201d imperatives, as\nKant (1959) would have put it? The alternative is to regard them as akin to obligations\nimposed by the rules that apply to anyone choosing to play a game.\nEngaging in argumentation can be a game (albeit a learning game), as in school\ndebates, or it can be a form of amusement (perhaps a kind of loosely-structured game\ntoo), as in coffee house bull sessions. Some such argumentative games (such as formal\ndebates) are defined by strict rules; others (such as bull sessions) have few and lax rules.\nStill, in both situations, moral considerations apply. A senior using polished debating\nskills to humiliate a freshman in a college bull session is behaving immorally no less than\nis the debater who by violating explicit debate preparation rules is cheating.\nThe concept of morality itself provides a clue as to whether, and if so, when,\nargumentation obligations take on a moral flavor. Assuming that a morality is a system of\nnorms that governs behavior that affects others with the goal of promoting their well-\nbeing, it follows that any actions that have the potential to affect the wellbeing of people\nare subject to moral appraisal. Using arguments to humiliate another person and cheating\nin the preparation of arguments for debate both qualify.\nIn many contexts and circumstances, argumentation has the potential to affect the\nwellbeing of other people. In legislatures, courts, boards of directors meetings, business\nplanning meetings, health-care and education institution planning and governing\nmeetings, political campaigns\u2014to give a short list of contexts\u2014the outcomes of the\nargumentation occurring in them will tend to be decisions that can benefit some people\nand harm others. And in all sorts of situations, public and private, argumentation can\nhave as its result attitudes, beliefs or decisions that can benefit or harm people. Moreover,\nsome kinds of argumentative behavior, such as monopolizing debate or browbeating\nopponents, can under certain circumstances violate the autonomy of the interlocutor. In\nsuch contexts and situations, going by the above reasoning, the manner in which the\nargumentation is carried out would be eligible for moral assessment. The manner of\nargument can exhibit respect for others and their autonomy, or denigrate the interlocutor.\nPresumably the obligations and virtues that theorists contend are associated with\nengaging in argumentation have the purpose of maximizing the production of cogent\narguments and wise judgments. Thus if such obligations attach to engaging in\nargumentation, then, when the outcomes are likely to have moral consequences, meeting\nthose obligations would be a moral duty. The greater the risk of harm or lost benefit from\nbad reasoning and poor argumentation, or the greater the disrespect for the other, the\nmore serious would be the moral lapse of failing to fulfill such duties.\n48 An implication of this position is that in political discourse the use of unjustified\nabusive ad hominem arguments against an opponent, the straw man distortions of\nopponents\u2019 positions on various political issues, the failure to respond to legitimate\nchallenges by the press or the opponent to a candidate\u2019s or party\u2019s stated positions\u2014all\nthese moves and others like them count, given the importance of the outcome for the\npublic welfare, as pro tanto immoral violations of argumentation norms.\nAs an afterword to the discussion of argumentation obligations, we might\nconsider whether scholarly argumentation is sufficiently important to justify regarding\nobligations of argumentation in scholarship as being morally weighty. The objective of\nscholarly inquiry, and so of the argumentation constitutive of it, is the asymptotic\napproach to truth, the search for the best judgment available at the time and under the\ncircumstances. The consequence of failures to meet burdens of proof, to seek out contrary\narguments to test one\u2019s assumptions, to respond to objections and counter-arguments, and\nso on, is presumably a greater risk of error than would occur if these argumentative\nobligations had been met. No doubt many academic errors, such as in the\nmisunderstanding of some obscure philosopher or poet, would and do have no impact on\nhuman wellbeing generally. The trouble is that if argument obligation backsliding is\ntolerated in some unimportant cases, there is a risk that it will become tolerated in others\nthat are not so unimportant. Whether this line of thought constitutes a fallacious slippery\nslope or prudent foresight is an empirical question. At the least, when the outcomes of\nscholarly research clearly do have import for public wellbeing, the argumentative\nobligations that are incurred take on a moral hue.\n7. Moral ideals, or virtues (and vices) of argumentation\nWayne Brockriede (1972) famously described three ways of engaging in\nargumentation in terms of three types of arguer: the rapist, the seducer, and the lover.\nInsofar as these types represent character traits, they might reasonably be classified as\ntwo argumentation vices and one argumentation virtue. The first two entail treating those\nto whom arguments are directed as objects to be manipulated, not persons with whom to\ninteract. The rapist seeks to overpower, forcing the interlocutor to assent by bullying and\nintimidation. The seducer seeks power too, but by manipulation instead of force, trying to\ngain assent by cajoling and trickery. In contrast, the lover respects the interlocutor as an\nautonomous equal partner in the argumentation and risks himself or herself in seeking\nassent. Corresponding to these types of arguers, Brockriede suggested, can be\nhypothesized types of interlocutors\u2014those who tend to submit to rape or seduction or\nthose who tend to resist, insisting upon being treated as lovers, as well as those who are\ncapable of responding to argumentation as autonomous equal partners.\nMy question is whether these vices and this virtue, or these two types of\nimperfection and one ideal, are moral vices and virtue, or moral imperfections and a\nmoral ideal. The alternative is that their value, or disvalue, is purely instrumental: you get\nbetter results if you argue as a lover than as a seducer or rapist. The trouble with this\nalternative is that it seems empirically false. For instance, we hear of evidence that attack\nads in political campaigns are effective. Yet I think Brockriede would nonetheless favor\narguing as lovers. I think he would contend that this is how anyone should behave in\narguing because it is good for both the arguer and the interlocutor, even if it is less\neffective than the alternatives. Furthermore, arguing as rapists or seducers entails\n49 disrespect for the interlocutor, or even more strongly, the dehumanization of that person\nor those persons. These are moral failings.\nNo doubt Brockriede\u2019s list does not exhaust the candidates for moral virtues and\nvices of argumentation, but they do show that such norms have force.\n8. Conclusion\nLet us return to Sidney Hook\u2019s ground rules for discussions in democracy with\nwhich this chapter began, and examine them on the basis of the moral normativity of\nargumentation. \u201c(1) Nothing and no one is immune from criticism.\u201d \u2014 This seems to be\na political principle stemming from the nature of democracy. \u201c(2) Everyone involved in a\ncontroversy has an intellectual responsibility to inform himself of the available facts.\u201d \u2014\nGiven the importance of affairs of state and the moral obligation to know the epistemic\nstatus of one\u2019s beliefs, (2) qualifies as a moral rule. \u201c(3) Criticism should be directed first\nto policies, and against persons only when they are responsible for policies, and against\ntheir motives or purposes only when there is some independent evidence of their\ncharacter.\u201d \u2014Inappropriate ad hominem attacks used as arguments are cases of the ad\nhominem fallacy, and given the importance of democratic discussion, are a moral\nviolation. \u201c(4) Because certain words are legally permissible, they are not therefore\nmorally permissible.\u201d \u2014An argument move\u2019s being legally allowed does not make it\nmorally all right. This principle applies particularly to straw man attacks and distortions\nin political attack ads. The law permits them, but when they distort, lie, or smear, they are\nimmoral. \u201c(5) Before impugning an opponent\u2019s motives, even when they may\nlegitimately be impugned, answer his arguments.\u201d \u2014This rule seems to be motivated by\ninformal logic rather than by morality. A person can have bad motives for a good policy;\nattacking his or her motives as a way of attacking the policy is in such a case logically\nirrelevant. The criticism of someone\u2019s motives for a policy proposal is relevant only as an\nexplanation of their support for a bad policy. \u201c(6) Do not treat an opponent of a policy as\nif he were therefore a personal enemy of the country or a concealed enemy of\ndemocracy.\u201d \u2014In other words, keep the discussion civil. Civility is arguably a moral\nvirtue. \u201c(7) Since a good cause may be defended by bad arguments, after answering the\nbad arguments for another\u2019s position present positive evidence for your own.\u201d \u2014This is a\nrule motivated by informal logic rather than morality: refuting an argument for a position\ndoes not refute the position. \u201c(8) Do not hesitate to admit lack of knowledge or to\nsuspend judgment if evidence is not decisive either way.\u201d \u2014This rule calls for a kind of\nintegrity in arguing: don\u2019t pretend to know what you do not. Integrity is a moral virtue.\n\u201c(9) \u2026 \u2018It is not impossible\u2019 is a preface to an irrelevant statement about human affairs.\nThe question is always one of the balance of probabilities. \u2026\u201d \u2014This rule bears on the\npractical reasonableness of political argument and not their morality. \u201c(10) The cardinal\nsin, when we are looking for truth of fact or wisdom of policy, is refusal to discuss, or\naction which blocks discussion.\u201d \u2014Discussion, which in the case of political affairs\nimplies argument, is so important to democracy that its refusal or subversion is morally\nculpable.\nGiven the value of democracy and the importance to it of free and open\ndiscussion, we can see that some of the acts and practices that threaten to undermine such\ndiscussion are indeed morally questionable, whereas others are objectionable on other\ngrounds. In sum, we are able to see that Hook\u2019s rules are a combination of logical,\n50 strategic and moral advice. We thereby see the moral normativity of argumentation in\npractice.7\nReferences\nAberdein, A. (2007). Virtue argumentation. Eemeren, F.H. van, Blair, J. A., Willard,\nC.A. and Garssen, B.

Klumpp\nUniversity of Maryland\njklumpp@umd.edu\nAbstract: The argument begins with an observation that polarization of the public sphere\nin the United States is marked not only by differences of value but also by differences of\nfact. Our theories of reasoning assume that public argument proceeds from mutually\naccepted factual premises. Pondering the problem, the essay considers where the facts for\npublic argument come from and why they have for so long had a stabilizing influence\nnow lost. The answer is that institutions of fact that sustained argument through the 20th\ncentury are now lost. The essay describes their demise and discusses the problems created\nby the need to construct argument in the absence of institutions of fact.\nKey Words: Argument, fact, ideology, media\nDuring the 2005 National Communication Association convention in Boston, I\nwas a participant on a panel entitled, \u201cToday's Political Polarity: Good or Evil?\u201d\nDedicated to my preparation for the panel, at the stroke of midnight the night before, I\ntuned my hotel television to the Discovery Channel\u2019s program entitled \u201cRed and Blue.\u201d\nThe strategy of this reality show was to take a politically astute family from Clinton,\nLouisiana \u2013 in the parlance of the program as red as Louisiana can get \u2013 and sit them\ndown in the house of a politically astute family in Topanga, California \u2013 as blue as\nCalifornia can get. The conservative Louisiana family would live for a month in the\nsocial circle of their liberal California counterparts. Similarly the family from the house\nin Topanga would live among red-state Cajuns. The viewers would, of course, ogle the\nreal knockdown, drag out fights that would surely ensue. The program did, to be sure,\nfeature argument. But an interesting thing happened. As the guests confronted the\narguments in their adopted venue, the argument stopped with a comment something like,\n\u201cWell, that simply is not true\u201d or \u201cI just do not believe your facts.\u201d I took special note of\nthis characteristic. In preparing for the panel in Boston, I had been reading that our\npolitics were polarized by a difference in values (see, for example, Hunter, 1992). Now,\n\u201cvalues\u201d is a slippery term, but in watching this program one was amazed that deep\nvalues tended to be shared, and when not shared, at least respected. Disagreement-\ninduced arguments ended not at differing values but at differing facts.\nSince that night, observing citizens arguing about our most polarized political\nissues, I find that this characteristic recurs: When argument stops, the unbridgeable\nbarrier is more often facts than values.1 In the fall of 2013, the implementation of major\n1 The democratic dialogue I ponder in this essay is the fabric of informal, dispersed discussion and debate\nthat shapes the direction of our political economy writ large and the specific issues we term \u201cpolicies\u201d that\nshape that direction at any moment. One of the effects, or perhaps one of the stimulants, of the differences\nin these processes in our time is the construction of democracy merely as the more ephemeral elections in\nwhich active voters choose representatives. Of course, a democratic public sphere is much broader than\nthis equating of democracy with election. Furthermore, although our media cast these elections within the\n52 provisions of the Affordable Care Act was on the horizon. Yet, contradictory facts so\nsurrounded that change in the system to finance medical treatment that confusion itself\nwas recognized as a barrier to full implementation. Who was required to obtain insurance\ncoverage? How were decisions about one\u2019s health care treatments to be made? What\ndisorders were covered by the assurances of the plan? Such simple and threshold\nquestions as these compounded continued rumors about death panels and rationing\nprocedures.\nOr consider questions of the impact of human activity on climate. Is the earth\nwarming? And, if it is, does warming somehow intensify major catastrophic weather\nevents? Is the process natural or created by human activity? Is that activity addressable or\nsimply a matter of the expanding number of humans on earth? Even before questions of\nvalue enter to influence recommendations on how to address the problem, if real, disputes\nabout the facts divide those in the debate.\nLittle wonder that facts are our stumbling block in ordinary conversation. In 2003,\nthe most important decision a nation makes \u2013 going to war \u2013 was justified with facts that\nwere not: arsenals of weapons of mass destruction, 9/11 connections, mobile biological\nweapons labs. At the most generous we had a policy driven by facts with no effective\ninfrastructure to determine them. Less generously, the charge was that neo-Conservatives\nin the Bush administration engaged in what we used to call \u201cfudging,\u201d or relying on their\nheart rather than their mind to determine the facts, knowing only what they needed to\nknow to justify their policy desires.2 In December 2005, the New York Times released\ninformation that the National Security Agency was conducting an electronic\neavesdropping operation listening to the presumably private conversations of United\nStates citizens (Risen and Lichtblau, 2005). A critical debate about the over-two-century-\nold principle of judicial check on government\u2019s right to explore the secrets of our lives\nand conversations was obfuscated by a contention that we cannot explore the facts of the\ngovernment\u2019s practices because \u201cwe cannot let our enemies know.\u201d\nIn this essay, I want to explore the crisis these examples illustrate: the difficulty of\nrelying on facts to resolve arguments in our culture. I will argue that we lie at a historical\nmoment when the institutions that have provided an authority of facts for over a century\nhave failed. I will begin by exploring the theoretical landscape that defines the\nsignificance of institutions of fact, locate the institutions in our historical moment, and\nthen describe their historical crisis.\n1. The Importance of Institutions of Authority\nWe will find a theoretical understanding of institutions of fact at the nexus of\nwhat Daniel O\u2019Keefe (1977) has labeled argument \u2013 making an argument \u2013 and\n1\nargument \u2013 having an argument. We begin with a closer look at argument , specifically\n2 2\nat argument in the public sphere. G. Thomas Goodnight describes the public sphere as a\nset of discourse practices. \u201cThe language of public address,\u201d he writes, \u201cemanates from a\ncommunity tradition of deciding and discussing priorities, constraining and protecting\nframework of the same polarized environment as the more important framework for determining direction\nand policy, the communication dynamic in elections is so different to require separate analysis. In this\nessay, I retain the focus on direction and policy.\n2 This perspective is articulated by Paul Pillar, former national intelligence officer from the Near East desk\nat the Central Intelligence Agency (Pincus, 2006).\n53 habituated prejudgments, and indulging and confronting common problems\u201d (1987: 429).\nGoodnight describes the public sphere as a dialectic between controversy and consensus\nin search of \u201cknowledge sufficient for informed decisions\u201d (431).\nThomas Farrell\u2019s central concept \u2013 \u201csocial knowledge\u201d \u2013 locates in Goodnight\u2019s\ndiscourse practices. Farrell describes social knowledge as shared practical knowledge that\npermits a society to proceed with productive argument. He posits that this social\nknowledge both informs and, in turn, becomes the product that perpetuates the public\u2019s\nproductive argument . Argument, he notes, proceeds from consensus to consensus. He\n2\ndoes not mean by this that for argument to proceed all must agree. \u201cBy definition,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201cthe knowledge which is distinctly rhetorical in function (...) must be based upon\na consensus which is attributed rather than fully realized\u201d (1976: 8). Farrell\u2019s move\nemphasizes the importance of commonly held grounds for proceeding through argument .\n2\nThus, his social knowledge, like Goodnight\u2019s, extends from a practical comfort with the\ndiscourse practice of argument to a set of understandings from which productive public\nargument reasons.\nThe theory describes a phenomenon easily visible to us. We can see people who\nwhen engaged in public arguments invoke the authority of facts in support of their\npositions. They do so with the firm expectation that their facts will resolve the argument\nin their favor. The governmental sphere has developed elaborate legal and deliberative\nprocesses in recognition of the power of facts as a basis for decision. Western democratic\nargumentative processes are built on faith in a common understanding to resolve\narguments satisfactorily.\nThe importance of these common understandings is evident if we examine\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s argument . Western notions of the individual argument have, since Aristotle,\n1\nfeatured the power of reasoning from the known and agreed-upon to the novel. Aristotle\nhad indicated that arguers must use as their \u201cmode of persuasion and argument (...)\nnotions possessed by everybody\u201d (c350 BCE/1954: 1355a). Today that definition is\nnearly universal. Toulmin (1958) points to arguments as built inferentially from \u201cthe facts\nadduced\u201d to \u201cthe conclusions drawn from them\u201d (13). Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca\n(1958/1969) call the known and agreed-upon quite simply the \u201cstarting points of\nargument\u201d (65). Brockriede\u2019s (1975) first characteristic of argument highlights the\n\u201cinferential leap from existing beliefs to the adoption of new beliefs or to the\nreinforcement of an old one\u201d (180). This view of argument posits the arguer as one who,\nwhen challenged, analyzes his/her interlocutor to understand the common basis of appeal\nthat the interlocutor will accede is proof of the arguer\u2019s claim. Thus, the texture of\neffective argument \u2013 persuasion as well as debate \u2013 has at its base commonly recognized\nstarting points.\nSo, our concern with the quality of the democratic public sphere leads us to ask:\nHow can a productively functioning public sphere provide such starting points of\ncommon understanding? Answering the question is complicated by a characteristic that\nRaymie McKerrow (1990) has noted in these argumentative communities: argument\n\u201cmay be characterized as less formal than that employed in other communities [such as\nscience, law, or academic disciplines]\u201d (38). The less formal public sphere must shoulder\nthe burden of a practical knowledge of argumentative practice sufficient to negotiate the\nargumentative alternative that is the texture of democracy. How can we count on that\nknowledge perpetuating itself?\n54 It is J\u00fcrgen Habermas who hints at an answer. In Between Facts and Norms,\nHabermas asks a question similar to ours: How can communicative action take us from\nvalid facts to the normative force of policy mandates? He works out the problem by\njuxtaposing law and democratic freedoms to solve this problem \u201cinstitutionally.\u201d His\nsolution is not totally satisfactory. Those exploring issues of civic life from the\nperspective of the American communication discipline read Habermas\u2019 central solution in\nthe analysis of intra-governmental processes as misplaced; not wrong but mislocating the\nproblem. As intra-governmental processes have become more alien in the United States,\nnearly speaking a language which ordinary citizens find an affected patois, the problems\nof civic democracy seem much more real as problems requiring what Habermas (or his\ntranslator) misnames \u201crepublican\u201d theory (1992/1996: 296).3 Despite divergence in\ndefining the problem, what this essay does borrow from Habermas is the European\nstructuralist interest in institutions. For it is institutions that convert the reproductive\nforce of argument into reliable argumentative practices. Institutional inertia provides an\n2\nextra habitual quality to the more informal processes of the democratic public sphere.\nMy project has now emerged. I want to explore our problem of anomie by\nstudying the institutions that frame the social knowledge of starting points of argument.\nSo, I focus upon the clusters of argumentative power that have in the past provided the\ninstitutions of authority for argument in American democracy and that are now in crisis.\nThese institutions are historically defined. That is, they are not a matter of theoretical\nidentification but a matter of historical study. And at our historical moment we detect\ntrouble in the current institutions so necessary to fruitful civic argument.4\n3 I call this a misnaming because the perspective Habermas labels \u201crepublican\u201d \u2013 \u201cdemocratic will-\nformation takes the form of ethicopolitical self-understanding\u201d \u2013 is most often characterized as\n\u201cdemocratic.\u201d See Klumpp (1997).\n4 Although a full history of the institutions of fact is beyond the scope of this study, a brief account may\nsharpen understanding of the current moment by foregrounding it in historical relief. Habermas traces the\nsources of these institutions to the dawn of public opinion in the philosophy of the enlightenment and the\npractical argument in the public coffee houses of the 17th and 18th centuries (1962/1989: 89-117).\nThese enlightenment ideals led the founders of the United States to privilege a public sphere and\nthe founding documents envisioned institutions that would develop public knowledge. The first amendment\nin the Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution recognized the institutions of that day, including\nsome now in eclipse. The right to assembly coupled with the right to petition highlighted the role of citizens\ngathered in public discussion in the early republic. A dominant institution of the day, before mass petitions\ndominated the right, was gatherings of citizens who drafted petitions to their public officials on issues\naffecting the public weal (Stewart, 2002). So strong was the appeal of public participation that less\ndemocratic institutions of fact such as the minister of Puritan New England were easily eclipsed in public\ninfluence, their diminished role finalized by the first amendment\u2019s endorsement of religious pluralism\n(Snyder, 2001: 302). Through the early republic, the enlightenment\u2019s preference for commonsense\nexperience institutionalized itself in such fora.\nBy the mid-nineteenth century, the United States was in the full power of the age of great oratory.\nThese great orators, educated in a system of public morality, became admired fonts of public knowledge.\nTheir great speeches were delivered to thousands on civic occasions and reprinted in large quantities (Clark\nand Hollaran, 1993). Although newspapers of the era were highly partisan and generally not trusted, books\nand large circulation magazines dominated public reading and became institutions of public knowledge.\nSchoolbooks such as McGuffey\u2019s Readers became commonplace and the Atlantic, North American Review,\nand Harper\u2019s became staples of public knowledge. By the Civil War, sermons from the pulpit, abolitionist\ntracts and Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s novel Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, had fixed an image of American slavery in\nthe minds of the Northern public, countered by contrary sources generated in the South. Late in this era,\nanother important institution was the Lyceum. Traveling speakers on a variety of public subjects\n55 2. The Breakdown of Historical Institutions of Truth\nMy historical premise is that in the 20th century the consensus starting points of\nsocial argument were entailed in the institutions of the mass media and government. Our\ndemocracy avoided the problems of anomie because in the end we had recourse to these\ntwo institutions to provide reliable starting points to resolve the controversies of\ndemocratic dispute. At the dawn of the 21st century, however, these institutions have\nfailed. The result is a weakened civic argument.\n2.1 The Rise and Fall of Mass Media\nHistorically, the 20th century was the era of mass media. The technology of print,\nradio, and television could be narrowly controlled and that control was achieved by\npolitical and ideological systems in nations throughout the world. The United States was\nno different. Michael Schudson (1978) has tracked the emergence of what became known\nas \u201cprofessional journalism\u201d to the commitments of Adolph Ochs of the New York Times\nin the late 19th century, even before the heyday of yellow journalism. The commitments\nthat arose were to ethics and to a craft. The ethical commitments included the centrality\nof objectivity, a sense of responsibility to democracy, and the importance of \u201cgetting it\nright.\u201d The craft included such rules as multiple sourcing, the importance of the probing\ninterview, and the fulsome report defined by the five Ws and the inverted pyramid style.\nThese commitments and skills yielded a journalism in which society placed trust as an\narbiter of fact.\nSchudson also described the period after World War I when this journalism rose\nto power as a time when an argument from fact triumphed over an argument from moral\nprecept. The rise was fueled by the specialized training in journalism at American\nuniversities and the growth of the market as a fact-based natural arbiter of value seated in\nthe accuracy of information. \u201cOnly then,\u201d he wrote, \u201cdid the ideal of objectivity as\nconsensually validated statements about the world, predicated on a radical separation of\nfacts and values, arise\u201d (1978: 120-121). Journalists first traded in facts for the market,\nand then facts became central to the quality of decisions.\nThis was also a time of ascendancy for democratic faith. To be sure, this faith was\nmore republican than democratic, but with a social gradation based in knowledge and the\nability to reason rather than inheritance, wealth or moral stature. In the United States,\ninterspersed informative presentations with entertainment programming to spread an understanding of the\nworld through public gatherings (Ray, 2005).\nVariations on this latter institution came to dominate public life following the Civil War. The age\nof oratory passed and the colleges that taught moral virtue before the war evolved to develop scientific and\ntechnical knowledge feeding the industrial revolution. This move was formalized in the founding of the\nland grant universities with their extension services that disseminated the results of scientific research to the\ngeneral citizenry (Snyder, 2001: 303) through speakers bureaus. The land grant college idea recognized the\ndifference between the technical and the public sphere, and took as its central mission the crossing of that\ndivide: dedicated to scientific research in practical problems and to promulgating that knowledge through\nthe popular speaker conveying scientific knowledge to the citizenry.\nBy the 1930s, progressive thought and Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal had brought scientific and social\nscientific thought into government. The media also evolved as newspapers and magazines such as Scientific\nAmerican became the interpreters of the technical knowledge of science. As the visual dimension of media\ndeveloped through the 20th century, the media also came to present the image as a dimension of factual\nsocial knowledge (Hariman and Lucaites, 2007).\n56 faith was retained in the virtue of fact over untruth in the expectation of public opinion.\nAnd from the progressive era on, a faith in democratic education to expand the upper,\nrational classes into governmental participation was alive and active in the debate over\ngoverning. Journalism posited itself at the heart of this progressive energy. For a ruling\nclass that based its legitimacy in a realistic response to facts, the market value of fact was\nhigh. Journalism became the popular conduit of objective fact to the masses that were\npositioned as legitimizers of rule by rational experts.\nThe development of a national media during and after World War II enhanced\nrespect for the journalistic profession. This legitimation framework privileged\nprofessional journalism as reasoning from facts was elevated, despite the warnings of\nsuch conservatives as Richard Weaver (1970/1985). This was the atmosphere into which\nEdward R. Murrow asserted electronic journalism. His CBS news organization spawned\ninvestigative electronic journalism with its CBS Reports series including \u201cHarvest of\nShame\u201d and the \u201cSilent Spring,\u201d incorporated it into the regularly scheduled evening\nnews program, ultimately elevating Walter Cronkite, the most trusted man in America, to\nits anchor (O\u2019Connor, 1972). When Cronkite declared the war in Vietnam unwinnable,\nLyndon Johnson\u2019s White House sighed; Johnson declared that the game was over.\nBut the commitments, the celebration, and the faith in professional journalism as\nan authority for facts probably peaked with Walter Cronkite and the investigative work of\nWoodward and Bernstein.5 There are many reasons for the erosion of the faith in\nobjective journalism and in the media as a source of fact for argument. The first is\neconomic. Even as Ochs and his compatriots constructed the values of journalism in the\n1890s there was a competing model, known famously in the era as \u201cyellow journalism,\u201d\nthat attempted to build mass audiences on sensationalism and voyeurism. This model for\nthe media never disappeared, but the professional journalists managed to ghettoize the\npractices as the tabloid press, an inferior and less noble model of journalistic endeavor.\nWhere professional journalism stressed values and craft as the measure of journalism, the\nalternative stressed sales in the market.\nIn the late 20th century, after the renewal of business primacy in the Reagan years,\njournalism again turned to the values of profit. Newspapers merged into once-daily\ndelivery as readership diminished. Electronic news transformed from a source of a\nnetwork\u2019s pride in public service to a contributor to a network\u2019s profitability.\nEntertainment moguls such as Roone Arledge took over news divisions. Gradually, the\npursuit of profit moved from a grace note in discussions of the values of journalism to\nitself becoming a fact that tested the commitment of journalists to reality.\nEqually important, however, was the debate over how to express the value of\nobjectivity. When the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was established to\nmanage the commodification of the wave spectrum, the strength of the values of\nobjectivity and fact demanded that the FCC impose these values on the users of public\nairwaves. The result by the 1950s was a definition of objectivity as \u201cthe absence of bias\u201d\nand the operationalization of \u201cthe absence of bias\u201d as \u201cbalance.\u201d Two changes resulted.\nFirst, the transformation tied facts to political positions that had to be balanced. Second,\n5 Polling data support this marker. \u201cTrust and confidence in the mass media\u201d has declined from 72 percent\nof the public in 1972 to 50 percent today. The poll also indicates that the trend falls into the divisions of the\ncountry\u2019s political polarization. Thirty one percent of Republicans and 70 percent of Democrats trust the\nmedia. (Carroll, 2005).\n57 facts as a mediator among alternative ideas were now dethroned. The assumption that\nfacts adhered to political positions and balanced between opposing positions, despite its\nobvious argumentative silliness, diminished the promise of facts as arbiters of\ndisagreement.\nThird, there was an accompanying intellectual movement, the linguistic turn. Fact\nhad been enshrined into its central place in the early century by a faith in the productive\nobjectivity of the methods of science and social science. Now, Rorty, Burke, and\nargumentation scholars including Scott, McKerrow, Fisher, Gronbeck, and the POROI\nproject, began to question the status of facts as determined by a word\u2019s correspondence to\nreality. The critique within the academy spread to a general intellectual movement that\nundermined the scientific paradigm particularly in the social sciences.\nFourth, the march of technology undermined the media\u2019s place as an institution of\nfact. As developing technology moved the electronic toward live broadcast, the spaces in\nwhich the journalist\u2019s craft processed raw experience into refined fact disappeared.\nElectronic broadcast now more and more brought cameras into the venues of real events.\nReality became direct witnessing via video and audio. Trained journalists seemed\nimportant only when they warned us not to trust what our eyes told us was fact. In the\nextreme there was even the sense that unwitnessed events were either insignificant or did\nnot occur. Technology even reinforced the economic pressure. The explosion of new\nchannels and the growth of the internet increased the economic pressure to differentiate\nnew sources of news.\nFinally, the topos of media bias became a useful way of undercutting the\ndominant ideology of policy based in fact. Perhaps most famously, by 1969, Spiro\nAgnew (1969) delivered an extended attack on professional journalism and railed against\nthe media as the \u201cnattering nabobs of negativism\u201d (Agnew, 1970). As time passed, the\nbiased media became a commonplace of conservative argument. The uses of that term\n\u201cbias\u201d in FCC regulation became a central topos in the political struggle of ideas at the\nturn of the 21st century. A network came along programmed to the right and proclaimed\nits centralness with the slogan \u201cfair and balanced.\u201d\nBy the turn of the 21st century, the value of fact remained strong among\nprofessional journalists, but their practices had begun to hollow out the execution of the\nvalue. Which brings us to January 2, 2006, and to Sago, West Virginia. Thirteen miners\nare trapped by an explosion underground in a coalmine like many others in Appalachia.\nThe media flock to tiny Tallmansville and nearby Sago Baptist Church. Anderson\nCooper, the latest hip version of objective journalism, brings his anchor position to the\nmine. Airtime must be filled. With mine officials preoccupied in managing the rescue\nfrom the quarantined headquarters building, local citizens will do. They report their\nfeelings about mining, about the mining company, about the trapped miners, about their\nhopes and dreams and how they are economically dependent on the mine. The Governor\nof West Virginia does emerge occasionally to be an official source. Cooper struggles to\nreport news using the two-source rule of his craft within the framework of real time\nbroadcast. Then deep in the mine a communication is misunderstood. A mid-mine relay\nstation reports to the office that all the miners but one are alive and well. Cell phones\nbreak the quarantine, spreading the news immediately to the waiting and already grieving\nrelatives in the church. Cooper has no chance to interview, to identify sources, to use the\nmethods of his craft. Church bells begin to ring and Cooper relays the interpretation that\n58 this is a sign of the rescue. Still feeling the lack of a firm source, Cooper watches as the\nGovernor passes in an automobile, giving a thumbs up. Starving for a confirming source,\nthis suffices. The word goes out. Celebrations begin. Rumors spread that the rescued\nminers will be brought to the church by bus for the joyful reunion with families. The\ngrieving turns to carnival and the feelings of joy fill the airwaves in the absence of\nquestions and the testing of evidence. One ambulance passes by Cooper\u2019s station and cars\nare seen passing from the headquarters to the church. No bus brings the rescued men, but\nperhaps they are receiving last minute debriefing.\nThen, of course, a lonely relative comes down the road and announces to Cooper\nthat all, save the one in the ambulance, are dead. Cooper probes for sources. No probing\nis viable; this is a grieving messenger. The abrupt turn of the coverage has by now caught\nthe mainstream print media with blazing headlines of hopeful salvation. Cooper keeps\nrepeating \u201cthis is unbelievable.\u201d\nThis episode was to be repeated, even by Cooper\u2019s own network. Sometimes fact\nchecking was replaced by attribution of source \u2013 \u201cThe AP is reporting (...)\u201d (reporting the\ndeath of Gabrielle Gifford, see Tenore, 2011). Sometimes erroneous reports were freely\noffered with warnings \u2013 \u201cAnd I want to alert our viewers, sometimes these initial\nconclusions can be very, very wrong.\u201d \u2013 or announcements of withdrawals \u2013 \u201cWe are no\nlonger reporting that (...)\u201d (Navy Yard shootings, see O\u2019Neal, 2013). Sometimes the\nefforts to check facts were simply a victim of the rush to report (falsely reporting arrests\nin the Boston Marathon bombing, see Reider, 2013). Today the failures of media\nprofessionals in the gathering, verifying, and reporting of reliable facts is embossed on\nthe screens and the newsprint of the nation. Today few view the media as an institution\nthat delivers reliable facts as the starting point of argument.\n2.2 The Rise and Fall of Reliable Government\nThe other institution that provided a common sense of fact in the 20th century was\ngovernment. As the 20th century dawned, the progressive movement was promoting\ngovernment as a regulator of economic abuse. The progressives sought to democratize\ngovernment and through the force of democratization to impose government as an arbiter\nof the power of society. A key to that strategy was to establish reliable sources of\ninformation within government to serve as a basis for objective and fair regulation. In\n1913, a major reform of the Wilson administration established the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics within the new Department of Labor. The Bureau would take the pulse of the\nnation\u2019s economy and report a statistical profile monthly.\nThe Bureau was the beginning of a social scientific revolution in regulation. In the\nsame year the Federal Reserve Act established an arbiter of the nation\u2019s money. Soon the\ncensus bureau\u2019s already well-established function of descriptive as well as enumerative\npower was reinforced within the Department of Commerce. Other progressive legislation\nsuch as the Pure Food and Drug Act established the government as an honest broker and\nprotector of the public.\nIt was, however, Franklin Roosevelt and those of his administration who raised\nthis progressive faith in government to a national institution. Roosevelt\u2019s so-called \u201cbrain\ntrust\u201d cemented the power of social science throughout government. The alphabet\nagencies of the New Deal multiplied the bureaucratic arbiters of fairness and truth. The\nbrain trust also introduced the centrality of academics to the declaring of truth. The expert\n59 from the academy or from the regulatory agency reported to Congress and to the\npresident who listened in order to base actions in the soundest knowledge of science, the\neconomy and the society. These experts, in turn, became sources for the media.\nTo this faith in experts, FDR (1933) added his own credibility. \u201cThe only thing\nwe have to fear is fear itself,\u201d he famously promised in his inaugural address. But even\nbefore that declaration, Roosevelt had promised a \u201ccandor\u201d and \u201cto speak the truth, the\nwhole truth, frankly and boldly.\u201d After Hoover\u2019s promises that prosperity was right\naround the corner, Roosevelt\u2019s promise opened the opportunity to declare bad news as a\npart of the solution to the problem. The first fireside chat on banking (Roosevelt,\n1933/2005) reassured a nation with a message designed to explain the actions of the\nadministration and reasoned from the \u201csimple facts\u201d with which he began his broadcast.\nBefore the second New Deal had run its course at the beginning of the 1940s, the\nRoosevelt administration had sent forth photographers from the WPA and the\nDepartment of Agriculture whose images of the depression became the definitive\nmemories of that time (Finnegan, 2003). When war came, the only restriction on the\nreports of a free press from the front was the need to protect \u201cour brave boys\u201d from harm.\nThus, by the middle of the 20th century, the government had developed principles\nand agencies above politics and dedicated to management of the economy and society\nthrough accurate information and candor. This belief was reinforced during the Cold\nWar. The propaganda of communism was contrasted with the openness and candor of the\nUnited States government. Even the first of the Cold War agencies \u2013 the Central\nIntelligence Agency \u2013 was established so that the policy makers of government had a\nreliable source of information upon which to base the policies that would fight the Cold\nWar. The World War II rationale for secrecy was extended to the agency but, as a sign of\nthe power of openness, that secrecy had to be justified; reliable information was so\nvaluable that its protection was a major objective of the war effort. Agencies such as the\nUnited States Information Agency and Radio Free Europe were established to fight\ncommunism by restoring the faith in information that communism sucked from its\nenslaved people.\nOf course, the seeds of the destruction of the government as an institution for\ntruth were sown broadly in Vietnam. Indeed, the earliest clash of public opinion in that\nwar was over whether the assurances of government could be trusted. As much as\nanything, Walter Cronkite\u2019s declaration that the war could not be won had its profound\neffect on American public opinion because it split the two institutions of fact \u2013 media and\ngovernment. Then came Watergate and any notion that the errors of Vietnam were errors\nof judgment disappeared into the web of deception that was at the heart of the intrigues of\nthe Nixon administration.\nWhen the Reagan administration came to power, they understood where the\npower of the New Deal rested. Reagan\u2019s first budget proposed vast gutting of the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau and other agencies (Reinhold, 1981) designed to\ndocument the programs of the War on Poverty and other late New Deal initiatives. It was\npart of the distrust of government that Reagan had captured in his campaign. In his\ninaugural address, Reagan (1981) offered a candid assessment of the nation\u2019s\nmalfunctioning economy and then diagnosed \u201cin the present crisis, government is not the\nsolution to our problem, government is the problem.\u201d\nHis stand became one of the hallmarks of the conservative movement, arraying\n60 the public against a big government that molded facts and truth to meet the big\ngovernment agenda that fed a bureaucratic beast. By this time, investigative journalism\nhad pitted the two institutions of fact \u2013 the media and government \u2013 against each other in\na battle that would destroy the credibility that both had enjoyed earlier in the century. I\nshould add that the conservative attack also turned toward the handmaiden of\ngovernment, the academy. Today, Fox News and the other organs of conservative fact\nregularly portray the universities as the home of the last remnant of leftist ideology\nseeking to inculcate falsehoods in our vulnerable youth (see, for example, Starnes, 2013;\nLimbaugh, 2007).\nBut the demise of government as an institution of truth is not confined to\nconservative critique. I need not spend much time contrasting Adlai Stevenson\u2019s (1962)\npresentation to the United Nations Security Council with its progeny, Colin Powell\u2019s\n(2003) laying out of the case against Iraq. The United States is returned to the time when\neven the most vital decision a nation ever makes \u2013 the decision to devote its treasure and\nblood to the destruction of war \u2013 is a decision made on the basis of faulty information and\nthe failures of the facts, justified by the purity of its \u201cobjectives\u201d rather than the reliable\npresentation of facts (Klumpp, 2006).\n3. Do Conservatives Hate Facts?\nI began this essay with a story of political polarity. That story portrayed both\nliberals and conservatives seeking, offering, and denying facts. Furthermore, as I have\ntraced the demise of trust in our institutions of fact, both liberals attacking government\u2019s\ncredibility over the Vietnam and Iraq wars and conservatives\u2019 attacks on biased media\nand New Deal statistical institutions have been identified as responsible for the\ndiminished faith in the media and government. Indeed, I have also pointed to causes such\nas the emergence of live broadcast that owes its force to neither liberal nor conservative.\nBut the vociferousness with which conservatives attack the mainline media, and their\nrejection of facts in key public issues such as global warning, has left an impression that\nit is conservatives undercutting the institutions that provide facts to our public sphere.\nPolls document the impact of the conservative argument that a biased media distorts\nfacts.6 Ronald Reagan\u2019s actions upon becoming president overtly targeted the purveyors\nof facts within government agencies. The prominence of conservatives in the popular\nnarrative of the destruction of the 20th century\u2019s institution of facts raises the question:\nDo conservatives hate facts?\nCareful attention to conservative argument quickly answers this question:\nconservatives argue from facts just like everyone else. The impasse in argument occurs\nnot because some urge the acceptance of facts and others dismiss facts as a basis of\nargument. So, why does the attack on institutions of fact seem so one-sided? Is there a\nrelationship between ideology and argument?\nIn Making Sense of Political Ideology, Bernard Brock, Mark Huglen, Sharon\nHowell and I (2006) argue that the strategies selected by rhetors are a more reliable\nmarker of political ideology than are the policy positions which political actors support.\nTaking a cue from Kenneth Burke\u2019s linking linguistic strategies to particular philosophic\n6 A plurality of people in the United States believes that the media is too liberal. But that figure obscures\nthe partisan nature of the belief. Seventy-four percent of Republicans but only 19 percent of the Democrats\nview the media as too liberal. See Mendes (2013).\n61 positions, we argue that when political actors reason from the world as they perceive it to\njustify public action, their accounts will be structured in patterns clustering around\npolitical ideology. We illustrate how accounts that begin in understandings of purpose\nand principle characterize reactionary discourse; accounts beginning in the character of\nhuman participants characterize conservative discourse; accounts rooting justification in\ndescriptions of material conditions characterize liberal discourse; and accounts that begin\nexplanations in the pragmatic impact of systems on people and conditions characterize\nradical discourse. Can this same tendency be carried into the starting places of argument?\nIs the conservative attack on the institutions of argument because those institutions have\nauthorized the superiority of the liberal\u2019s material facts as the starting place for\nargument?\nThe argument seems plausible. Schudson (1978) supports its historical plausibility\nwith his assertion that in the early 20th century the argument from material fact triumphed\nover the argument from moral precept. Indeed, the conservative argument of a biased\nmass media trumps the claim to objective facts with an assertion about the distorting\npower of ulterior motive or purpose. Our tracing of the origin of government fact bureaus\nexplicitly identified them with a commitment to record material fact and a commitment\nby progressive government to base government decisions on material fact. Thus, an\nattempt to undermine them would be justified by their irrelevance to conservative starting\npoints of argument: principle and individual character.\nIndeed, this distrust of material fact can be traced to the conservative movement\u2019s\nfavorite rhetorical theorist: Richard Weaver. In Ethics of Rhetoric, Weaver offers an\nethical hierarchy of arguments. At the top of that hierarchy Weaver identifies the\nargument from definition or principle, reasoning from universal principles. The lowest\nform of argument, Weaver argues, is the argument from circumstances, the argument\nfrom material facts. As facts change, so do the conclusions of such argument, from\nWeaver\u2019s ethical perspective casting doubt on the quality of the argument (1953: 86).\nAlthough Weaver\u2019s ethical judgments do not map perfectly on Burke\u2019s description of\nphilosophical perspective,7 the ethical judgments elevate the arguments we have\nidentified as those of a reactionary over the arguments of liberals. When George W. Bush\nreasoned from the fact that freedom burns strong in every human heart (for example,\nBush, 2004), he offered an argument starting in a universal fact and reasoning to a broad\nset of governmental policies. When he insisted that the events of 9/11 traced to the evil\nterrorists (for example, Bush, 2006), he appealed to facts about the perpetrators of the\nattack. Thus, his facts were about the nature of humanity and human character rather than\ncircumstances. On the other hand, when Barack Obama asked Americans to find\nmotivation for the control of guns in the serial episodes of mass murder, he rejected\nWeaver\u2019s hierarchy, pointing to and seeking to amplify the motivating power of the stark\nfacts played out in recurring tragic circumstances (Obama, 2013). Thus, the character of\nthe fact employed in argument differs across ideologies, and it is so-called liberal\n1\n7 Contained in the Burke archives at Penn State University is a letter addressed to Richard Weaver by\nBurke but never sent. It was a strongly worded charge that Weaver had plagiarized Burke. Burke had\nvisited the University of Chicago at a time when he was urging the ideas of his Grammar of Motives and\njust before Weaver published his essays in Ethics of Rhetoric. Although Burke may have sensed his case\nagainst Weaver was not strong \u2013 the letter was more venom than reasoning \u2013 there are similarities in the\nschemes.\n62 ideologies that feature material fact.\nOthers in argumentation have pondered the relationship between ideology and\nargument. As early as 1979, G. Thomas Goodnight (1980) made the case for variation in\nargument tied to political positions and posited the difficulties presented by such\ndifferences in argument on the public sphere. Goodnight focused on the term\n\u201cpresumption\u201d and traced how political position could influence the meaning of that term\n(see also Hynes, 1980). Six years later, David Cratis Williams (1985) made the link\nbetween ideology and argument explicit in his essay, \u201cIdeological Analogons: Portraits of\n\u2018Truth\u2019.\u201d Several others have identified style of argument with particular political\npositions.\nThe popular linkage of conservatives to the attack on facts can now be placed into\na more sophisticated understanding of our historical moment. The institutions we have\nhistorically located as dominating the 20th century provided a texture of material fact that\nsupported the New Deal, the dominant political ideology of the fifty years from Franklin\nD. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan. The Conservative ascendance that Reagan began would\nattain power only as it eroded the institutions that supplied the material facts that justified\nNew Deal programs. In our historical moment, the conservatives did attack the\ninstitutions of fact, but the attack was not an attack on facts, per se, but on the material\nfacts that fueled the arguments of those whom they opposed politically.\n4. A Public Sphere without Institutions of Fact\nIn a democracy, controversy and argument have the burden of peacefully adapting\nthe society to the changes of circumstances and the changes of values that mark human\nhistory. Such argument crosses the political divides of a society; the reach of\ncommonality permits the adjudication of argumentative controversy into perceived\nconsensus. If there are no remaining institutions of fact, is our fate an argumentative\nrudderlessness? Or, as our red/blue obsession implies, is this political polarization that we\nendure destined to become a societal polarization that cannot be reconciled because the\n\u201ccommon ground\u201d necessary to argue our way back to consensus cannot be achieved?\nThe United States suffered such a fate in the 19th century when the democratic,\nargumentative, public sphere could not resolve the problem of slavery. That failing led to\nthe sort of societal anomie that we witness in other cultures today and, of course, to the\nCivil War. Certainly the dimensions of our problem today, despite their seriousness, do\nnot compare with that failure.\nThis is, however, a problem that those of us working in argumentation and in the\ndemocratic public sphere must continue to address. We are now in a time when the\ninstitutions that have for a century provided our civic culture reliable starting points for\nargument are no longer viable. The result is a malfunctioning of the consensus that can\ndrive rhetorical argument in a smoothly functioning democratic community.\nOf course, identifying a challenge to address this problem does not predicate an\nobvious response. As our civic culture searches for common grounds to bring the anomie\nof the moment back toward a productive consensus, the argumentation community\u2019s\ncontribution must be to understand more thoroughly such historical moments of\nbreakdown when foundations fail and argument\u2019s power to promote peaceful democratic\nchange is challenged. We have endured many such times in our history and have survived\nwith considerably more success than at the time of the Civil War.\n63 Is our argumentation theory itself at fault? Despite the classical origins of our\nmodel of argument , reasoning from agreed upon premises, should this model of starting\n1\npoints in agreement be replaced by a model that recognizes times when such agreements\nare rarer and are identified with greater effort? Do we need some variation of Stephen\nToulmin\u2019s (1958) distinction between warrant-using and warrant-establishing\narguments,8 with the latter identified as the need for our time of anomie? Perhaps, we\nneed to take our cue from Cha\u00efm Perelman and L. Olbrecht-Tyteca\u2019s (1958/1969) starting\npoints beyond facts, thus exploring presumptions and values as the starting places of\nargument. Should we explore more thoroughly the notion of facts itself as a key concept?\nRobert Scott (1968) began this philosophical and historical exploration some four\ndecades ago in his examination of the rhetoric of Arthur Larson and the USIA. Or\nperhaps, there are new institutions of fact forming before our eyes but out of our sight\nthat will once again permit us to proceed in a more orderly development of public\ndirection. In the best tradition of argumentative study, the challenge is a practical one.\nWhatever the solution to the problem we confront as students of argument, we\nwill respond successfully only with the greatest care to examine all of our assumptions\nabout argument: critical, historical, and theoretical. And the success of our rhetorical\nculture will depend on the paths that we pursue and what they reveal about how a society\nconducts democratic argument to guide its actions through the difficulties of public life.\nReferences\nAgnew, S.

Lane Bruner\nGeorgia State University\nmbruner@gsu.edu\nAbstract: By placing in dialogue lectures delivered by Edmund Husserl, Jacques Derrida, and\nChaim Perelman on the rational and the reasonable, this essay identifies some of the universal,\nhence rational, dimensions of reason, or the contours of meta-reason. By identifying the rational\ndimensions of the reasonable, we are better positioned conceptually as argumentation theorists to\naddress the primary argumentative mechanisms of political transformation: essentialism and\nrhetorical unconsciousness.\nKey Words: Argumentation Theory, Politics, Rationality, Reason, Unconsciousness\nIn his Nichomachean Ethics, Aristotle made clear that different types of knowledge allow\nfor different degrees of certainty. Epistemic knowledge, or the knowledge of math and science,\nmay be certain, while practical wisdom, or knowledge of law and politics, may only be probable.\nEpistemic knowledge, accordingly, recommends itself to formal, syllogistic reasoning, where\nconclusions are logically entailed. Knowledge in practical human affairs, conversely, requires the\nartful deployment of informal reasoning, long studied by argument theorists. Thus, with its\nfoundation in Aristotle, argumentation theory has for millennia distinguished the rational from\nthe reasonable, and certain from probable knowledge. A pressing question across the ages,\ntherefore, concerns how those two forms of knowledge interact in the construction of our\npolitical worlds, for it is normal to find presumed certainty in political situations. If the certain\nand the probable are separate in theory, this is not so clearly the case in practice. So what is the\nrelationship between the rational and the reasonable, and how might this relationship impact\nargumentation theory in relation to the political?\nPutting in dialogue representative philosophical arguments on the rational and the\nreasonable, specifically public lectures by Edmund Husserl, Jacques Derrida, and Chaim\nPerelman, this essay seeks to explore what J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Derrida have respectively\ncalled meta-rationality or meta-reason. By placing these arguments in dialogue with the very\ndifferent philosophies of history of Georg W. F. Hegel and Michel Foucault, and the different\ntheories of political transformation those philosophies entail, Husserl\u2019s, Derrida\u2019s, and\nPerelman\u2019s characterizations of the rational and the reasonable suggest that the primary problem\nof the political revolves around the related issues of essentialism and rhetorical unconsciousness,\nor the broadly unrecognized aspects of presumed certainties in the probable world of the\npolitical, which, while driving its transformation, are doomed over time to fail. As Ernesto\nLaclau (2005) and Judith Butler (2002) have persuasively shown, the application of universals in\nthe realm of the probable always results formally in exceptions that ultimately undermine those\npresumed universals, and all too often through violence. Such perspectives on the rational and\nthe reasonable, as well as on the universal and the particular, have, I argue, implications for\nargument theory and practice, since the focus would shift from analyzing not only the content of\nsituated arguments but also rhetorical unconsciousness.\n68 It is not controversial, given the direction of critical theory since Immanuel Kant\u2019s\n([1781]/1965) Critique of Pure Reason, where he characterizes the ineradicable distance between\nthought and material reality, to claim that the fundamental support of political society is provided\nby politically consequential quasi-fictions posing as universal truths (e.g., the divine right of\nkings, state sovereignty, corporate personhood).1 Such presumed certainties work to structure\npolitical society while also often providing a reassuring sense of subjective certainty, or\n\u201cmetaphysical comfort,\u201d to borrow Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s (1967: 104) evocative phrase. It is,\nhowever, logically and formally the case that those acting upon these universalizing beliefs fail\nto account for their disciplinary limits, or their own rhetorical unconsciousness, thus imposing an\nultimately inappropriate rationality on the realm of the reasonable and the probable.\nWhat, though, do these metaphysically comforting quasi-fictions have to do with political\ntransformation? Two influential accounts, though quite different, have been offered by Hegel and\nFoucault. As Hegel would have it, the certain and the probable, the universal and the particular,\ninteract in such a way that a trans-intentional force guides the seeming irrationality of political\nhistory. Hegel ([1836]/1900) maintained the existence of a \u201cMessianic\u201d meta-rationality, or a\ntype of transcendental rational force that somehow manages the blindnesses involved in human\nintentionality. \u201cReason,\u201d for Hegel, was synonymous with \u201cSpirit\u201d working trans-intentionally\nthrough world history, regardless of the specific intentions of individuals and collectives. As\nexpressed in his ([1837]/1953) lectures on the role of Reason in history, Hegel famously\nmaintained that \u201cthe universal results from the particular and the definite and its negation,\u201d and\nthe \u201ccunning of Reason\u201d is that Idea, or Spirit, that invisibly guides world history in ways that\nare beyond the comprehension of humankind (43).2 Over time, the moral political state, through\na difficult and painful dialectical process between universal ideas and particular events, more\nclosely approximates the freedom of Spirit.\nA much different perspective on political transformation is offered by Foucault, who\nconsistently maintained that the political world is always violently limited, if enjoyably\nproduced, by the blindnesses of political certainties. Foucault (1984; 2001), contra Hegel, argued\nthat our political worlds do not progress, though sometimes people bravely speak truth to\nrepressive power to clarify injustice and test virtue; instead, what often passes for commonsense\nreveals itself, upon closer examination, as unreason. For example, in his History of Madness,\nwhich is more properly translated as the History of Unreason, Foucault ([1972]/2006) goes to\ngreat lengths to trace the history of the idea of madness and its ever-changing normative and\ninstitutional forms. In so doing, he reveals how what counts as reason and unreason shifts \u2013 and\nquite dramatically \u2013 over the course of centuries. Madness in parts of the ancient world, for\nexample, was associated with divine inspiration, whereas today it is medicalized. His\nprovocative conclusion: madness is a politically consequential concept formed to protect the\nunreason of hegemonic reason itself.3 As all human society is based upon politically\n1 The political, as with the subjective, according to the strands of post-Kantian thought explored in this essay, is\ncomposed of \u201cquasi-fictions,\u201d which are the inevitable consequence of the fully ineradicable disjuncture between the\nideal and the real. They are quasi-fictions because they have concrete material effects, which is why they are\npolitical.\n2 For a thorough description of Hegel\u2019s philosophy of history, see Walter Kaufmann (1978), especially pages 249-\n97.\n3 In the early nineteenth century, for example, as a fully unconscious means to reassure the Parisian bourgeoisie of\ntheir own sanity, the Abb\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois de Coulmier, as director of Charenton, the lunatic asylum on the southern edge\nof Paris, created a regularly organized spectacle where the presumably insane would put on plays, viewed by the\nother inmates, who in turn were viewed from the gallery by paying bourgeois customers. This \u201cdouble reassurance\u201d\n69 consequential quasi-fictions whose own forms of madness are sublimated and repressed,\nFoucault asserts that what passes for reason moves from one form of \u201cproductive\u201d domination to\nthe next without end.4 In light of his historical analyses of presumed certainties about such\nthings as madness and sexuality, Foucault (1984) was led to the claim that \u201conly a single drama\nis ever staged . . . [which is] the endlessly repeated play of dominations,\u201d and that this endlessly\nrepeated play is also a \u201ccalculated and relentless pleasure\u201d (85).\nHow might we work to reconcile, if such reconciliation is even possible, Hegel\u2019s and\nFoucault\u2019s positions on political transformation, and how might such a reconciliation inform\nargumentation theory in relation to the political? To begin answering these two questions, it is\nhelpful to place three well-known lectures by philosophers on the rational and the reasonable\nside by side: Husserl\u2019s 1935 lecture, delivered during the \u201cflowering\u201d of National Socialism in\nEurope, on \u201cPhilosophy and the Crisis of European Man,\u201d where he sought to \u201csave the honor of\nrationality\u201d through the \u201cheroism of reason;\u201d Perelman\u2019s 1977 lecture entitled \u201cThe Rational and\nthe Reasonable,\u201d where he attempted to characterize the \u201cdialectic\u201d between the rational and the\nreasonable; and Derrida\u2019s 2002 keynote address at a conference on \u201cThe Future of Reason, the\nDevelopment of Rationalities,\u201d where he sought to \u201csave the honor of reason.\u201d Together, these\nlectures suggest a great deal about the relationship between rational and reasonable, the contours\nof meta-reason, and political transformation. Though they often talk at cross purposes by using\n\u201creason\u201d and \u201crationality\u201d equivocally (only Perelman has the precise Aristotelian account), by\nclarifying such confusions we can take what is now broadly known formally about identity\nconstruction in general, via the linguistic turn, and apply that knowledge to a more contemporary\nphilosophical conception of political transformation and argumentation analysis.5\nAs the shadow of Hitler\u2019s Germany, cast by its presumed certainties, was falling\nmenacingly across Europe, the Jewish-born Husserl delivered a lecture in Vienna on May 10,\n1935 where he expressed his concern about what he called the \u201cmistaken\u201d and \u201cna\u00efve\u201d\nrationalism, the \u201cone-sided rationality\u201d of \u201cobjectivism\u201d (1935: 13-14). This \u201cirrational\nobjectivism,\u201d this \u201ctechnical rationality,\u201d or this form of rationality used by branches of inquiry\nthat fail to account for the broader social and political implications of their advancement,\naccording to Husserl, was at the root of the European crisis he was witnessing. This was because\nthe methods of the natural sciences were na\u00efvely and mistakenly taken to apply to the \u201cmysteries\nof the spirit.\u201d After fully assessing the crisis, Husserl concluded that \u201cIn all seriousness my\nopinion is this: there never has nor ever will be an objective science of spirit\u201d (17).\nBut what is this notion of spirit, and what might an \u201cobjective science of spirit\u201d look like?\nHusserl uses the term Geisteswissenchaften, or \u201csciences of the spirit,\u201d which he equates with\n\u201cculture\u201d (3). From the perspective of contemporary subjectivity studies, however, we can\ntranslate Husserl\u2019s use of the term \u201cspirit\u201d as referring to what today would be called more\nprecisely, and less metaphysically, the realm of discourse (i.e., the realm of human experience\n\u2013 of the presumably sane watching the mad watch the mad \u2013 nicely illustrates Foucault\u2019s central point that what\npasses for reason is reassured by pleasurably imposed yet repressed forms of unreason. See Foucault ([1972]/2006),\n144-5.\n4 Foucault\u2019s perspective here resonates with Freud\u2019s ([1930]/1961), as Freud also maintained that civilization is\nbased on the repression of instinct, and yet that very repression is variously productive.\n5 For the purposes of this essay, the linguistic turn refers to the influence of Saussure\u2019s semiotic theory on\nstructuralism, post-structuralism, and contemporary conceptions of subjectivity emerging from linguistics. For a\nrange of perspectives on this work and its influence on philosophical approaches to the political, see Dews (1987);\nFink (1995); Torfing (1999); and Stavrakakis (1999).\n70 that results from our entrance into, and subsequent use of, language).6 Husserl\u2019s own words\ninvite a translation of \u201cspirit\u201d as communication: \u201cWith the first conception of ideas man\ngradually becomes a new man. His spiritual being enters into the movement of a progressive\nreformation. This movement from the very beginning involves communication\u201d (5). The\n\u201cspiritual,\u201d then, for Husserl, involves our immersion into language, and thus communication,\nfrom the very beginning, and any \u201cobjective science of the spirit\u201d would necessarily be based on\nthis linguistic foundation. Nevertheless, Husserl despaired of such a science.\nIn the intervening years, however, and in light of the large body of work on subjectivity\nby semioticians, structuralists and poststructuralists in the philosophy of language, and critical\npolitical theory, we now arguably have a far more complete understanding of how the process of\nhuman communication works, and, as a result, a much better sense of the potential violence of\nessentialism in sign systems that are formally \u201cshot through with absence.\u201d7\nSo what, according to Husserl, was the relationship between \u201cthe spirit\u201d and the crisis in\nworld history he was witnessing? The content of his lecture suggests that the central problem he\nwanted to address was the application of the field-specific rationalities of disciplinary knowledge\nto \u201cthe totality of being,\u201d pointing particularly to the problematic \u201cna\u00efvet\u00e9\u201d of \u201cobjectivism.\u201d\nThere was something \u201cblind\u201d about field-specific thinking that, in its rationality, was also\nunreasonable and generally unnoticed. Sometimes the consequences of one\u2019s rational actions\nwere out of mind, and of course other field-specific understandings were also out of mind. This\n\u201cout of mind\u201d dimension of the rational was, for Husserl, overwhelming the possibilities for\npolitical reason, or what Aristotle referred to as the knowledge required for practical wisdom.\nBut notice in the following quote Husserl\u2019s curious blending of the rational and the reasonable \u2013\na problem that persists throughout his lecture. After noting, almost in passing, that \u201creason is a\nbroad title,\u201d he states the following:\nThe direct and necessary path for reason allows it initially to grasp only one aspect of the\ntask, at first without recognizing that a thorough knowledge of the entire infinite task, the\ntotality of being, involves still other aspects. When inadequacy reveals itself in\nobscurities and contradiction, then this becomes a motive to engage in a universal\nreflection (14).\nSo \u201creason\u201d initially, according to Husserl, lacking a meta-perspective on knowledge production,\nmerely grasps narrow perspectives (e.g., the field specific arguments of scientific disciplines,\none\u2019s own cultural commonsense, one\u2019s given sense of a term) as universals, but contradictions\nthen, at least potentially, lead to more broadly universal thinking. This, however, is inconsistent\nwith Aristotle\u2019s position, where it is rationality that lacks the \u201cbroader perspective\u201d provided by\npractical wisdom, which is the realm of the probable, of rhetoric, and hence of reason.\n6 To trace adequately the theoretical history of semiotics, structuralism and poststructuralism is obviously not\npossible here, though I shall briefly return to aspects of this history in my discussion of Derrida. For those seeking\nan introduction to this important theoretical history, see Belsey (2002). The primary consequential principle of\npolitical importance involved in semiotics is that all identity is a function of difference. In Lacanian psychoanalytics\nit becomes a complexly repressed function. Also, whereas structuralists attempt to understand the primary element\nor elements that structure the structures of human meaning, poststructuralists maintain that all subjectivity is\nstructured around an ultimately irremediable lack (Lacan) or absence (Derrida). Argumentation theorists, however,\nas I hope to show, are uniquely equipped to show how that \u201clack\u201d is actually filled, at least in part, with repressed\ndiscursive contents, functioning as rhetorical unconsciousness.\n7 Essentialism here is used in the following sense: the belief that a subject\u2019s or group\u2019s identity stays stable over time\nand circumstance, or has some sort of persistent essence.\n71 There are interesting affinities, despite such confusions over what, precisely, is rational\nand what, precisely, is reasonable, between Husserl\u2019s characterizations and the poststructural\nproblematic of the relationship between the universal and the particular, such as Laclau and\nChantal Mouffe\u2019s (1985) theory of hegemony and antagonisms and Laclau\u2019s (1996) notion of the\nuniversal, the particular, and political identity. Compare, for example, Husserl\u2019s claim to Laclau\nand Mouffe\u2019s argument that the universal/essentialist claims of \u201cscientific\u201d Marxism (arguably a\nclear example of the tragic political consequences of essentialist assumptions in the necessarily\ncontingent realm of the political), via their falsification over time, led to the recognition that\nhistory does not inevitably lead from feudalism to capitalism to communism and that forms of\nproduction do not determine the cultural superstructure. Instead, the role of communication in\nthe construction of hegemony becomes the central problematic in effective socialist strategy. In\nsum, just as Husserl is concerned about the \u201cone sided rationality\u201d of scientism, Laclau and\nMouffe are concerned about the way essentialist assumptions in the realm of the political always\ncreate a field of antagonisms that eventually transform those assumptions. In this way, Laclau\nand Mouffe, resonant with Husserl, attempt to retrieve a form of practical political wisdom from\na misplaced rationalism, and in so doing they also identify a universal dimension of rationality in\nthe realm of reason: all identities create consequential antagonistic fields that go largely\nunrecognized.\nWe can draw, then, upon Aristotle\u2019s initial distinction between the rational and the\nreasonable, and Hegel\u2019s and Husserl\u2019s idiosyncratic use of the latter term in light of that\nepistemology, to begin articulating other formal, rational principles embedded in practical reason\n(i.e., the principles of meta-reason), to more carefully distinguish the important differences and\nsimilarities between the two terms, to outline the contours of meta-reason, and then discuss how\nthose contours might productively inform argumentation theory today.\nObserve the following formal, universal, aspects of practical wisdom we have already\nencountered: wise deliberation in the realm of politics (the good state) and ethics (the good life)\nalways deals with the variable, and presumed universals always exclude that which fails to fall\ninto line with those presumed universals. This problem is particularly clear in the case of\ntechnical rationality, where those engaged in highly specific disciplinary practices, such as bomb\ndesign, are conceptually detached from the larger social consequences of bombs. The same\nprinciple applies, however, to anyone who falsely believes that their culture is the culture, such\nas religiously-driven terrorists. Technical rationality and identity essentialism both formally\ncreate antagonistic limits that are normally repressed and/or alien to hegemonic discourses.\nBefore moving to Derrida\u2019s attempt to \u201csave the honor of reason,\u201d as opposed to\nHusserl\u2019s attempt to \u201csave the honor of rationality,\u201d and further exploring the rational aspects of\nreason, we should at least briefly attend to the concrete historical situation that led to Husserl\u2019s\ndark observations: obviously, everywhere he looked across Europe, but especially in Germany,\nhe saw highly specialized technocrats and self-blinded ideologues imposing their \u201cuniversals\u201d\nand presumed certainties (e.g., of the master race) onto the political world. In so doing, they were\ndirectly contributing, even if unwittingly, to the violent chaos that would bloody the first half of\nthe twentieth century. Husserl was undoubtedly correct, therefore, to argue that the world needed\na \u201cscience of spirit\u201d capable of assessing the \u201chealth and sickness\u201d of \u201cnations and international\ncommunities\u201d (2), and that the \u201cspirit\u201d from the very beginning involves communication, though\nwe might perhaps question his prediction that, should such a science emerge, a \u201csupernationality\nof a completely new kind could arise\u201d (12). After all, a theoretical understanding of meta-reason\nis not the same as expecting meta-reason from the world\u2019s citizens; that is, it is foolish to expect\n72 at the present moment a self-reflective understanding of the constitutive and unconsciously\ndisciplinary dimensions of language in use among the majority of the world\u2019s population. This is\nprecisely why there is a pressing need for argument theories and methodological approaches that\naddress such constitutive and unconscious conditions.\nAs for Derrida (2003), he attempted to answer Husserl\u2019s call for a \u201crational\u201d approach to\nthe health of nations and the broader global political community through his attempt to \u201csave the\nhonor of reason,\u201d specifically through his notion of \u201cdeconstructive justice.\u201d8 Summarizing the\nthesis of his lecture, Derrida stated that in order for \u201ccalculative rationality\u201d to be \u201creasonable\u201d it\nwould have to recognize the role of the incalculable in events that are to come. Here, as opposed\nto Husserl\u2019s \u201csynchronic concerns\u201d about the alienating differences between people overly\nengaged in micro-discourses we have Derrida\u2019s \u201cdiachronic concerns\u201d about the alienating\ndifferences between people experiencing future challenges to their presumed certainties. As with\nall characterizations of meta-reason, however, he too argues for the indispensable ability to gain\na contextual distance from the taken-for-granted assumptions of particular disciplinary or\nideological perspectives that assume a universal status. It is not, he points out, that we can rid\nourselves of universals, since they are the very stuff of the ideal, but we must always be eager, in\norder to be reasonable, to have the limits of those universals, in light of ever-emerging particular\nevents, openly exposed and challenged, which is precisely what ideologues, tyrants, and true\nbelievers generally refuse to do. As one symptomatic consequence of such refusals, repressed\ndiscursive fields tend to expand, constituting a central aspect of rhetorical unconsciousness that\nargumentation theorists can work to identify.\nDerrida\u2019s work has been interpreted, as a result of superficial readings, as being hostile to\nconcrete political concerns, let alone to the role of argument in those concerns, since\ndeconstruction is often equated with the postmodern attempt to undermine all universalizing\nnarratives that might be brought bear in organizing political society (Lyotard, 1984). In a series\nof debates with Richard Rorty, Simon Critchley, and Laclau and Mouffe on the relationship\nbetween deconstruction and pragmatism, however, Derrida (1996) makes a series of claims\nregarding argumentation that challenge such presumed hostility. Not only, he insists, are critics\nwho reproach deconstructionists for not arguing, or for not appreciating the foundational\nimportance of argumentation, engaging in nothing less than \u201cdefamation,\u201d in fact the precise\nopposite is the case: \u201cthe question of argumentation,\u201d he emphasizes, is \u201ccentral\u201d to his overall\nphilosophical project. Indeed, Derrida claims he is interested in nothing less than \u201craising the\nstakes of argumentation\u201d (78, emphasis added). How so?\nFor Derrida, who draws heavily on structural linguistics, particularly as described by\nSaussure, all identity, formed through language, is necessarily, because of the formal aspects of\nlanguage, a function of difference. Just as letters and words have no meaning in and of\nthemselves, save for their relative position among other letters and words, so it is with concepts\nand the forms of subjectivity composed of those concepts. Who we \u201care\u201d as individuals and\ngroups, in other words, is a function of the relations of difference in which we find ourselves at\n8 For a helpful introduction to Derrida\u2019s notion of deconstruction, or the methodological displacement of the\nunconscious dimensions of identities/equivalencies in language (both synchronically and diachronically), see Bannet\n(1989), chapter four. See Derrida (1984) for his original account of the term.\n73 any given moment in time, rather than some transcendental essence.9 This does not mean,\nhowever, that these relations of difference are immaterial; rather, they \u201cfloat\u201d in materially\nconsequential ways over a sea of chaos and are endlessly being reconstructed.\nFor Derrida, the \u201cviolence\u201d of imposing identity, which entails quasi-fictional certainty,\nis \u201cin fact irreducible,\u201d and \u201call that a deconstructive point of view tries to show, is that since\nconventions, institutions and consensus are stabilizations . . . this means that they are\nstabilizations of something essentially unstable and chaotic\u201d (83). This is why all identities, all\n\u201cforced\u201d equivalences, whether individual or collective, are political, for the essence of the\npolitical is the necessity of making materially consequential decisions, taking irretrievable\nactions, in an ultimately undecidable terrain. All identity, therefore all human meaning-making,\naccording to Derrida, is a forced unity over an ever-shifting field of differences, and decisions\nbased on patterns of identification are haunted by the differences they fail to take into account.\nDerrida (2003) maintains, therefore, that we need \u201cto develop a new conception of reason\u201d that\nwill \u201cchallenge not only the sovereignty and identity of the (human) subject but the very\nconcepts of sovereignty and identity . . . [for] only this way can we \u2018save the honor of reason\u2019\u201d\n(9). Derrida, then, like Hegel, Husserl, Foucault, Laclau, Mouffe and others, has made the case\nfor the existence of rational principles concerning practical wisdom and a rhetorical\nunconsciousness, or fields of either unknown or repressed discourses that \u201chaunt\u201d identities, that\nresult from these rational principles.\nSo what are these rational principles, according to Derrida, that always should be taken\ninto account, at least by those capable of doing so, if seeking to engage in wise deliberation on\nthe political? What does this have to do with \u201craising the stakes of argumentation\u201d? Before\noffering possible answers to those questions, note that Derrida, like Husserl, at least in\ntranslation, also collapses the terms rational and reasonable in less than helpful ways, and this\ntends to occlude the very point he wants to make about \u201cdeconstructive justice:\u201d it is a form of\nmeta-reason that recognizes, and then works to consciously deal with, the necessary tension\nbetween rational, universalizing systems of thought and law and the irruptive and incalculable\nforce of particular events to come. Exemplifying this conceptual confusion, in his summation of\nHusserl\u2019s position, Derrida argues that \u201cscientific reason, in its very progress, spontaneously\nproduces [a] crisis. It is reason that throws reason into crisis, in an autonomous and quasi-auto-\nimmunitary fashion,\u201d and that \u201cobjectivist irrationalism [is] born on the inside of reason itself\u201d\n(19, emphasis added). As with Husserl, science is inappropriately associated with reason, at least\ninappropriately when positioned within Aristotle\u2019s epistemology, which clearly associates\nscience with rationality. Even so, a closer look at Derrida\u2019s attempt to \u201csave the honor of reason\u201d\nhelps us, as argumentation theorists, to more carefully study the role of essentialism across time\n(i.e., the assumption that identities remain stable across time and circumstance) in the political.\nIn his attempt to save the honor of \u201creason,\u201d Derrida, unlike Husserl, is concerned\nprimarily with the force of law, which leads him to engage in a critical analysis of Walter\nBenjamin\u2019s ([1921]/1978) discussion of the violence of law in the latter\u2019s \u201cCritique of Violence.\u201d\nBenjamin\u2019s main point in that essay was to defend the claim that all law making and all law\npreserving actions formally constitute a two-fold violence: law is always established by force,\nand then that law must always be enforced. Building upon Benjamin\u2019s thoughts on the violence\nof law, political justice for Derrida always requires a moment of decision that creatively applies\n9 This is the opposite of Platonic idealism, where the presumed transcendental essence is always deemed superior to\nthe material instantiation, which in turn is superior to the re-presentation of the material via language, which in turn\nis superior to \u201crhetoric\u201d and \u201cpoetry,\u201d which tend to distort Truth.\n74 the law to endlessly unique circumstances, as opposed to the cold and calculated (rational)\napplication of law that fails to take such circumstances into account. True justice, like true\ndemocracy, therefore, is always \u201cto come,\u201d for once a decision is made, and a new legal order is\nestablished, that order invariably contains the seeds of injustice if it too fails to account for the\nunique and incalculable aspects of the unique and particular aspects of what is to come. Once\nagain, with Derrida we see a call for a form of meta-reason made possible by the achievement of\ndistance from essentialist deployments of language: in this case, in light of the recognized\nviolence of law, the meta-reflective ability to adapt the universal prescriptions of law to the\nunfolding particulars of concrete situations.\nReturning briefly to Foucault (1984), he too speaks on behalf of meta-reason, since his\nconception, as articulated in his essay \u201cWhat is Enlightenment,\u201d which is an echo of Kant\u2019s\nfamous essay by the same title, also requires a \u201climit attitude,\u201d or a meta-reflexive ability to\nincessantly critique the limits imposed on us by identities, laws, and systems of thought \u2013 as\nstructuring fictions (50). Compare Derrida\u2019s (2003) description of what he calls \u201cthe reasonable\u201d\nwith Foucault\u2019s (1984) description of the \u201climit attitude.\u201d For Derrida, the reasonable is a\n\u201crational deconstruction that will endlessly question limits and presuppositions, [and] the\ninterests and calculations that order their deployment\u201d (42). Foucault (1984) makes a similar\npoint in different words:\nThe critical ontology of ourselves . . . has to be conceived as an attitude, an ethos, a\nphilosophical life in which the critique of what we are is at one and the same time the\nhistorical analysis of the limits that are imposed on us and an experiment with the\npossibility of going beyond them (50).\nFor both Derrida and Foucault, then, there are inescapable and universally problematic tensions\nbetween existing normative frameworks that pose as universals and the limits they formally and\nunconsciously impose. This, then, \u201craises the stakes of argumentation\u201d by doubling its charge:\nnot only must we analyze normative frameworks, we must also analyze what they unconsciously\n(or cynically) repress or elide.10\nHusserl and Derrida, then, if in very different ways and through different analytical\nprocedures, and despite their odd conflations of the rational and the reasonable, are each\nconcerned about the dangerous essentialist notion that socially constructed truth can somehow\nstand still or reach a state of timelessness. They are also concerned about gaining the ability to\nachieve distance from one\u2019s given language, and this notion of \u201cself-distancing\u201d as part and\nparcel of meta-reason is expressed in a variety of ways. Husserl and Derrida, as we have seen,\nfocus in part on the problems of technical rationality, in part on the violence of law, and in part\non the larger unintentional chaos such forms of rationality or essentialism cause. A similar\nconcern was expressed as early as 1795 by Friedrich Schiller, in his classic work On the\nAesthetic Education of Man, where he noted the following:\nAs soon as enlarged experience and more precise speculation made necessary a sharper\ndivision of the sciences on the one hand, and on the other, the more intricate machinery\nof the States made necessary a more rigorous dissociation of ranks and occupations, the\nessential bond of human nature was torn apart, and a ruinous conflict set its harmonious\npowers at variance (39).\n10 On cynical repression, or \u201cenlightened false consciousness,\u201d as opposed to formal or structural repression, see\nSloterdijk (1987). For a detailed Lacanian account of the formal repressions entailed in our entrance into language,\nsee Lemaire (1970).\n75 John Dewey ([1927]/1954) as well was concerned about the unconscious aspects of self-\ninterested actions that cause unintentional secondary effects, particularly in a socio-political\nworld becoming increasingly complex. According to Dewey, the \u201cpublic\u201d is nothing less than the\nsum total of the indirect consequences of conjoint action, and it is only by becoming conscious\nof these otherwise unconscious consequences that we can build proper institutions. In sum, in a\nworld filled with specialists, there are few with the capacity to step back, as rhetoricians have for\nmillennia, and grasp complex issues from the multiple perspectives of those involved in those\nissues.\nEven if we return to Aristotle and define reason as practical wisdom in the realm of the\nprobable, this does not mean, as I have attempted to show, that there are not formal, rational (i.e.,\nuniversally applicable and certain) dimensions to the production of social reason, and these\nrational dimensions constitute the contours of meta-reason. By way of introducing how these\nrational aspects of reason are relevant to argumentation theory, Butler (2002) speaks in the\nfollowing terms:\nTo claim that the universal has not yet been articulated is to insist that the \u2018not yet\u2019 is\nproper to an understanding of the universal itself: that which remains \u2018unrealized\u2019 by the\nuniversal constitutes it essentially. The universal begins to become articulated precisely\nthrough challenges to its existing formation (48).\nIn plainer terms, it is the falsification of presumed certainties by ever-unfolding particulars that\nin fact constitutes a universal aspect of practical wisdom. Another way this has been put, as we\nhave seen with Husserl and Derrida, is to say that practical reason, in order not to ignore its\nformal, universal qualities, must always forego assumptions that are not open both to the limits\nthey necessarily impose or to the events to come that will incessantly challenge different\npresumed certainties. Thus we turn back one final time to Husserl\u2019s point that technical\nrationality, with its necessarily unquestioned major premises and topic-specific entailed\nconclusions, and to Foucault and Derrida\u2019s point that presumed certainties about madness,\nsexuality, law and other structuring fictions are necessarily transformed by the historical\nparticulars they inevitably encounter.11 Technical rationality and ideological certainty both entail\nrepressed discursive fields, with unconscious synchronic and diachronic dimensions, which\nindeed create a real material force.\nThe notion that practical wisdom formally revolves around a constellation of repressed\ndiscursive elements, or more abstractly a void or absence, also resonates with psychoanalytical\naccounts based on the work of Lacan who, like Derrida, was also profoundly influenced by\nSaussure. For Lacan, a universal dimension of all identity formations is the void around which\nthey form, since, ala Derrida, the center of all structures is a formal, structuring absence, or\nlack.12 So, for Lacan and Derrida, a constitutive lack is another important universal, hence\nrational, aspect of all political thought.13\n11 The opposite position would be to suggest that out of the chaos of self-interest something akin to an \u201cinvisible\nhand\u201d guides society and the economy toward reason. For my extended critique of such a position, see Bruner\n(2009). For another take on the history of the idea of the virtue of self-interest, see Hirschman (1977).\n12 Derrida\u2019s classic statement on the structuring absences at the heart of any meaningful system of signs, a statement\nthat arguably inaugurated the transition from structuralism to post-structuralism, is found in his essay \u201cStructure,\nSign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences.\u201d See Derrida (1978). Again, my ultimate claim is that\nargumentation scholars are uniquely positioned to show how these \u201cabsences\u201d are mappable repressed discursive\nfields displaying different symptoms.\n13 Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (1983), who are hostile to Freudian and neo-Freudian psychoanalytics, express\nthis idea as \u201cproductive\u201d lack as follows: \u201cDesire does not lack anything; it does not lack its object. It is, rather, the\n76 Hegemonic, totalizing, disciplinary discourses \u2013 and there is always a constellation of\nsuch discourses at work in any given socio-political situation, no matter how artfully considered\n\u2013 always inscribe limits that necessarily antagonize attitudes, beliefs, and actions falling outside\nof those limits. As particular events over the course of time encounter those limits, contradictions\nemerge between the normative justifications that support those structuring fictions and the\nconcrete actions of those who defend, oftentimes in increasingly anachronistic ways, the limits\nthey impose consciously and unconsciously. As contradictions pile up, modification in the\nstructuring discourses are required if political violence is to be held at bay. If this account of\npolitical subjectivity is accurate, and hence formally and rationally true, then argumentation\ntheorists should also focus on the friction among structuring fictions, their unrecognized or\nrepressed limits, and the various ways those limits are productively or unproductively\ntransgressed.14\nWe can see, therefore, that meta-reason is based on the rational, formal, and potentially\nemancipatory principle that all totalizing discourses, when those who employ them are unaware\nof the limits they impose, are not open to the incalculable events to come, and are not aware of\nthe logical impossibility of full subjectivity, move against the spirit of enlightenment (Tully,\n2003). A reactionary discourse, conversely, is one that seeks to strengthen the limits of a\nstructuring fiction while weakening the capacity of individuals to productively question and test\nthose limits. What, however, might an \u201cemancipatory\u201d discourse look like, if all discourses are\nconstituted around an inevitable lack no particular presumptions can solve? To explore one\npossible answer to this question, I now turn to Chaim Perelman.\nAs Perelman (1979) noted in his important essay on the rational and the reasonable, these\nare anything but interchangeable terms, and his characterization of the distinction between them\nclearly resonates with Aristotle\u2019s.\nThe rational corresponds to mathematical reason, for some a reflection of divine reason,\nwhich grasps the necessary relations, which knows a priori, certain self-evident and\nimmutable truths, which is at the same time individual and universal; because by being\nrevealed within a single mind, it imposes its themes on all beings of reason; because it\nowes nothing to experience or to dialogue, and depends neither on education nor on the\nculture of a milieu or an epoch (213).\nReason, conversely, is bound to time and circumstance and cannot be fully rational, and this is\nwhy, Perelman agues, combining the rational and the reasonable in politics is disastrous\nbusiness. Echoing Hegel\u2019s, Derrida\u2019s, Laclau\u2019s, and Butler\u2019s emphasis on the problematic\nrelationship between presumed political certainties and particular events over time that\nnecessarily problematize those presumptions, Perelman emphasizes how rules of political action\nmay appear \u201cself-evident at one moment or in a given situation,\u201d but they \u201ccan seem arbitrary\nand even ridiculous at another moment and in a different situation\u201d (215).\nAfter providing his initial characterization of the rational and the reasonable, Perelman\nthen turns to what he terms \u201cthe unreasonable exercise of power,\u201d and here is where things\nbecome particularly interesting given our focus on meta-reason and political transformation. He\nsubject that is missing in desire, or desire that lacks a fixed subject; there is no fixed subject unless there is\nrepression\u201d (26, emphasis added). For useful introductions to Lacan, see Lemaire (1977), McGowan (2013), and\nStavrakakis (1999).\n14 For methodological procedures appropriate to aspects of this task, see Bruner (2002; 2012). As the rhetorical\nunconscious is not in the text, since its content is variously repressed or excised, sites of discursive transgression and\npunishment are places where otherwise implicit limits are revealed.\n77 asserts nothing less than that \u201cthe progress of thought\u201d is dependent upon the \u201cdialectic of the\nrational and the reasonable\u201d (215, emphasis added). When the rational and the reasonable are\n\u201cmutually supportive,\u201d he intimates, there is no discernable political problem, but when \u201cfidelity\nto the spirit of a system leads to an unacceptable conclusion, in a word, to an unreasonable\nconclusion,\u201d this requires a reconsideration of the system itself (217). The particular and time-\nbound decision necessarily modifies the presumed universal, and a failure to attend properly to\nthe particular leads to unreasonable decisions. Progress, therefore, depends, as Derrida suggests,\non a meta-reflective appreciation for the complications provided by ever-changing circumstances\nand a willingness not to cling to increasingly anachronistic structuring fictions.\nIn the discussion period after Perelman\u2019s lecture, Habermas, in response, claimed that\nPerelman was really, like others before him, talking about the \u201cmeta-rational capacity\u201d to\nrecognize the limits of the rational, or the universal theoretical ideal, when applied to the\nreasonable, or the particular practical decision (217). And indeed this \u201cmeta-rationality\u201d is, as I\nam working to show, one of the central issues preoccupying all of the theorists we have\nreviewed, each of whom were also attempting, in their own unique ways, to work out the\nuniversal dimensions of human reason and their import for political argument.\nTo concretize the fruits of such theorizing on \u201cmeta-rationality\u201d or meta-reason and its\nrelationship to political change, and more specifically the dialectic between presumed political\nuniversals and their necessary transformation over time, consider Neta Crawford\u2019s (2002)\nanalysis of the global transformation over the last several hundred years from slavery to forced\nlabor, then from military to economic colonialism, and now, most recently, to nation building.\nCrawford, through an historical analysis that confirms Laclau\u2019s (2005) theory, which presumes\nthat political universals necessarily create antagonistic fields that eventually transform those\npresumed universals, shows how each shift, from structuring fiction to structuring fiction, has\nbeen accompanied by a clear and traceable process of normative argumentation surrounding\nrepressed discursive fields.\nAs Crawford\u2019s work shows, and in a manner resonant in ways with both Foucault\u2019s and\nHegel\u2019s historical philosophies, in different historical eras there are structuring, politically\nconsequential fictions that protect the interests of the dominant members of the political order\n(e.g., slavery is claimed to be a Christian duty to bring \u201cheathens\u201d out of their pagan darkness;\nforced labor teaches people \u201cthe Christian value of work\u201d and leads to their salvation;\ncolonialism is a way of helping \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d countries and their \u201cimmature\u201d peoples; neo-\nliberalism and \u201cfree\u201d trade is the best way to increase the wealth of third world countries; and it\nis the role of \u201cthe West\u201d to spread \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d around the world). Each\nstructuring fiction, claimed as a universal political truism, is deployed by those in power to\njustify their physical and/or economic dominance until enough counter-evidence emerges to\nprompt public criticism from less invested individuals within what passes for respectable society.\nOtherwise, the voices of the excluded and marginalized rarely have any significant effect, as they\nare repressed in every sense of the term. The relatively powerful voices of those who once\nbelieved in the structuring fiction slowly come to doubt its veracity as counter-evidence\naccumulates, and as their doubts increase they become increasingly alienated from that fiction.\nThose who were once \u201cinside the fiction\u201d demand reform, and reform is promised by those who\nremain true believers or cynical manipulators, despite the mounting evidence against their self-\ngratifying fiction. Concrete reform, however, is not forthcoming, due, returning to Derrida and\nBenjamin, to the inertia of the violence of what passes for law, and due as well to Foucault and\nLacan\u2019s emphasis on the pleasures of repression. Then, in light of their intransigence, the\n78 dominant forces are required to promise reform in writing, though meaningful reform is still not\nforthcoming, given the lingering power and metaphysical comfort the fiction still provides.\nUltimately, however, in light of the spoken and written promises, all broken, enough public\nshame is eventually heaped on the dominant groups supporting the fiction that they are\ncompelled to change their policies and institutions, which in turn leads to new structuring\nfictions, and the process endlessly repeats itself, though perhaps with marginal progress.15\nIs this some kind of neo-Hegelian progress of Spirit? Is this Foucault\u2019s notion of moving\nfrom one system of domination to another? Can it be both? Arguably, economic oppression is\nnot the same as cutting off a slave\u2019s nose, say, for not bringing in the requisite amount of gold,\nwhich was a nasty habit of Christopher Columbus and his fellow explorers, or cutting off some\nother body parts, as often occurred with runaway slaves in the southern United States prior to the\nCivil War (Loewen, 1995, 60-62). This does not necessarily mean, however, that the \u201cSpirit\u201d of\nhumankind is inexorably progressing. If Todd McGowan (2013) is correct, since all attempts to\nconstruct the \u201cgood\u201d society or to rid society of that which presumably pollutes what would\notherwise be \u201cgood\u201d is doomed to fail, \u201ca psychoanalytic politics\u201d must insist, a la Foucault, \u201con\nidentification with the limit rather than attempting to move beyond or eliminate it\u201d (20). This is\nbecause, McGowan argues, as obviously others do, that all political reason is built on structuring\nfictions that seek to paste over a fully unrecoverable lack at the heart of all subjectivity. Perhaps\nthe best we can do, therefore, as argumentation theorists, is to find ways to analyze not only the\nstructure of arguments in support of various political positions, but to also find ways of analyzing\nthe otherwise unconscious limits and repressions such positions entail.\nFormally, rationally, we cannot fully overcome or eliminate repression and limits, since\nthey are in fact the engines of the political itself. We cannot, in other words, ever fully remove\nthe \u201cstain\u201d of productive repression, or the \u201cviolence\u201d of law. All one has to do is look at\npolitical history. We continue to witness, and shall for the foreseeable future, the continuing\nproblems associated with jingoistic nationalism, exacerbated by the continuing fragmentation of\nthe globe into more and more \u201csovereign\u201d nations, and the problematic and anti-democratic\nevolution of international economic governing structures such as the World Bank, the\nInternational Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization. There are also the horrific\nglobal problems that continue to erupt as a result of the clash of the two dominant quasi-fictions\nstructuring world disorder today: reactionary fundamentalist terrorism against capitalism and its\nattendant secularism (e.g., Barber, 1995; Debord, 1998; \u017di\u017eek, 2002).\nSo, on the one hand, over the last two hundred years, as market relations have advanced\nacross parts of the world, we have witnessed a proliferation of both productive and destructive\nalienations. Productive alienations have led to a greater awareness, at least among critical\nphilosophers and rhetoricians, of the constitutive nature of language; thus, we have gained,\nmostly to the good, a productive distance from language. The \u201cfool,\u201d from such a perspective, is\nthe one who truly believes that their given language and subject position is the True language and\nsubject position, whereas the \u201cwise\u201d recognize their language\u2019s relativity and constitutive\nlimitations. Concretely, we have witnessed the physical violence of slavery slowly replaced,\nunder expanding capitalist conditions, by economic violence, which arguably could be\ncharacterized as actual progress. On the other hand, capitalism itself, as the rational dimensions\nof the reasonable would suggest, is necessarily triggering its own antagonisms, and who is to say\nwhere the dialectic between the \u201crationalism\u201d of fundamentalisms and political ideologies and\n15 The process is not dissimilar to the one described by Thomas Kuhn (1996) in his analysis of the structural\ntransformations involved in scientific revolutions.\n79 the \u201creason\u201d of secular capitalism, whose unwitting theoretical champions, as we have seen,\nfocus on rhetorical unconsciousness to undermine the violence of over-identification, will lead?\nIn sum, when placing these various perspectives on political history and argumentation in\ndialogue, we have discovered several formal, universal, hence rational, dimensions of the\nhistorically contingent and particular dimensions of the reasonable. We have seen that\nphilosophers from Schiller to Husserl were concerned about what they believed was the negative\ninfluence of technical rationality, or \u201csynchronic\u201d forms of field-specific rationality that\naccompany the ever increasing division of labor in capitalist society, on political reason. While\nargumentation theorists have long recognized the crucial importance of stepping back from one\u2019s\n\u201cnatural\u201d position in order to grasp a meta-perspective on a given rhetorical situation, the notion\nof synchronic discursive repression or elision is something relatively new.\nDerrida, Foucault, and Perelman, though in different ways, have pointed out other\nrational dimensions of the reasonable than the more specific unconscious limits synchronically\nimposed by technical rationalities. They have shown how all identities, and all structuring\nfictions that devolve from those identities, impose broadly unrecognized diachronic limits that do\na certain \u201cproductive violence.\u201d Derrida, drawing upon Benjamin\u2019s work on the inevitable\nviolence of law, argues for a meta-reflective stance on just such violence, just as Foucault argues\nfor a meta-reflective stance on the limits imposed by identities in order for us to recognize and\ncritique them. And Perelman, as Habermas noted, also sought to identify the universal principles\nat work within reason, particularly how the rational/universal/idea is in constant dialectical\ntension with the reasonable/particular/material.\nOver at least the last two centuries, from Kant forward, philosophers and argumentation\ntheorists have been concerned not only with the distinction between what they variously refer to\nas reason and rationality, they have been even more concerned with calling for greater meta-\nreflection on the power of language to construct humanly experienced reality. The arguments\npresented here suggest that all presumed political certainties are doomed not only by the\nunrecognized differences that haunt them all the time structurally, but as well by the future\nparticulars that will inevitably modify them. Yet forms of rhetorical unconsciousness, in the form\nof unquestioned limits imposed by technical rationalities and essentialist assumptions, certainly\nexist. In fact, they are required for what passes for subjective normality and political stability.\nThese unquestioning stances and their attendant repressed discursive fields, are the primary\nsources of political violence. For the vast majority of individuals, however, and for most of\nrecorded history, humans have taken their language for granted, assuming that their culturally\nsituated \u201ctruths\u201d are in fact Truths. Sometimes these \u201cTruths\u201d are disciplinary, taking the form of\nvarious professions and their attendant forms of technical rationality; sometimes these \u201cTruths\u201d\nare the broader ideological fictions that structure society.\nAt the very least, we know that presumed certainties in the realm of the political are\ndoomed to fail; that all law does a certain violence, particularly when it is not self-reflexive in\napplying the law to ever-changing circumstances; that when identities and structuring fictions are\n\u201cworking\u201d their limits often become invisible to those who inhabit and benefit from those\nidentities and fictions, creating zones of unconsciousness as repressed discursive fields; and that\nthe tensions between presumed universals and concrete particulars will never cease. Such meta-\nreason, or such insights into the nature of the political and its transformation, provide\nargumentation theorists today with conceptual tools for more precisely dealing with the\nblindnesses of presumed political certainties, enabling us to map not only the surface of\n80 arguments but their constituent silences, which in turn will enable us to consider more productive\nways of defending systems of politics and law that do less violence.\nTo put the challenge to argumentation theorists otherwise, while we continue to work to\ngain distance of language, so that the violence of true belief and essentialism can be attenuated, it\nappears that the metaphysical comforts and benefits provided by presumed certainties\noverwhelms, for the vast majority, the ability to meta-reflect on language and its necessary\nviolence. Furthermore, as has been observed, political action requires making concrete decisions\nin an ultimately undecideable terrain, so, no matter how much \u201cself-distance\u201d we gain, we still\nmust certainly act moment to moment based on what we believe. This means that, even if the\nclash of human differences ultimately leads to greater human freedom, a la Hegel, we cannot\never hope to fully escape from the unconscious dimensions of presumed universals and their\nviolence in the realm of the probable, the political, and the reasonable.\nIt is, then, a challenge for those who study argumentation and its political consequences\nto locate and utilize mechanisms for analyzing and critiquing arguments with these rational\ndimensions of the reasonable in mind, working to identify repressed discursive fields and their\nconsequences, and in so doing to take properly into account both the conscious and unconscious\ndimensions of persuasion.\nReferences\nAristotle (1987).

Thomas Goodnight\nUniversity of Southern California\ngtg@usc.edu\nAbstract: Modern studies of personal, technical and public argument feature dialogue,\nconversation, composition, performance and public address. Internet digital exchanges\noffer strings of arguments that position information from conventional contexts, but\nplatform and simulate exchange at a distance. Internet language games generate\nmemes. Memes fold into popular genres: the quarrel, quibble, and bickering. The\ngenerative qualities of language-games, mimesis and homology underwrite pervasive\ncontentious genres, even while communicative activism engages dissensus.\nKey Words: argument, cybersphere, dissensus, genre, homology, Internet, memes.\nWilliam Gibson author of Neuromancer (1984) coined the term \u201ccyberspace\u201d in a\npunk science fiction novel \u201cwhose hero, Case, \u2018jacks\u2019 his nervous system into a\n\u2018consensual illusion\u2019 where the world is a computer simulation and humans live apart\nfrom bodies\u201d (Edwards, 2000: 1). Science fiction was not far behind social fact. The first\nbrowser was Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s World Wide Web (WWW) developed at CERN in 1989.\nMark Andresson\u2019s Mosaic, the initial graphical Web browser, followed at the University\nof Illinois, Champaign-Urbana. Together, these achievements furnish a take-off point for\npopular electronic networks. The Internet explosion was so significant that the\nAmerican Council on Learned Society reports that by 2006 \u201cthe networks had become\ncompletely public in nature, and they are now thoroughly naturalized by the public\u201d\n(2008). \u201cThe Internet, the World Wide Web, and their successors are evolving rapidly\ninto a global digital network, a \u2018cybersphere,\u2019 interrelating people and their activities\nthrough robust, albeit ubiquitous, computers, networks, and intelligent hardware and\nsoftware,\u201d Daniel Atkins et al (2002) conclude. PEW (2015) reports that despite some\ngaps \u201cthe internet has become an integral part of everyday life across diverse parts of\nsociety.\u201d\nGiambattito Vico (1771/1996) believed that the rhetoric of a particular time was\nwoven into the arguments available to advocates within a culture. The rhetorical and\nphilosophical projects of argument studies, together, appear influenced by efforts to\nadvance critical thinking and to marshal an informed response to the modern practices\nof print and mass media. State propaganda and consumer advertising furnish the\ndiscourses and visual images that necessitate \u201cself-defense\u201d. The skills in informal logic\npreserve independent judgment. Conversations are analyzed as useful places for\nreaching a sound agreement. Critical discourse studies expose the semiotic practices\ncoding power into social relationships. Rhetorical argument features the appreciation of\nspoken words or written texts. The performances of public culture address local fans.\nQuestions of justice in the public sphere extend to a universal audience. The field of\nmodern argumentation inquiry encompasses the broad range of social, institutional and\npublic communicative reasoning constituting the modern cosmopolis (Toulmin ,1990).\n83 The Internet is a technology that draws from traditional spheres of argument practices\nin ways that unsettle socio-cultural, moral, and experiential contexts. The homological\nsimulation of good reasons induces vast populations to network, but good reasons\ndisplaced from their work in contexts evolve within distinctive styles and genre.\nSpheres theory organizes the activities and products of conversation, critical\nthinking, informal logic, conversation, discourse, controversy, and public address.\nSpheres theories posit that personal interaction, professional exchange, and public\ntransactions and performances exhibit argument qualities in common, but the\ncommunication activities of reason-giving and questioning also exhibit differences.\nControversy persists at the boundaries of spheres. Rules, norms, and conditions for\nreasonableness sometimes get caught up when discussing, disputing, or evaluating\nclaims in questions. That which is permissible, typical, or required to establish an\nasserted statement meaningfully becomes taken up in the dispute.\nIn Wayne Brockriede\u2019s view, argument broadly considered is a perspective taken\nby an interlocutor (Trapp & Schuetz, 2006). The Internet puts interlocutors in\ncomplicated, changing relationships with electronic signals and coded options, with\nvariable processing shaping simulated encounters. Normative accountability decreases\nas exchange is freed from context, then guided by filters designed to meet user\nsatisfactions and sponsor needs. From an Internet standpoint, a sphere is re-constituted\nby transforming practice into information that connects agents, agencies, activities and\noperations. Speakers and audience become networked as nodes and ties. The\ncybersphere translates, then aggregates, each argument homologically into the\nassociated signs of stimulated, natural behaviors. Any given homology is a rhetorical\ntrope, though often these are deployed literally as a representation of the natural world.\nSpheres are translated daily into millions of connections and disconnections,\nthereby putting the socio-cultural texts, performance of practice, and argument\ncommunities into modes of circulation. Coding, platforms, and processing are matters of\nprivate ownership; access to user reasoning and debate, generally, is considered fair\ngame by media industries and the state. A modern sphere becomes manifest when its\nboundaries are asserted, contested or modified; but often activities and events intersect\nin more or less informal, material arrangements driven by consensus and dissent.\nSpheres electrified onto the Internet become data formations that vacuum up, organize,\nand/or extend adjacent socio-cultural argument communities. The rules of non-\ndigitalized exchange, norms of reasoning, and styles of argument now become\nreplicated, varied, and merged in the vast simulations of exchange.\nThe modern spheres theory draws from and explicates field-grounded practices\nas well as media gambits of mass influence during the post-World War II era. The Cold\nWar featured state propaganda and mass advertising; but, it also featured a turn to\nvalue practical reason from international, cosmopolitan, and interdisciplinary\nperspectives. Does the cybersphere invite a totally new way of thinking about modern\nargumentation projects? If so, how does argumentation inquiry invent models that\nanticipate and critique the post-modern, global contexts of Internet exchanges?\nAt each stage of the digital revolution, scholars have raced to map and claim the\nnew territory. This chapter reads early theories that defined the Internet as a\nsupplement to modern communications, with utopian or dystopian possibilities. I then\nexamine the Internet with its postmodern differences, mimetic structures, and\n84 emergent genre. I claim that our modern projects of argumentation need to take into\naccount the odd postmodern communicative arrangements of digital, network society.\nSpecifically, I contend that modern argumentation theory brings into view\ndialogue, conversation, or news essays (editorials) as paradigms of practical reason and\ncontests of practice. Internet exchange is different. The World Wide Web (WWW) is\ntypified by novel strings of contention as well as renewal of older, less careful, loosely\nanchored argument genre: the quarrel, quibble, and bickering. The proliferation of\ngenre on the Internet constitutes a time similar to the early Renaissance. This essay\nexposes the rapid flow of genre of Internet practices moving across portals, online\ncommunities, games, blogs and social media. The generative qualities of language-\ngames, mimesis and homology re-popularizes early modern contentious genres,\npresently, even while the outcomes of vast networks of creative clash hold open the\nhope that more sophisticated genres of dissensus are emerging.\n1. Utopia or Dystopia? The Internet as Supplement\nIn times of revolutions, paradigms do shift, but it takes a while for grounded\ntheories to develop and the scope of change to be articulated. Change in communication\nstructures, practices, and possibilities are multiplying rapidly on the Internet. The\ncybersphere invites and connects multitudes of traditional genres of argument so\nrapidly that the distinctions between networked simulations and real world activities\ncontinue to diminish. The Internet is \u201cbeing incorporated into more routine aspects of\ndaily social life, as virtual and physical activities become increasingly integrated\u201d (Juris\n2005: 191). On a typical day at the end of 2015, the Internet attracts some 215 million\nAmerican adult users. Millions \u201clogged into the Internet to use email, get news, access\ngovernment information, check out health and medical information, participate in\nauctions, book travel reservations, research their genealogy, gamble, seek out romantic\npartners and engage in countless other activities (Rainie and Horrigan, 2005).\u201d By\nNovember 2016, there will be over 3 billion Internet users throughout the world\n(World Internet Users, 2015). The 21st century is witnessing a global communications\nrevolution.\n1.1 Utopic Possibilities\nA gaggle of theorists, across its quarter-century development, wick up\nexplanations of the Internet phenomena. Views are mixed. Some devotees claim the\nnew technology comprises a powerful supplement and improves traditional civil\nsociety, state, and public practices. For example, Brian D. Loader (1997) reports that:\n\u201cNetwork technologies are also increasingly used in public and political debates and\ncommunications\u201d (155). In the United States, and around the globe, the WEB is utilized\nby national and local government IT projects to \u2018improve efficiency\u2019 through extending\ntried and true means controlled by vetted, public institutions. Thus, the Internet is said\nto extend democratic spaces by organizing e-government and related projects such as\nthe Democracy Network (democracynet.org), Project Vote Smart (vote-smart.org), and\nthe California Online Voter (calvoter.org). As a supplement, the Internet becomes a\nmeans where a state can provide services more efficiently to clients, and citizens can\nparticipate in circulating opinion (Clift, 1999). These expectations have met with some\nsuccess. According to the Pew Internet & American Life Project (2005), \u201cthe Internet\n85 \u2018creates new online town squares\u2019 and \u2018enhances the relationship of citizens to their\ngovernment\u2019.\u201d\nThe Internet offers a strong supplement; it is a harbinger of fundamental\nchanges. Mass media democracy, for instance, offered citizens structures of gate-\nkeeping, one-way communication, and expert-informed campaigns of advertising and\npersuasion. To the contrary, online communication features \u201cdecentralized social\nnetworks and user-produced content\u201d that \u201care bypassing traditionally powerful\ncommunication gatekeepers\u201d (Dutton & Peltu, 2007: 78).\nThe framing devices constituting traditional mass media news genre, for\nexample, are now met with critical intervention. Network framing, cable narratives,\nnewspaper opinions now invite contestation. Twitter feeds steel the headline buzz.\nSeeing the transition optimistically, one might say: \u201cThe advent of the Internet marks a\nshift from traditional mass media environments\u201d to \u201cmulti media\u201d, hybrid spaces.\nWhereas mass media worked through channels, programs, and agendas, the Internet\n\u201cdoes not direct individuals into a clear path,\u201d rather it solicits \u201cconstruction and\ncreation\u201d and is \u201copen to continuous reconstruction, re-symbolization and\nredetermination by its users, giving them the opportunity to appear and disappear in\nmultitudes of different spaces, times, social roles and even bodies\u201d (Ester & Vinken,\n2003: 670). The result is that the cybersphere is the site of \u201cnew citizen media\u201d with\n\u201cbold experiments\u201d in creating public space (Youngs, 2007: 27).\n1.2 Dystopic Possibilities\nNot all thinkers are optimistic. Some prophesy dystopia. Totalizing critique\nasserts that the cybersphere not only perpetuates power inequalities but that it also\nenhances barriers to informed democratic participation. Subject to hegemonic\ncomplicity, the cybersphere\u2014like all media networks\u2014is the product of oligopolistic\ninterests that perpetuate and benefit from asymmetries of information, participation,\nand influence. From the outset, critics have fretted that a digital divide will \u201ccreate new\ncleavages, between those who and do and those who do not have access to and\ncommand of\u201d new communication resources (Brants, 2005: 143; Dutton & Peltu, 2007:\n18). Cass Sunstein, for example, argues that in \u201ccyberspace, people mostly choose\nalternatives that sharply limit their own horizons, and narrow the field of interests and\nconcerns\u201d (cited in Pajnik, 2005: 355). The result is that mass media campaign\nstrategies\u2014enacted for Internet environments\u2014\u201care increasingly geared toward\nfragmenting the public sphere, either by sending particular message to particular\npeople or by designing tools for citizens to encode their personal interests and\nsequester their consumption of news\u201d (Howard, 2005: 169).\nNiche participation creates conditions of fragmentation where \u201conline\ndeliberation appears to take place among like-minded people, which results in a\nfragmentation of cyber-discourse into mutually exclusive cyber-communities\u201d\n(Dahlberg, 2001a cited by Polat, 2005: 449). Self-re-enforcement of biases is\nnaturalized by \u201cfollowing\u201d posts or tweets from \u201cfriends\u201d ranging from intimates to\ncelebrity authorities. Indeed, the Trump presidential campaign appears to avoid\ntraditional advertising in favor of deploying Tweets, a postmodern distribution of\nsententiae. As genuine public debate and deliberation retreat, politicians resort to\ntalking points declamations or roiling in the unseemly.\n86 The fragmentation of the public sphere is perpetuated by the appropriation and\ndevelopment of network nodes and connections that constitute the platforms, servers\nand storage facilities owned by industry and surveilled by government, it is claimed.\nMass media networks and cable giants seek to convert the Internet into sybaritic\npleasures of consumption. Polat (2005) reports that \u201cthe Internet is already colonized\nby commercial interests largely because of potential for advertising revenue\u201d (450). The\nresult is a reduplication of the ubiquitous consumer appeals saturating the endless\nsmall-talking of networks.\n\u201cMuch of the discourse\u201d on the Internet, Dahlberg (2001a) claims, \u201csimply\nconsists of titillation, gossip and slander, superficial banter and other kinds of lowest\ncommon-denominator exchange.\u201d Admitting to some \u201ccritical discussion of\ncontroversial issues,\u201d he none the less concludes that \u201cmany participants simply seek\nout groups of like-minded others where member\u2019s interests, values and prejudices are\nreinforced rather than challenged\u201d (618). The result Papacharissi (2002) claims is that\n\u201cthis public space facilitates, but does not ensure, the rejuvenation of a culturally\ndrained public sphere\u201d (22). Political argument under such conditions may become\ncommon, vulgar, coarse in the demagogic call to vox populi.\nThe rational public debate expected of a public sphere does not result because\nthe Internet is not equally open, not free from institutional predispositions, occupied by\ndiversions that suit the time-wasting activities of consumer interests. In point of fact,\nthe Internet has become a huge dumping ground for banal messages promoting\nconsumerism. According to Judy Foster (1999), \u201cBusinesses are increasingly flocking to\nthe Internet for a variety of marketing purposes, including research, publicity, sales, and\nadvertising\u201d (81). Whatever the limits of mass-media in providing a forum for public\ndiscussion and debate, the composition, granularity, speed of distribution and global\nscope of the cybersphere alerts us to a whole new sphere of communications that\ninvites critical study of argument practices.\nWhether optimistic about extending the efficiency of current institutional\narrangements or pessimistic about these outcomes, the two alternative views of the\npublic do share a common premise. All activities of the new array of communication\ntechnology are regarded as constituting mere convergences with, or supplements to,\ntraditional media and practices. Neither view is complete, however.\n2. Dissensus: Virtual Argument\nDebates over the essential nature of the Internet as a supplement to modern\npractices continues. In my judgment, such descriptions do not attend to the unique,\nemergent differences of the network, information structuring of modern personal,\nprofessional, public and media practice. Thus, we turn to regard the cybersphere, not as\nan ontological way of being in the world, but as a hybridized or blended pragmatic space\nwhere both (1) the trained habits of consumption from the mass media age become recast,\nappropriated and exploited as well as (2) new challenges of production, audience\nacquisition, and critique become available. The cybersphere produces dissensus. Its\nvirtual exchanges of difference put arguments into processes of re-purposing, de-\ncontextualization, distribution, circulation, and assembly. The feedback loops of\nexchange take on a non-linear dynamic. The Internet develops as network controversy.\n87 The mobile lives of rising generations throughout the globe generate unpredictable and\nuncertain feedback loops that recast and vary modern genres of communication.\n2.1 Cybersphere and Dissensus\nThe cybersphere now supports global networks of knowledge, exchange and\nassociation of people now caught up in the wider contexts of planetary living. Dissensus\nis its main product, with emergent objections, disagreement, deferrals and dissent\nblossoming. These are antagonisms and agonistic relationships that are rendered\nemergent by message spread with uncontained and unpredictable overlaps and chance\nencounters of accidental or unintended audiences. The cosmologies of people\ninhabiting diverse continents are becoming connected through exchange on a massive\nscale for the first time in human history. Modern institutions that depend on secrecy are\nsubject to leaks. Audiences escape, subvert or turn back on merchandizing campaigns.\nAt the same time as the diverse cultures of the globe become resources for digital data\nminers, the tests for the facticity, relevance, and genuineness of resulting\ncommunications become predictably more extensive, even with greater uncertainty to\noutcomes.\nThe convergent qualities of Internet communication offer a unique context for\ncommunicative exchange. Platforms code, simulate and store information that translate\nand assimilate signs and sign systems translating space, time, causality, and\nengagement into file arrangements, access, and storage. Networks of exchange spread.\nModern argument studies are grounded personally in face-to-face interaction,\nprofessionally in transactions, and publically in address (Goodnight, 2012). The\ncybersphere is not a place where the truth of a communication\u2014or the assurances of\naccountability requisite to correcting false and misleading arguments in face-to face-\ninteractions\u2014can be understood through contextual constraints, cues, or actions.\nDissensus is the outcome.\n2.2 Virtual Difference and Distance\nThe cybersphere offers spaces for anonymous, networks of connections that\nmimic legitimate institutions while pursuing ends ulterior to and neither anticipated\nnor approved by clients (inscribed as \u2018users\u2019). The absence of privacy and strategies of\ncontrol are discussed frequently, on the Internet and off. The new collective conditions\nof communication are brought to attention by journalists as well as scholars. Steven Ray\nVedro (2000) concludes with a modest plea for civil regard when provoked by\ndifference, \u201cOur only defense in an interconnected cybersphere\u2014where old notions of\nprivacy are falling all around us\u2014is to practice both courageous honesty and deep\ncompassion for the lies we all tell each other\u201d (1).\nUnlike framed mass media products, the cybersphere does publicize exchange\nand encourages \u2018dividual critical response. The \u201csharing economy\u201d depends upon\narguments by users who testify to product or experience quality. As a result, mass\nmedia advertising becomes ever more aggressive, to demand notice. Public address,\ntoo, is aggressively packaged by mass media through framing of situations, polling, and\nmessage campaigns. Tests of informal logic hold advocates\u2014whether acting individuals\nor encapsulated in messages through mass media narratives\u2014accountable to standards\nof cogency, coherence, and consistency. Routinely claims on the Internet are not\n88 grounded by the fields of practice within which arguers have standing, by disciplined\ndiscourse structures, or by accountable forums with a legally empowered and\nhistorically situated audience. Media literacy is a value of modern education, but\nreading network messages require new, additional or different ways of thinking\ncritically.\n2.3 Assembly and Circulation\nInternet communication is defined, monitored, and constrained by servers and\nplatforms that make available participation and adapted by surveilling and adjusting to\nuse patterns. Contexts are fluid. Like the pamphleteers of the Gutenberg era, advocates\nflock to the Internet because the costs of dissemination are low, the means of\nproduction simple, and the potential audience vast. Forming issue-based groups, the\nadvocates are \u201cnot geographically bound\u201d (Polat, 2005: 448); their \u201cvirtual\ncommunications\u201d cross \u201call kinds of boundaries, national as well as international, as\nwell as being contained by them\u201d (Youngs, 2007: 24).\nThe speed with which groups can assemble and form redefines the crowd;\npassions gather among people interested in convergent ways of doing things, getting\ntogether, gathering information, and making interventions. \u201cThe online polity can\nmobilize mass support quickly\u2026through email and mobile phone contacts to organize\nonline lobbying or to form \u2018flash mobs\u2019 who assemble at short notice\u201d (Dutton & Peltu,\n2007: 7). The broadness and speed with which claims, and counter claims, can travel is\nunprecedented. Local and global controversies swirl and mix on a vast scale. As Paul\nStarrs (1997) puts it: \u201cBoundaries of sovereignty once traditional and stolid, casting\nstates in the shapes decreed by great colonial powers years ago, are ever more\nchallenged: shot through like a colander by an information-moving system of\nunmitigated, unparalleled efficiency and redoubtable power\u201d (1).\nThe results of the unique breadth and fluidity of Internet exchanges are\nassembled into a mix of traditional media framing strategies for notoriety, on the one\nhand. On the other, arguments advance critical observations targeted to dismantle\nframes, integrate on-going opinion, substitute expressive acts for analysis, and pursue\nnovel forms of stretching or diverting attention. The result is the transformation of\nargument into the wider, ambiguous, and multi-valent assertions of public culture.\nRohlinger (2007) reports that: \u201cPolitical media outlets, which include independently\nowned newspapers and magazines, websites, art, poetry, storytelling, and film, are\nimportant to deliberative process because they provide particularistic groups a \u2018free\nspace\u2019 for form and articulate their own values, interests, and visions of a common good\naway from more dominant or opposing groups\u201d (123).\n2.4 Non-linear Dynamics\nMass media persuasion campaigns depend upon strategic message creation,\nrepetition, branding, and purchasing of print space and air time for effect. The Web is a\nsite where arguments flow in lateral, nonlinear ways. According to Bennett, \u201cwhat is\nchanging in politics is not a decline in citizen engagement, but a shift away from old\nforms that is complemented by the emergence of new forms of political interest and\nengagement\u201d (Bennett, 1998: 744). Writing of the Internet, Sinekopova (2006)\nconcludes: \u201cIn a linear description, a small change in the dynamic of a phenomenon\n89 produces a proportionate (predictable) outcome; in a nonlinear description, a small\nchange can produce a big (unpredictably disproportionate) change\u201d (514). In short, as\nthe technologies become more accessible, the division between producer and receiver\nevaporates. As a result, \u201cinteractivity opens up unprecedented opportunities for more\ninclusive public engagement in the deliberation of policy\u201d Coleman (2005: 13).\nEngagement is often defined by the work of programmers who platform exchange,\nhowever. Through blogs, virtual communities, social media and networked Web sites,\ncitizens participate, criticize, and produce argument, albeit in restricted ways and under\nsurveillance. Nevertheless, netizens give up the role of passive spectators.\n2.5 Popularizing Disputation\nReputations can rise or fall as obscurity and fame trade places. Traditional\nparties and social movements are aware of the power of critical public communication.\nGroups engage in \u201cpolitical \u2018hacktivism\u2019, by massively sending emails to political\nleaders, by using information technology for community building, by designing and\nmaintaining political websites, by participating in political chat groups,\u201d by using\nwebsites and zines and political demonstrations (Ester & Vinkin, 2003: 663).\nIncreasingly, digital technologies \u201care used to organize political information in the\npublic sphere\u201d but unlike those used in traditional media, \u201cthese interactive tools allow\nfor both the production and consumption of political content\u201d (Howard, 2005: 154).\nClearly, novel forms of engagement supplement traditional ends of political\norganizing through public argument. Yet, control, repetition, analytic development, and\ndissemination are not the grounds upon which success can be built for these\nparticipatory media. The question of production calls attention to invention, ingenuity,\nand novelty. Ingenious ways are crafted to unbundle standing narratives, niche a\ncommunity of interlocutors, and burnish causes with telling self-representation. Youngs\n(2007) imparts a clue to appreciating this unique form of public argument when he tells\nus that \u201cthe politics of virtual space is as much about what it means to \u2018be\u2019 and \u2018do\u2019\nonline as it is about the vast amount of information the Internet makes accessible\u201d (24).\nDe Vreese (2007) extends the insight in observing that \u201cthe young online consumer is\nalso politically active,\u201d noting that \u201ccivic mindedness, digital political participation,\nconsumption, and online social networking go hand in hand\u201d (214). Instead of forming\nclosed parties, lodges or communities, the Google Generation revels in multiplicity,\nconstruction, and shifts among weak ties that \u201cconnect citizens to numerous others\u201d\nand invite people\u2019s lives to \u201cbecome more dispersed across networks of interest,\npreference, and passion\u201d whose interconnections await a capture claim of attention,\nframed as engaging controversy (Coleman, 2005: 208).\n2.6 Conduits for Controversy\nIn Internet exchange, the groundings of personal, technical and public argument\nare not discrete but interwoven and continuous. The spectacle of mass media\npresentations continues, independently as well as more closely integrated with online\nmobile services and applications. Media frames that discipline stories and events are\ncritiqued and multiplied by the play of creative remix and production of images and\nsymbols. Indeed, the circuits of consumer culture on the Internet become vehicles for\npublic debate. As the Coleman Foundation discovered, a popular charity that supported\n90 research in breast cancer could become engulfed in controversy for yielding to\nconservative pressures for lack of support on Planned Parenthood. The choice of\nconsumption become sites for self-representation of advocates criticizing or defending\nthe products or services of state, society, media or institutions bound together across\nmultiple networks of communication, awaiting the triggering moments of unexpected\ncontroversy and debate.\nIn the modern frame of argumentation, critical thinking appears to have as its\nend a reasonable justification for a justified support of a proposition. A good\nproposition, well argued, produces an informed agreement. Such agreements work\ntoward consensus. The Internet appears to sponsor through its qualities of distance,\nassembly, circulation, non-linear forms, and controversies a communicative activism\nthat fosters display of difference. Dissensus is an equivocal goal. Just as the Internet\nreduces the entry costs of groups wishing to develop a genuine voice, so it provides\naccess to manufactured controversies where special interests use fraudulent means to\ndelay reasonably supported actions and snare publics into self-injuring schemes that\njustify ignorance (Ceccarelli, 2011). The Internet raises the stakes of argument.\n3. Contagion and the Crowd\nThe post-modern condition of the cybersphere renders connection between\nservers, platforms, and private companies an argument generating machine. Network\nsociety\u2019s exchange operations feature neither the uninterrupted extension of traditional\nnorms, practices and means of the critical-rational or mass mediated public sphere\n(Dahlberg, 2001b), nor the unqualified opportunity for rhizomic wondering. In fact, the\napparent rootless, topic-surfing, Nomad user contributes to the self-feeding engines of\nsurveillance, storage, and circulation. Nomads or \u2018dividuals are entrapped in\nintrasubjective exchange reinforced by feedback filters that loop information into\ninterest satisfying schema. An arms race results between corporate efforts to weave\npopulations into the life-worlds of control societies and self-fashioned communicative\nactivist efforts to hack, reroute, and turn the system\u2014going into \u201cdark space\u201d or off the\ngrid entirely. Thus, the cybersphere exists as a scene of \u201cstruggle\u201d (Hauben & Hauben,\n1997) between entrepreneurs who develop grounded strategies that secure and\nestablish best or popular practices and publics and those communities who resist the\npurposes of automated production and extraction of their communicative labor.\nCommunication has been a 21st century modern discipline that, oddly, now is being\ntransformed, through media studies, into a resource to serve neo-liberal economic\ninterests.\nThe sources of explanation of cybersphere activities are pulled by corporations\nfrom modern disciplines such as information sciences, economics, geography, and\npsychology. Socio-psychology and social biology provide resources for theorizing\neffects and building platforms. For example, Internet tendencies to generate memes are\nsometimes associated with the long-standing research traditions of contagion and\ncrowd behavior. Power laws operate on the Internet such that the limited time and\nattention of individual users are blotted up by a changing, small distribution of\nproducers (Kottke, 2015). Brief visits to well-connected sites constitute rule rather than\nexception. The result of a proliferation of sources for distribution ironically weakens\n91 the variety of robust, genuine coverage of events. More commentary (about how people\nfeel), less news (about actions in context). I take up \u2018contagion\u2019, and show how its\nunderstandings are coupled with \u201cmemes\u201d, a popular term for language games\n(visual/word hybrids, in this case) that are noticed, draw comment, and spread widely.\nThe bio-social theory of mimetics is a useful way to understand through an example\nhow theory and practice evolve. I counter this view by pulling memes back into the\nlonger and richer rhetorical tradition that features on contested mimesis actions.\n3.1 Contagion Theory\nContagion theory has its modern origins in Gustave LeBon's (1895) idea that\ncrowd behavior was like a \u201ccontagion,\u201d but not easy to explain as in crowds people\nseemed to follow a \u201chypnotic\u201d pattern. James Baldwin (1897) found contagion to be a\nsocial suggestion: \u201cAn emotion may sweep through a gathering of people with a\nstrength altogether out of proportion to the occasion of it in the individual\u2019s ordinary\nthought or life\u201d (254). Wilfred Trotter (1908) found imitation to be a powerful social\ninducement to group action and a legacy of the \u201cherd instinct\u201d; while I. W. Howerth\n(1916; 1919) deployed the \u201cherd instinct\u201d to explain collective susceptibility for\nparticipating in the slaughter of the First World War. William McDougall (1920)\nthought of contagion as the product of a \u201cgroup mind\u201d that was swept up in a \u201ccontagion\nof emotion\u201d such as a panic. Contagion replaces orders or direct requests by virtue of a\nmissing, suggestive part of the discourse, a replicating piece that induces an individual\nto see a notion as one\u2019s own idea\u2014even while the idea itself is being spread like\nwildfire through a social network. The contagion metaphor transforms inducements to\nco-operate instinctively or at least without considered, analytic, reflective thought from\nthe biological world at levels from human, to animal, to microbiological. Although the\ntheories of causality vary, theorists across the twentieth century have attempted to\nexplain a phenomena of social behavior where actions and opinion spread through\nimitation for non-rational reasons\u2014even while the induced individual and collective\nbehaviors result in good or bad outcomes, leading to extinction or survival.\nMost recently, David Levy and Paul Nail strove to account for these\n\u201cheterogeneous\u201d groups of phenomena that they believe basically have a social basis.\nThese scholars define social contagion \u201cas the spread of affect, attitude, or behavior\nfrom Person A (the \u2018initiator\u2019) to Person B (the \u2018recipient\u2019), where the recipient does not\nperceive an intentional influence attempt on the part of the initiator\u201d (1993: 266). The\nresults of social contagion are dis-inhibitory exchanges. Actions become licensed that\nwould not otherwise be undertaken, when behavior is authorized by beliefs echoed\nfrom the perception of repetition of what appears to count as reasonable conduct for\nthis communication. Contagion mutates events and norms in a special combination that\nauthorizes beliefs, invites action, and varies with repetition. From the point of view of\nargument, thoughts function as authorizations for action by reconciling internal\nconflicts, authorize a style and range of repetition, enveloping moods that spiral\nthinking. Like rhetoric, social contagion is the art of influence where indirection colors\nthinking, invites action, and provokes self-spreading repetition and imitation. In the\ndigital world, this quality of interaction is known as viral communication.\n3.1 Going Viral\n92 The viral metaphor emphasizes the self-generating and self-assembling nature of\nmessage sending, acquisition, and resending. \u201cLike a software virus in a computer\nnetwork or a physical virus in a city,\u201d Aaron Lynch (1996) argues, \u201cthought contagions\nproliferate by effectively \u2018programming\u2019 for their own retransmission. Beliefs affect\nretransmission in so many ways that they set off a colorful, unplanned growth race\namong diverse \u2018epidemics\u2019 of ideas\u201d (2). The spread of a belief is limited by its own\nsuccess, however. \u201cProselytic thought contagion becomes self-limiting as host\npopulation becomes self-limiting as host population growth diminishes the supply of\nnonhosts\u201d (1996: 6), a meme thereby growing dormant or absorbed into the mundanity\nof everyday life, \u201csetting the stage for renewed outbreaks of old movements and initial\noutbreaks of new movements.\u201d\nThe equipment for self-replication\u2014interest or satisfaction\u2014carries along with\nit attack and defense mechanisms that position the meme not to be absorbed by\ncompeting strains and to undercut or attack competitors. The sin of idolatry, for\ninstance, insulates the iconography of a religion from false gods; the image of false gods\nundercuts religious belief, whether Jesus as your home boy on TV or Allah in a Danish\nnewsmagazine. According to Lynch, controversy is a key site for \u201ccontagions in conflict.\u201d\n\u201cSome of the liveliest thought contagions live outside the strict headings of family, sex,\nreligion, and health. These include memes on abortion, war, handguns, and other public\nissues. The tendency to ignite controversy unites these \u2018leftover\u2019 thought contagions.\nCompeting beliefs in these areas move their adherents deeply, sometimes to risk\neverything in spreading or stopping an idea\u201d (1996: 157).\n3.2 Memes\nArgumentation in the cybersphere may be cast as a contest among \u201cmemes,\u201d a\nterm \u201cderived the Greek word mimea, \u2018something imitated\u2019 [which] often refers to a\npiece of information passed from one mind to another (Meme, n.d.).\u201d Dictionary.com\nidentifies a meme as \u201ca unit of cultural information, such as a cultural practice or idea,\nthat is transmitted verbally or by repeated action form one mind to another\u201d (n.d.). The\nconceptual framework for memes is based on a homologous comparison from the\nbiological and information worlds. As a gene is to genetic reproduction, so a meme is to\nthe reproduction of information. Just as organisms are self-assembling biological\nentities that reproduce through genetic instructions\u2014with an occasional mutation, so a\nmeme is a self-assembling information entity that reproduces through imitation,\nrepetition, and variation. \u201cMemes supposedly have, as their fundamental property,\nevolution via natural selection in a way very similar to Charles Darwin\u2019s idea\nconcerning biological evolution, on the premise that replication, mutation, survival and\ncompetition influence them. For example, while one idea may become extinct, other will\nsurvive, spread and mutate\u2014for better or worse\u2014through modification\u201d (Meme, n.d.).\nThe term, idea, is used here loosely, for a meme assembles its audiences through a self-\nrepeating patterning artifact\u2014\u201cthoughts, ideas, theories, practices,\u201d as well as \u201chabits,\nsongs, dances and moods.\u201d Whereas genes are transmitted vertically from generation to\ngeneration to a species that become selected to thrive in a habitat, memes are\ntransferred laterally and form groups called \u201cmeme complexes\u201d forming a \u201cmemeplex\u201d\nsuch as that information taken in and disbursed by members of the Catholic church to\nthe faithful. Thus, \u201ca meme is nothing more than a pattern of information, one that\n93 happens to have evolved a form which induces people to repeat that pattern. Typical\nmemes include individual slogans, ideas, catch-phrases, melodies, icons, inventions, and\nfashions\u201d (Grant, n.d.).\nThe meme has qualities similar to propaganda insofar as it attends to how \u201can\nidea gets replicated\u201d in a useful way. \u201cMemetics is vital to the understanding of cults,\nideologies, and marketing campaigns of all kinds, and it can help to provide immunity\nfrom dangerous information-contagions. You should be aware, for instance, that you\nhave just been exposed to the Meta-meme, the meme about memes\u201d (Grant, n.d.). The\nsite par excellence for the study of memes is the Internet. Across different segments of\nthe cybersphere patterns travel at warp speed, whether accumulated by aggregators,\nreproduced by large media outlets, swirling among bloggers, or spread by private\ndistribution lists. The spreading meme may not resemble an argument in the traditional\nsense of a claim backed by evidence. Indeed, memes are part of a swirl of comment\nattracting symbols for an \u201ceconomy of attention\u201d (Lanham, 2006). \u201cAn internet\nphenomenon is akin to a fad, in which something relatively unknown becomes\nincreasingly popular, but usually for a short duration of time. It is nearly impossible to\naccurately measure the depth of a phenomenon\u2019s popularity, and different groups of the\nInternet may participate more than others. The Internet\u2019s lack of physical boundaries\nleads to a much faster and wider spread of information and ideas, especially when the\nsubject is based around humor or curiosity\u201d (Internet Phenomenon, n.d.). The Internet is\nalso the place where the spread of controversy accelerates, as memes spread, clash,\ndisappear.\n3.3 Mimesis\nThe term meme of course is well known in the ambit of rhetorical studies as\nmimesis, a concept at the heart of classical rhetoric, perhaps the original technology of\ncommunication. Rhetoric certainly is a way of patterning information in ways that are\nmemorable, repeatable, and mindfully engaging. Arguably, memes generate dramatic,\ncontestatory, competitive linguistic enactment of argument (Bailie, 1995). It is\nsometimes forgotten that the aim of rhetorical argument is to play the overt words\nspoken or written against the covert words attributed or understood by the listener or\nreader. Rhetorical tropes or figures are useful forms to engage the mind in cultural\nactivities; and the end of a good rhetorical encounter may not be simple persuasion but\nthe provision of a useful, exciting or robust vocabulary, ways of putting things, that can\nbe re-spoken as persuasion, like rumor, spreads but in self-organizing ways.\nAdditionally, the constitution of the rhetorical arts, the working stuff of the handbook\ntradition, were topics and tropes picked up from practice, sheered for content or form,\nand then put back together in the technologies of public performance in the courts,\nassemblies or classrooms. Mimesis is an illusive term, but according to Aristotle, human\nbeings enjoy imitating what they see or hear in others; mimetic art \u201cnot only functions\nto recreate existing objects or elements of nature, but also beautifies, improves upon,\nand universalizes them. Mimesis creates a fictional world of representation in which\nthere is no capacity for a non-mediated relationship to reality\u201d (Mimesis, n.d.). Rhetoric\nis a mimetic art par excellence, intervening in the natural process of thought with the\nartistic techniques of argumentative development. Just as the rhetorical tradition\nunderwent a change in its mimetic conventions when moving from oral to written\n94 discourse, and again from the work of the scribe to that of the printing press, so rhetoric\nis invited to make a similar move, critically investigating particular cases in order to\ndiscover the principles of self-assembling grammar of symbolic exchange and\ninteraction. Thus, to the criticism of WEB \u2018memes\u2019 as arguments.\nIf the meme world is to be accepted on its face, a number of taken-for-granted\nassumptions about argumentation need to be bracketed or set aside when reading,\ninterpreting and teaching argument. Initially, let\u2019s put on hold two key assumptions of\nlinear argument, and then construct a model of an elliptical argument that I think may\nbe appropriate to controversy-carrying memes that turn quarrels, quibbles, bickering,\nand loaded expressives (Like and Dislike) into widespread genre characteristic of the\ncybersphere. These arguments proceed in a pattern that put into play the tropes and\nfigures of language games, working out the values of a proposition, a statement that is\nplaced into contention. Shallow, short, swift, recursive, and varied are likely patterns of\nWEB spread and amplified arguments tying into networks of exchanges among nodes of\ninterest; these may cue larger argument structures\u2014patterns of legal reasoning,\nideological belief, field grounded knowledge\u2014but the WEB is parasitic upon knowledge\nbases, assimilating large volumes of information, its means of access \u2018key word\nsearches\u2019 are designed to maneuver through breadth, not invite depth. Thus, WEB\nargument spreads not because of the power of orderly, thorough, detailed development\nin a linear, cumulative form, but by the mico-maneuvers of mimetic repetition and\nvariation. The \u2018meme\u2019 may emerge from a localized situation and exchange but once\nreleased it is context free, a permanently overheard entity whose conventions are\ncarried with it as a self-assembling argument-game. The fresh-spontaneity may be fixed\nin patterns by robots that orbit discourses, draw from popular rankings, and\nmanufacture new associations and variations in the language game. The automated and\nsimulated attention-getting argumentation should not be mistaken for natural\nbehaviors.\n3.4 Homology and Controversy\nInformation systems patterning, however, can adapt behavioral patterns of\nflocks, swarms, schools, armies, troupes and herds to map, follow, and re-pattern\nexchange. The homological structure of self-reproduction varies in mimetics between\ngenetics with natural selection among \u2018ideas\u2019 argued to be a way of mapping \u2018cultural\nevolution,\u2019 and a discourse of host-parasite. Homology is the master trope of the\ncybersphere. Darwinist Richard Dawkins coined the word \u2018meme\u2019 in his 1976 bestseller\nThe Selfish Gene. The word\u2014which is ascribed to an idea, behavior or style that spreads\nfrom person to person within a culture has since been reappropriated by the internet\u201d\n(Solon, 2013). The appropriate use is a homology where an information organizing\nnatural structure is equated to information using simulations of communication. As\ncommunication events, memes \u201care information that varies and is selectively copied.\nWhile genes compete to get replicated when plants and animals reproduce, memes\ncompete to get stored in our memories (or books, tapes, and computers) and get passed\non to someone else.\u201d In contrast to Dawkins, Do-It-Yourself net theorists explain that a\nmeme is: \u201cA contagious information pattern that replicates by parasitically infecting\nhuman minds and altering their behavior, causing them to propagate the\npattern\u2026.Individual slogans, catch-phrases, melodies, icons, inventions, and fashions\n95 are typical memes\u201d(Glenn cited in Dvorak, Pirillo and Taylor, 2004: 387; Mimetic\nLexicon, n.d.).\nWhereas gene replication is genuine to what one becomes, viral memes thrive by\nsupplying information that imitates valid instructions, in the case of communication\nwinnowing their way into socially defined conventions that trigger reactions. Shopping,\nfashion, and politics connects memes to purchase. Not all networked offers are\nbargains, however. Fraud, theft, and piracy are an ever-present risk as is surveillance,\nunintended circulations, and institutional screening. User power relations are\nprecarious to fads, schemes, and hustles.\nTake Phishing, for instance, where an alarming message is sent by someone who\nclaims to be in genuine need\u2014that works toward your advantage. The offer is actually a\nbig fraudulent exchange where the mark sends money and reveals financial\ninformation. Users are marks; senders, cheats\u2019 WEB platforms, the shill. A large\npopulation of users serves as an enticing promise to simulations-on-the-short-con.\nHoaxes, frauds, and flim-flams are likely pay offs, even if only a tiny percentage bite.\nInternet habits resemble communication. Forget the difference is hazardous. Microsoft\nfinds that solicitors from Nigeria identify the country where requests are located,\nroutinely (Herley, n.d.). Security hacking and identity theft are widespread, but separate\nissues. The Internet is laced with rogue behaviors and outcomes.\nDawkins argues that religions pose similar power questions, Susan Blackmore\nobserves. The lure: \u201cThey use threats (hell and damnation), promises (heaven,\nsalvation, and God\u2019s love), and instructions to pass them on (teach your children, read\nthe texts, pray and sing in public),\u201d as well as using \u201ctricks\u201d to protect themselves from\nskepticism\u201d (Blackmore 2000). The mixed metaphor quality suggests that mimetics, far\nfrom a science of human cognition, is a homologically argued structure\u2014a naturalized\nfigure\u2014that purports to account for many of the phenomenon induced by trajectories\nwithin the WEB environment. The life of platforms is, arguably, like that of adaptive\norganisms. So, epidemiology and natural selection are imagined to join forces at the\nlevel of competition, both signified by successfully programmed reproduction,\nexpanding populations, and adaptive change or mutation. Clearly, the symbolic,\ncognitive dimensions of this phenomenon can be organically cast, but not indigenously\nexplained.\nThe spread of memes in controversy feature the self-replicating feature of those\nsorts of communication that spread quickly, over a wide-space. In Kantian terms, this is\nthe stuff of \u201cidle talk\u201d and consigned to the underside of the public sphere as gossip.\nSuch communications are arguments whose evidence diminishes in proportion to the\nnotoriety of the claim\u2014the very stuff of a tabloid dominant public sphere. In late\ncapitalism, Jerry Springer took the place of Walter Cronkite. Once the exception, now\nthe rule the news agitates only to calm with commercial sales of hygiene and big\npharmaceutical products. Unsourced bids to hype, push, declare products find pseudo-\nfueling the Internet a set of ongoing enterprises.\nNevertheless, whereas gossip follows a private social circuit of word of mouth,\nthe Internet takes the private to public so that not only are the claims of interest spread,\nbut the debate sparked is also aired. Just as the news is shadowed by the blogosphere,\nwriters who question the choice of frames, timing of the story, and fairness of coverage,\n96 so, too, communities engage in criticism across the broad scope of social structures,\nrepresentations of identity and relevant topics.\n4. Quarrels, Quibbles, & Bickering\nIn times of media change, new genres emerge and old ones play different roles.\nGenre theory attends to social action (Miller, 1984). Memes fold into genres. The\nInternet brings attention to the transformation of minor genres in one sphere to occupy\nmajor pragmatic, literary or rhetorical places in another (Gilrow, 2009). Old forms of\nargument, too, become refreshed. Genre studies attend to the forms and uses of\nargumentation through attention to distinctive patterns of use to establish and contest\nvalidity, soundness, objection, correction, combination and difference are assembled\ninto reasoning practices.\n4.1 New and Old Argument Genres\nThe simulations of personal, professional and public communication on the\nInternet create mixed spaces for argumentation. Some novel forms of argument do\nsupplement traditional means of communication and contestation (Schneider & Foot,\n2004). Internet genres change, rapidly\u2014driven by rewards for competitive success in\nattracting users and advertisers. Less than five years ago, blogs were novel. There was\nserious discussion whether citizen journalism\u2014which both added facts to the public\nsphere and critiqued media and government frames\u2014was serious. Soon after with\ncloud expansion there are, \u201cmillions of Web logs in which otherwise unknown citizens\noffer their perspectives on the world\u201d (Coleman, 2005: 208). The genre on-line\ncommunity was driven to extinction. The new figure of social media attracts capital,\nacademic attention, and big data work. The dark net exists as a shadow counterpart to\nthe post-modern waves of change.\nIn times of media change, new genres emerge. Old ones become refashioned.\nGenre theory attends to social action (Miller, 1984) that comes to characterize a way or\nmanner of communicating. Internet developments bring attention to the transformation\nof minor genres in one sphere to occupy major pragmatic, literary or rhetorical places\nin another (Gilrow, 2009). Genre studies attend to the forms and uses of argumentation\nthrough analysis of the distinctive patterns of use. Use finds motion in the assertion and\ncontestation of claims. Reflectively, the controversy moves up to drag into the mix the\nrules of the game: the sources for establishing validity, soundness, objection, correction,\ncombination and difference. Contestation over the structures, meaning, and acts of\nargument are inserted, absorbed and assembled into ever-advancing digital practices.\n4.2 Contentious Genre\nOld genres of argument take on new importance. The social media memes of\nplatformed exchange encourages chatter, gossip, and assertive expression. These\nsequence sententiae\u2014affective/normative gestures\u2014through touch buttons linked to\nlike and disliking, emoticons, and reply strings. Simulated speech acts fold into the\ngenres of quarrel, quibble and bickering. These genres achieved modern prominence\nand form with the advent of printing and pamphleteering in Europe. The forms descend\ncommonly from the feuding class-based conflicts of honor culture and pastoral society.\nAgonistic exchange now constitutes signature streams of virtual public migrant\n97 cultures. The ongoing back and forth appear to fulfill the expectations of contagion\ntheory. The self-organizing mimetic organization uncertainly exploits the self-feeding\nqualities of language games in play. Just as contagion has moved from a minor\ntheoretical explanation of influence to a more widespread role, so, too, the genres of\nquarrel, quibble, and bickering have ascended to occupy a prominent place among\ninternet publics. Just as contagion theories change in the digital context, so too quarrels,\nquibbles, bickers (all assertives) need to be appreciated as genre of argumentation as\ninteresting and instructive, in their own way, but different than in their tactical\nsimulations of problem solving, dialogue, conversation, advertising or logical reasoning.\nOnce conspiracy theorists were identified as marginal; these, too, have gone\nmainstream.\nOlder models of communicative argument and their dissemination of influence\nhave become resources for extrapolation and extension to information cloning,\nmodeling, simulation and reproduction, thereby extending coding into connections with\nand commodification of invested, ongoing, previously independent communication\npractices. There is a historical parallel here. Just as alchemists produced the amalgam of\nforces that promised to control materials prior to the industrial revolution, so on-the-\ncome communication theorists plumb the mysteries of association among data files,\nleaving theoretical commitments, research constraints, and impacts on practice as\nquestions to be cleaned up later.\n4.3 Genres and Dissensus\nThe Internet expands the range of preferred genre into the practices of different\nargument networks. Controversy is a chief trade of the cybersphere; dissensus its\ncurrency; attention its measure of value, and difference its evolving movement.\nQuarrels, quibbles, bickering are not dignified genres, of course; nor are assertive self-\nexpressions necessarily emancipatory or even meaningfully informative. Like-dislike\noffers binary choices. Emoticons stitch emphasis. Pushing buttons simulates virtual\naccess to habitus. Big-data collects words and fronts these as windows into human\nbehavior. Ancestry, DNA, friending, and everyday language use become a vast treasure\ntrove of markers for extraction by big-science projects\u2014conducted to discover\nassociations, that in turn can be useful in constructing ever newer games, filters, and\napplications. Network subjectivity as play enfolds publics into the mechanisms of\nexchange, but playful enclosures discount routinely the traditional commitments of\npractice\u2014even while calling users into the genres of asserting preference, quarrelling\nover rules for judgment, and quibbling over tastes. Controversy reigns. In its\nmanifestations as an Internet process and product, argumentation needs to address the\nphenomena of objection, disputation, disagreement and dissent from a double point of\nview.\nThe controversy-elaborating memes are constituted in language games where\ntropes and figures are connected into lively and automated features of play. From a\nmodern perspective, cybersphere argumentation generally appears to l. exhibit\nstructure that figure exchange into a language game; 2. the games may mimic but are\nnot bound by contextual expectations of defined spheres; 3. cybersphere arguing does\nnot result typically in products that are linear in form or additive in inference; 4. the\narguments have self-replicating features which invite duplication, appropriation\n98 through variation, imitation, and use; 5. arguments have self-sealing features that allow\naffective symbols to compete for attention without being open to direct, discursive\nrefutation; and, 6. critical extensions of objections are capable of unsettling conventions\nof production, interpretation, and analysis. Homologically, consider argument from a\npost-modern cybersphere vantage: l. Internet platforms figure an army of players into a\nsimulation. 2. The arguments of such games are those of predators and prey who adapt,\ncamouflage, and evolve tactics to avoid extinction. 3. Practical reason is coached by\ncrowd-like non-linear forms of self-assertion that take off into flights of popularity or\nstampede into self-fulfilling wish-fulfillment. 4. Internet self-replicating features give\nrise to swarms of duplication, appropriation, and a broad range of equivocal human\nparibehaviors. 5. Schools of users flux together swimming within self-sealing currents\nof opinion circulation of shallow depths. 6. The self-organizing chaotic flow of\nnetworked-negations unsettle conventions of production, interpretation, and analysis\u2014\nthe expectations that regulate the uses of argument, tests of validity, and best-practices\nof construction.\nArguably, whether framed by modern conventions or post-modern homologies,\ncontroversy\u2014like mimesis itself\u2014may be said to be grounded ultimately in the mental\nshapes of personal preference. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson (1980) argue that\nmetaphors are mental apparatus that shape the way the world is seen. Tropes are part\nof the rhetorical cognition that govern common sense, filter words, give terms aspect\nand meaning, I would add. Lakoff advises liberals distressed about the conservative\nelection not to utilize the metaphors, the frames which anchor conservative thinking\n(Lakoff 2003). The problem is that the new communication technologies have\nmobilized the media\u2019s power to purchase and pass along micro-framed propaganda as\nwell as to particularize and filter events, persons, and issues. The attributed\n\u2018unconscious\u2019 becomes a matter of network routinization. The surfeit of information,\nthe deluge of materials\u2014the speed, ubiquity, and serendipity of its transformation\u2014\ncannot keep out (for long) materials that invade, mutate, counter, expectations\u2014\nmaterials that are exploited in Internet challenges to the control of the public sphere. In\nthis world of competing interpretation of facts, rumors and meme spread, perspective is\ndifficult and secured, informed judgment remains in constant precarious standing.\nMimetics opens up a brave new world for studying the competition of spreading\nsymbols that work in a \u201cviral\u201d manner to infect people with notions that are protected.\nready to spread, with self-supplied motivation. Further, the analogies to contamination\nsuggest that the more successful transfers are more capable of being replicated while\nthe environment will eliminate most. Finally, the spread of memes is like the traffic of\nhot tropes, odd figures or colorful lines that get repeated only to become \u2018dormant\u2019 or\npart of everyday life. A dormant meme or trope, however, can be reanimated once the\nright conditions evolve or are manufactured.\nThe Internet goads communicative activism; that is, citizen-cum-users challenge\nnorms that regulate Internet stringing of argument, tests of validity, and best-practices.\nThus, controversy-generating memes course through and entangle personal,\ninstitutional, and political arguments while reshaping, twisting, evolving arguments\ndesigned to compete in the swirl of opinion about topics under discussion as well as the\nways in which they are articulated. In hot pockets, dissensus may be capable of\ntransforming vulnerable, fragile modern industrial-based systems of communication. It\n99 may be that the quarrel, quibble and bicker are but growing pains to an operation that\npromises more wiki-like, knowledge sharing, convergence of expert and citizen\nactivities dedicated to building extended, valid, informed personal, professional and\npublic virtual spheres.\n5. Cybersphere Argument\nThe cybersphere offers a novel media that is rapidly evolving global spaces for\nthe publishing and circulation of argumentation. Modern studies in argumentation\nfeature interaction between speaker and audience, conversations between\ninterlocutors, discussions within institutions, civic address, and public performances.\nConsensus is the goal of informed reasoning and critically thinking its means. The\ncybersphere absorbs modern practices through digital conversation, platforming,\ndistributing and circulating communications exchanges around the globe. The broad,\nchanging constraints of context still parse human activities of reasoning and exchange;\nbut, the Internet builds a parallel world from conversion of analog practices to new\nexperimental spaces. Dissensus is an intrinsic feature of the cybersphere; difference not\nidentity is its connecting work. Communicative activism potentially renders all\npractices, rules, and norms of practice controversial. On line activism feeds network\nchange that serves the economic driven interests of the industry. Media oligopolies\nbuild out networks to reach audiences through filtering preferences that serve the ends\nof mass media.\nThe paper initiated studies of argument and the Internet in several ways. These\ndeserve to be continued and expanded, including: critique of theoretical descriptions\nthat do not account for dissensus as an intrinsic network feature, description of the\nhybrid spaces where arguments assemble and flow, investigation of memes and\nmimetics as sources to explain and invent network arguments; and, finally identifying\nthe rise of old genre quarrels, quibbles and bickering to new prominence. Dissensus\nwas developed in argumentation theory as an early take on reason and postmodernity\n(Willard, 1986). Other Internet genres grow, particularly those engaging elements of\ncosmological loci and knowledge transfers within and across fields. The problem with\ngrowing pains, of course, is that the simultaneous popularization and trivialization of\ncommunication now renders precarious the capacity for serious and meaningful\ndiscussion and debate\u2014upon which the prospects of pluralistic society, fact-based\nprofessions, and the vital civic discourses depend.\nReferences\nAmerica\u2019s Internet Access: 2000-2015. 2015.

How can dialectics apply\nto such multi-sided issues open to more than just two solutions? I discuss two practical\npossibilities reflecting broad theoretical orientations: issue-based and role-based dialectics. I\nargue that the role-based approach is more in line with the exigencies of actual\nargumentation, especially in competitive political discussions. Still, it is incapable of\ngrasping the specificities of genuine multi-party discussions. As a remedy, I propose the\nnotion of argumentative polylogues \u2013 discussions in which multiple (i.e., more than two)\ndistinct, contrary positions are debated simultaneously. I illustrate how polylogues work by\nanalysing four different argumentative strategies in political deliberations during the 2012\npresidential elections in Egypt \u2013 an important episode in a series of political upheavals\nknown as \u201cThe Arab Spring.\u201d\nKeywords: Arab Spring, deliberation, dialectics, polylogue, strategic manoeuvring\n1. Dialectics, dialogue, and arguments\nWhile the state of public discourse has been considered from the point of view of\nargumentation studies since antiquity, we constantly need to ask the question whether our\ntheoretical notions are well suited to the analysis of such discourse. In this essay, I consider\none way in which they fall short, and propose a way to overcome this shortcoming. Doing so\nwill allow us to better understand the intricate relations between public dialogue and\nargumentation analysis, investigated from various angles throughout this volume.\nIt is the dialectical perspective on argumentation which specifically focuses on the\nrelationship between arguments and dialogues. Dialecticians typically define arguments as\nreasons adduced in support of a thesis defended in a contentious discussion, whether actual\nor virtual (e.g., van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 2004; Hamblin, 1970; Johnson, 2000; Rescher,\n1977; Walton, 1998). Arguments are meant to convince (rationally persuade) \u201cthe other\ndiscussant\u201d \u2013 acting as a critic, or at least a sceptic \u2013 that the thesis is justifiable on the\ngrounds that the critic/sceptic herself has accepted or is willing to accept. This basic\ndialectical framework further includes a normative claim that good (reasonable, rational,\nsound) arguments are best understood as contributions that follow the rules of good (again:\nreasonable, rational, critical) discussions. Good discussions are, in turn, organised two-party\nexchanges in which two dialogue partners-qua-opponents critically test their opposing\n105 positions by going through rounds of arguments and critical reactions (reasons pro and con).\nIdeally, this is an activity of a high error correcting potential \u2013 intelligent and critically\nminded dialectical opponents will mutually eliminate \u201cbad\u201d reasons and arrive at the least\nobjectionable conclusion. These assumptions, which tie arguments to discussions and good\narguments to good discussions, have shaped the dialectical tradition in argumentation study\never since Aristotle (Spranzi, 2011).1\nWhat merits closer scrutiny is, however, the very notion of discussion or dialogue.2\nDia-logues, as opposed to mono-logues, comprise all interactive uses of language (to be\nprecise: actual or explicit dialogues; internal or implicit dialogues are monological\nrenderings of actual interactions; see Dascal, 2005). Depending on the number of\ninterlocutors, dia-logues are a genus that can be easily divided into the species of: di-logues\n(2 interlocutors), tri-logues (3), tetra-logues (4), etc. Across different disciplines (e.g., Chen,\n2010; Kerbrat-Orecchionni, 2004; Sylvan, 1985), it has become common to call a multi-party\ndialogue a poly-logue (\u2018discourse between many\u2019; multi or many means here \u2018more than\ntwo\u2019). Poly-logues are thus all dia-logues which are not di-logues. It is only unfortunate that,\ndespite such clear distinctions, the notions of dia-logues and di-logues are often confused.\nThis happens for at least two reasons. First, the slight difference in Greek prefixes is easily\noverlooked (dia-logue: \u2018through\u2019 discourse; di-logue: discourse between \u2018two\u2019). Second, both\nordinary and academic vocabulary fall prey to the deeply entrenched practice of limiting a\ndia-logue to a di-logue: dialogue becomes basically an interaction between two speakers, and\nargumentative dialogue (or discussion) is characteristically theorised as an exchange of\nreasons and criticisms between only two arguers (proponent-opponent, protagonist-\nantagonist, arguer-critic).3\nQuite expectedly, analysts of interaction are critical of such an extrapolation of the\nqualities of two-party discussions (dilogues) to the entire field of interactive verbal\nexchanges. They contend that many forms of multi-party discussions (polylogues) have\nunique properties that cannot be adequately captured in a dyadic scheme, which models\ninteractions between two and only two speakers (Kerbrat-Orecchionni, 2004; Levinson,\n1988). But do such complications of discursive reality affect in any way dialectical\nargumentation analysis? If so, in what sense? In what follows, I will argue that they do, and\nin both the descriptive and normative sense. In the first place, the simplest form of a\npolylogue \u2013 a three-party discussion \u2013 may require from arguers strategic management of\ndiscourse, which extends beyond simple one-on-one orientation of a two-party exchange. In\n1 A set of very similar assumptions is held by the theorists of deliberative democracy whose \u201ckey proposition is\nthat, in politics, it is not only power that counts, but good discussions and arguments too\u201d (Steiner, 2012: i; see\nBohman & Rehg, 1997; Dryzek, 2010). However, deliberative democrats do not systematically examine\nargumentative discourse in any way which contemporary argumentation theory would find satisfactory (Aakhus\n& Lewi\u0144ski, 2011; Lewi\u0144ski, 2010). Since it is precisely argumentation theory whose raison d\u2019etre is a\nmethodical study of \u201cgood discussions and arguments\u201d, some progress in the understanding of political\ndeliberation can be reasonably expected once argumentation theory takes deliberation into scrutiny.\n2 This paragraph is based on Lewi\u0144ski (2014). Note that I use these terms interchangeably, in the neutral sense\nof verbal interactions. Sometimes, dialogue or discussion are considered a special \u2013 constructive, respectful,\nopen, and truth-oriented \u2013 form of interaction. For instance, Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca (1969: 37)\ndistinguish between (heuristic) dialogues=discussions and (eristic) debates. For Dascal (2005), argumentative\ndebates can take the form of either a (logical) discussion, or (dialectical) controversy, or (rhetorical) dispute.\n3 For the routine of limiting dia-logue to a di-logue in discourse and interaction analysis in general see esp.\nKerbrat-Orecchionni (2004) and Levinson (1988). For a similar tendency in argumentation theory, see Lewi\u0144ski\n(2012: 227ff.).\n106 the second place, a good three-party discussion may be underwritten by rules of rationality\nthat go beyond the dyadic \u201clogic\u201d of moves in a rational di-logue.\n2. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d or \u201cWhat is the problem?\u201d\nTo start with, practical issues4 that trigger deliberative discussions can be formulated\nas either yes/no questions (\u201cShall we park here?\u201d \u201cShould we declare an Islamic republic in\nEgypt?\u201d) or open Wh-questions (\u201cWhere to park the car?\u201d \u201cWhat is the best political system\nfor Egypt?\u201d). Polar yes/no questions allow for only two relevant answers: \u201cWe will park\nhere\u201d or \u201cWe will not park here.\u201d By contrast, in response to open Wh-questions, a genuine\nmultiplicity of options may emerge: \u201cLet\u2019s park in the little street behind the school,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s\npark in the open parking lot around the corner\u201d, \u201cLet\u2019s park underground in the academic\ncentre\u201d (etc.). Such open Wh-questions can be safe when they are \u201cdemanding choices\nbetween specified finite sets of alternative statements\u201d or risky when relevant answers\nconstitute an open-ended set of alternatives (Hamblin, 1970: 216).\nHere, I focus exclusively on practical issues that lead to argumentative exchanges\nover the possible options (that is, over the answers to the questions through which the issue is\nformulated). In the case of polar issues, only two contradictory sides can be discussed\n(yes/pro vs. no/con). By definition, if one of the sides holds, the other does not, and vice\nversa (see Lewi\u0144ski, 2013; Jacquette, 2007).5 Open issues, quite differently, may lead to a\nconsideration of multiple positions (a vs. b vs. c vs. d\u2026). Unless they are some versions of\none another, such positions are contrary: if one of them holds, others are refuted (if we park\nin the street, we will park neither in the parking lot nor in the academic centre); however, if\nsome of them are refuted, no definite conclusions about others can be drawn (if the street is\nfull, we can still choose between the open parking and the academic centre).6 Sides and\npositions are thus two distinct varieties of standpoints (options on an issue) on which\ndeliberators have to decide via argumentative exchanges. Quite obviously, argumentation\nover two opposing sides can and ideally should develop along the lines of some dyadic\ndialectical models. Discussion over multiple contrary positions, instead, amounts to a\npolylogue. Moreover, in an argumentative analysis, parties to a debate can be seen as\nsupporters of given sides or positions; that is, a party is defined by the unique answer it takes\nregarding the question of \u201cWhether to do x?\u201d or \u201cWhat to do?\u201d. In the course of\nargumentation, a party supports its position through arguments and starting points building\nwhat should be a consistent commitment set (Hamblin, 1970; Walton & Krabbe, 1995).\nEventually, a party can be defined as a defender of an individual case, that is, an ordered set\ncomprising the party\u2019s side or position and its commitment set. Based on this: 1) two arguers\n4 I use the term \u201cpractical\u201d issues in analogy to \u201cpractical\u201d reasoning aimed towards (a disposition / intention to\nsome) action. Such issues are posed by a question of \u201cWhether to do x?\u201d or \u201cWhat to do?\u201d \u201cTheoretical\u201d issues\nand \u201ctheoretical\u201d reasoning deal with the questions of truth (\u201cIs x the case?\u201d or \u201cWhat is the case?\u201d).\n5 This applies to traditional bi-valued logic. Tri-valued logic (such as, e.g., used by pragma-dialecticians, see\nvan Eemeren & Grootendorst, 2004) allows for a third option: \u2018X neither holds nor doesn\u2019t hold\u2019 (the \u2018I don\u2019t\nknow\u2019 answer). Finally, proponents of para-consistent logics legitimise the fourth option: \u2018X both holds and\ndoesn\u2019t hold\u2019 (see Sylvan, 1985). While I refrain from embracing para-consistencies, I only note that tri-valued\nlogic does not generate a polylogue in the sense defined above: since one does not have to argue positively for\ndoubt, it does not constitute a distinct position, as defined below.\n6 Note that in the case of safe questions, after having properly refuted all but one contrary position (proposal,\nhypothesis), the last one holds by elimination (via a valid disjunctive syllogism). In the case of risky questions,\nno such conclusion can be reached (the options might be all wrong).\n107 supporting the same position (e.g., \u201cThe revolution must continue!\u201d) are different parties, so\nlong as they express some incompatible arguments in its support (\u201cBecause it will allow us to\nbuild an Islamic state\u201d vs. \u201cBecause it will allow us to build a secular state\u201d); 2) a collectivity\nof participants (e.g., a political party) is taken to constitute one argumentative party so long\nas they consistently argue for a given position (Lewi\u0144ski, 2010).\nFollowing from this, an argumentative polylogue can be understood as a discussion\nthat involves argumentation between multiple parties supporting distinct cases.\n3. What is the future for Egypt?\nContrary to binary practical issues instigated by simple yes/no questions, open Wh-\nquestions can give rise to multi-party deliberations in which a number of positions vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe question are debated. Fascinating examples can be found in the public debates\naccompanying the upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa started in early 2011 and\ncommonly known as \u201cThe Arab Spring.\u201d Due to all kinds of nuances and continuing\ndevelopments across different Arab states in the region, one often cannot easily divide the\npolitical scene into clear-cut argumentative parties consistently defending their positions on\ncrucial practical issues. However, certain sharp divisions have been quite vividly instantiated\nat some junctures of the on-going developments. For instance, in the Egyptian revolution,\nduring the presidential elections in May-June 2012, three political options dominated\npolitical debates: the supporters of the old regime, Islamic parties, and secularists\n(liberals/leftists). Indeed, in the first round of elections in May, most votes were cast for\ncandidates of the Muslim Brotherhood (Mohamed Morsi, 24.78%), pro-Mubarak elites\n(Ahmed Shafiq, 23.66%), and the secular post-Nasserist movement (Hamdeen Sabahy,\n20.72%).7 No fewer than nine other candidates officially ran for the office, each of them with\na distinct agenda and position on the main political issues. Yet, as the voting had shown,\nthese three options were at the centre of public debates back then: Muslim Brothers with their\nconservative Islamic discourse, the advocates of \u201cpeace and stability\u201d of the good old\nMubarak era, and the progressives calling for a genuinely democratic and secular republic in\nEgypt.8 Following the procedures of a multi-party presidential race where no candidate\nreached outright majority in the first round, in the June 2012 run-off the choice was\neventually limited to a dyadic clash between two winners of the first round: one of the\nMuslim Brothers (Morsi) and Mubarak\u2019s last Prime Minister (Shafiq). This, of course, at\nleast temporarily swept away the secularist and progressive voices to the peripheries of\npublic discussion and decision-making, and left them in a serious quandary \u2013 Whom to side\nwith? This quandary resulted in arguments supporting what we may see as rather strange\nshifts of alliances, such as when urban liberals who spearheaded the anti-Mubarak revolution\ncalled for the support of Mubarak\u2019s party candidate so as to prevent the establishment of an\nIslamic republic in Egypt. The dominant secularist position, however, was to choose \u201cthe\nthird way\u201d, that is, to boycott the run-off altogether (or at least spoil the ballot by casting an\ninvalid vote; see Lewi\u0144ski & Mohammed, 2012; Mohammed, 2014).\n7 See, e.g.,: http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/36/122/43126/Presidential-elections-/Presidential-\nelections-news/BREAKING-Mursi,-Shafiq-officially-in-Egypts-presid.aspx .\n8 My focus on these three parties involves a certain simplification for the purposes of the analysis: there were\nmore than just three parties, and the camps behind the three main contenders cannot be taken to be truly\nhomogenous and free of any internal disagreements. My point is to show that even such a simplified account of\npublic debates poses a serious challenge to a dyadic dialectical reconstruction and evaluation of argumentative\ndiscourse.\n108 From an argumentation perspective, the crucial characteristic of such public\ndeliberation is that each party has to craft its arguments against (at least) two political\nopponents who also disagree with one another. That is to say, the discursive dynamics of the\ndebates cannot easily be grasped as a clash, or \u201cdialectics\u201d, of two dominant forces (ancien\nr\u00e9gime vs. new world order). This poses a major theoretical and methodological challenge \u2013\nwhile in many situations political discourse cannot be limited to a simple dyadic dialectic,\ndialectical models of good discussions and arguments are precisely dyadic (Lewi\u0144ski &\nAakhus, 2014). To address this possible problem, in the following, I will use examples of\npolitical statements of the three main contenders for Egypt\u2019s presidency in 2012 (Morsi,\nShafiq, and Sabahy). They provide a simple yet telling illustration of the three-party\ndynamics of actual public deliberation in which arguments are traded on three, rather than\njust two, sides of an issue (see Lewi\u0144ski & Mohammed, 2012; Mohammed, 2014).\nA question arises as to how to analyse and evaluate such a \u201ctriangulated\u201d debate.\nMore precisely, how to carry out discourse analysis for the sake of appraisal of arguments?\nCritical argumentation analysts should be able to judge which of the three positions (Morsi,\nShafiq, or Sabahy) ought to be selected by virtue of being supported by the \u201cbest\u201d (most\nreasonable, critically-examined, plausible) arguments. Under felicitous conditions, Egyptian\nvoters would be in a similar position \u2013 an informed, critically validated decision is the\npreferred outcome of their pre-election deliberation.9 Admittedly, any such deliberation and\nits outcome would depend largely on the particular circumstances of actual argumentative\nactivities. We can nevertheless consider two general ways in which a dialectical\nargumentation theory can grasp such multi-party deliberations. These options, while being\nlargely theoretical inclinations, can also inform an \u201cimplicit theory\u201d of actual practices and\ndesigns of deliberation (Aakhus & Jackson, 2005).\n4. Two types of dialectics\n4.1 Issue-based dialectics\nThe first dialectical approach to analyse a multi-party deliberation can be called issue-\nbased dialectics: it is based upon the Protagorean (et c\u00e6tera) conviction that on every issue\nthere are two sides \u2013 pro and con \u2013 and that to properly examine or decide on an issue is thus\nto juxtapose opposing arguments for and against it (e.g., Schiappa, 2003: Ch. 5). Discussing\nmany options on an issue amounts to pooling all possible pro and con arguments on each\noption. This form of analysis assumes that a deliberative discussion starts with an open\nproblem (see Walton, 1998: Ch. 6; Atkinson, Bench-Capon, & Walton, 2013; McBurney,\nHitchcock, & Parsons, 2007). The \u201copenness\u201d of the problem means that discussants do not\nenter deliberation with a defined position on it and that they do not defend the superiority of\n\u201ctheir\u201d position by making a case, that is, by advancing arguments that consistently support\nthe position. Rather, each participant is supposed to give pro and con reasons on each\npossible solution to the open problem, and to welcome the final weighing of reasons without\nbeing committed to one \u201cbest\u201d option all along.\n9 Note that strategic political reasons (self-interest; possible political and economic gains and losses; regional,\nsectarian, and class loyalties and animosities) \u2013 and not just the idealised \u201ccommon good\u201d \u2013 are surely taken\ninto account by actual political deliberators (see Mansbridge et al., 2010). Yet, they are reasons, and so an\nargumentative discussion not unlike the pragma-dialectical critical discussion (van Eemeren & Grootendorst,\n2004) can develop between supporters of opposing parties.\n109 In the spring of 2012 the chief practical issue for Egyptians was: \u201cWhich political\nleader to support in the presidential elections?\u201d In issue-based dialectics, this open practical\nissue would be broken down into three polar issues: 1) \u201cShall we support Morsi?\u201d 2) \u201cShall\nwe support Shafiq?\u201d 3) \u201cShall we support Sabahy?\u201d In response to these polar questions,\neach deliberator would assemble arguments in the form: \u201cOn the one hand, \u2018yes\u2019 because\n(\u2026) On the other hand, \u2018no\u2019 because (\u2026)\u201d A simple schematic representation of such a\nprocedure where five participants (A-E) deliberate over the three choices is given in Figure\n1. This representation is simple, if not simplistic, as it presupposes that each reason weights\nequally \u2013 while in practice various methods of differentially weighing or ordering reasons by\npreference are used (Karacapilidis & Papadias, 2001); some reasons may be better than other,\nand one good reason (a knock-down reason) may outweigh a number of weaker reasons.\nFigure 1: Issue-based weighing of pros and cons\nWhich political leader to support in the presidential elections?\nMorsi Shafiq Sabahy\n+ - + - + -\n+ - + - + -\n+ - + -\n+\n(+2) (-1) (0)\nA B C D E\n(Morsi, Shafiq, and Sabahy are the discussed candidates; + are pro reasons, - are con reasons; A-E are five\ndeliberating voters who contribute their reasons pro and con the candidates without openly supporting any of\nthem.)\nIt is possible to imagine that some groups of Egyptian voters engage in a polylogical\ndeliberation in which the three options on the table (Morsi, Shafiq, Sabahy) are deliberated\nupon in this neutrality-preserving fashion. This, however, would be surprising for political\ndiscussions in a nascent, revolutionary public sphere, where divisions are clearly articulated\nand debated among opinionated politicians and voters.10 An impartial voter (let alone an\nimpartial politician!) is in a sense a contradiction (see Mansbridge et al., 2010; Mouffe,\n1993). A different dialectical model may thus be needed to grasp the contentious nature of\npolitical deliberation without jettisoning the hope of defining it in terms of argumentative\nrationality.\n4.2 Role-based dialectics\nThe second form of dialectical analysis (as well as organisation) of multi-party\ndeliberations can be called role-based dialectics, since it would approach multi-party\ndeliberation as a clash between arguers fulfilling their dialectical roles, or personae. One role\n(protagonist, proponent) amounts to consistently upholding a position against possible\n10 Cf. Goodin & Niemeyer (2003: 629): \u201cIdeals of deliberative democracy may require that we go into public\ndiscussions with an \u2018open mind\u2019, in the sense of a willingness to change our opinions in the light of subsequent\nevidence and argument. But if everyone came to the process with a completely open mind, to the extent that no\none was prepared to take any position to start with, the deliberations would have nowhere to begin.\u201d\n110 opposing positions and critical questioning of the bearers of the other role (antagonists,\nopponents). In this dialectical approach, arguments are thus co-defined with dialectical roles\nof argumentative parties, rather than with dialectical issues detached from any recognisable\nadvocates. To use Atkinson et al.\u2019s expression \u2013 in what they theorise as persuasion\ndialogues over actions \u2013 positions and arguments are \u201cowned\u201d or \u201cchampioned\u201d by\ndiscussants. By contrast, in deliberation dialogues \u2013 which exemplify an issue-based\napproach \u2013 \u201cthere should be no \u2018ownership\u2019 of options\u201d (Atkinson, Bench-Capon, & Walton,\n2013: 123; see Walton & Krabbe, 1995). Not unlike issue-based dialectic, however, a\ndiscussion is instigated by a problem that can be clearly split up into a series of yes/no\nquestions (\u201cShall we support Morsi?\u201d etc.). Argumentation starts because arguers take up\npositions vis-\u00e0-vis these questions (either \u201cyes!\u201d or \u201cno!\u201d)11 and they move on by making a\n\u201ccase\u201d in the sense of marshalling arguments that support \u201ctheir\u201d position, doing away with\ndoubts, and rebutting criticisms:\nIt is a truism that argumentation always arises in response to, or in anticipation of, a\ndifference of opinion, whether this difference of opinion is real or merely imaginary.\nWhen people argue their case, they are defending an opinion, or \u201cstandpoint,\u201d that\nthey assume not to be shared by the addressee or by some third party the addressee\nmight associate with \u2013 otherwise the argumentation would be pointless (\u2026). The need\nfor argumentation, the requirements of argumentation, and the structure of\nargumentation are all adapted to a context in which doubts, opposition, objections,\nand counterclaims arise. (van Eemeren, 2010: 1; emphasis added)\nFrom this perspective, the whole point of engaging in dialectic is to play one of the\ndialectical roles by building a strong and consistent case (position plus supporting arguments;\nsee above and Lewi\u0144ski, 2013).\nTo schematically contrast this orientation with the issue-based approach discussed in\nthe previous section, think again of five (A-E) arguers deliberating which of the three\nEgyptian leaders to support. To do so in the role-based fashion, they would need to find ways\nof discussing each of the presidential candidates one by one, so that in each case, some of the\nfive discussants are for and some are against. For instance, A and B are for Morsi, and\nagainst both Shafiq and Sabahy; C argues for Shafiq and against the other two; D and E\nsupport Sabahy and criticise Morsi and Shafiq. Eventually, no less than three dialectical\ndiscussions between proponents and opponents would develop (see Figure 2).\n11 As mentioned above (n. 6), the \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d answer cannot be considered a distinct position, as defined\nhere.\n111 Figure 2: Role-based pro and con discussion as a set of dual encounters\nA+B\nMorsi\nShafiq Sabahy\nC D+E\nPROPONENT vs. OPPONENT\n(PROTAGONIST) (ANTAGONIST)\nA+B (Morsi) C (Shafiq) & D+E (Sabahy)\nC (Shafiq) A+B (Morsi) & D+E (Sabahy)\nD+E (Sabahy) A+B (Morsi) & C (Shafiq)\nThese two types of dialectic have been recognised, one way or another, since the\nbeginning of Western argumentation studies in ancient Greece. In her analysis of the\ndialectical tradition from Antiquity to Renaissance, Spranzi contrasts aporetic dialectic\nwhich \u201cconsists of an open-ended examination of different views and does not necessarily\ninvolve more than one thinker\u201d with disputational dialectic which instead \u201cconsists of a rule-\nbound and asymmetric debate between two interlocutors, a questioner and an answerer\u201d\n(2011: 1). The latter, \u201casymmetric\u201d debate is epitomised in Plato\u2019s Socratic dialogues, but\ndoes not cover the entire genus of dialectic. Many contrast it with other methods \u2013 such as\nCicero\u2019s argumentum in utramque partem \u2013 which aim at a \u201cbalanced consideration of\nalternatives\u201d rather than \u201cconversion to the Socratic viewpoint\u201d (Schofield, 2008: 64; see\nCattani, 2005). Today, scholars such as Walton and Krabbe (1995) and Atkinson, Bench-\nCapon, and Walton (2013) similarly distinguish between open deliberation and position-\nbound (action) persuasion dialogues. Yet such distinctions often involve idealised\nassumptions and requirements \u2013 for instance that deliberators should be open-minded and do\nnot favour any option \u2013 which are not always adequate to actual conditions for deliberation.\nIt is noticeable, then, that the role-based approach characterised here realistically\nassumes opinionated and self-interested arguers \u2013 a major advantage over such idealised\n112 models of argumentation, often implicitly used in the theory of deliberation in the\nHabermasian and Rawlsian tradition (see Mansbridge et al., 2010). Deliberation understood\nas a role-based exchange is a decision-making activity in which positions are clearly defined\nand explicitly advocated by given parties, who need to be mindful all along to remain\nconsistent in their argumentative commitments.12 The goal is to select, upon critical\nexamination, \u201cthe best\u201d of these positions.13 There are thus \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers.\u201d This is\nmost likely how our Egyptian voters would argue over the candidate to support in the\nelections. This is an important empirical reason for examining the role-based (rather than\nissue-based) version of analysing pros and cons in a multi-party deliberation. The theoretical\nreason is that most dialectical theories mentioned above in fact model argumentation in this\nrole-based fashion.\n5. Dyadic limitations of role-based dialectics\nAs said before, the basic way to reconstruct multi-party discourse, and thus make it\nready for dialectical evaluation in the role-based model, is to approach it as some form of a\ndual encounter between the pro-party and the con-party. Various well-developed methods of\nanalysing such encounters, such as dialectical profiles used in pragma-dialectics (van\nEemeren, Houtlosser, & Snoeck Henkemans, 2008) or profiles of dialogue proposed by\nWalton (1999) and Krabbe (1999), can significantly support a dialectical analysis. Since\nthese methods capture the step-by-step development of a discussion, they allow us to\nunderstand the strategic dynamics of argumentative exchanges.\nTo be sure, such a dyadic analysis is adequate for a large chunk of public discourse if\nonly because many institutions shape discourse in dyadic terms, such as in court proceedings\nwhere two parties clash. This also happens in political deliberation. The British are so used to\nseeing politics as a bi-partisan business that whenever a third party enters parliament they\ncall it a \u201chung parliament.\u201d In the U.S.A. politics is so much dominated by the Democratic\nand Republican Party that only few \u201cthird-party\u201d or \u201cindependent\u201d politicians ever succeed to\nhold an elected office.14 However, crucially to our example of deliberation in the post-\nMubarak Egypt, in most cases of multi-party presidential elections there occurs an\ninstitutional dichotomisation of the disagreement \u2013 from a number of participants competing\nin the first round, only two frontrunners are set against each other in the run-off. As\nmentioned above, in the 2012 presidential elections in Egypt, out of 12 candidates competing\nin the first round (23-24 May), only Morsi and Shafiq went through to the second round (16-\n17 June). Nonetheless, Shafiq beat the third-place-Sabahy by around 685,000 votes \u2013 a rather\nnarrow margin in a country of 80 million. After this result was made official, the\nargumentative dynamics of political discourse did take a dyadic twist \u2013 there were basically\ntwo main alternatives left. However, many of those who were neither pro-Morsi nor pro-\nShafiq \u2013 notably Sabahy and his supporters \u2013 tried to de-dichotomise the political\n12 By contrast, in issue-based activities, participants can be inconsistent, as they are allowed to insert pluses and\nminuses here and there, change their mind, and reason equally strongly on both sides of each issue.\n13 In the longer perspective, argumentative testing of positions might also pave the way for (an) entirely new\nposition(s) to emerge, through a dialectical synthesis of sorts.\n14 As I was reminded by one of the reviewers, this is partly counter-balanced by the fact that in the bi-partisan\nAmerican political system party discipline and homogeneity is much looser than in the multi-party European\nsystems. Both the Democratic and the Republican Party consist of a number of factions, which on particular\noccasions might line up with members of the other party in terms of a particular vote.\n113 disagreement space and sustain an alternative third (as well as fourth) position to the\ndominating dyad (Lewi\u0144ski & Mohammed, 2012).\nFocussing on the discourse of the three main candidates of the first round (Morsi,\nShafiq, Sabahy), we can ask how their tri-logues can be analysed and evaluated in a dualistic\nframework of role-based dialectics? There seem to be two main ways to do it.15\nWe might approach any multi-party discussion as discussion between two basic\ncamps. The analysis would proceed by finding a certain defining issue being at stake. In the\nArab Spring Egypt, such an issue may be: Shall we have a secular or religious rule? Shall we\nbe pro- or contra-revolution? Shall we build a pluralistic open society or strong government\nled by one party? Depending on the issue, political discourse will divide two sides, to which\ndifferent positions will belong. In the civil-religious state question, secularists and Mubarak\nsupporters will be on one side confronting Muslim Brothers. In the pro- or contra-revolution\nquestion, secularists and Muslim Brothers will be on the same side of the barricade, facing\nthose previously in power. Finally, in the open society versus strong government question,\nsecularists will challenge both Mubarak loyalists and Muslim Brothers as having the same\ndictatorial inclinations. In each case, two-sided dialectics can be \u201cread into\u201d the actual\ndiscourse. Some other positions in the public sphere and the varied audiences of public\ndiscussions can be deemed inconsequential or secondary (e.g., van Eemeren, 2010: 109).\nHowever, despite clear analytic and evaluative advantages, such an approach may be seen as\nunjustifiably simplifying or even reducing the scope of political discourse. Many discussions\nare not easily reducible to two camps, especially when some seemingly insignificant or\npassive \u201cthird parties\u201d do take positions and actively contribute to the on-going debates with\ntheir own unique voices that cannot be subsumed under one of the two main positions.\nAn alternative to analyse multi-party discussion is by understanding them as a\nmultitude of dual encounters. An analyst would again start by splitting the overall\ndeliberation into a network of dyadic discussions. The basic question Egyptian voters were\ndealing with \u2013 \u201cWhich political leader to support in the presidential elections?\u201d \u2013 would thus\nbe split into three yes/no questions \u2013 1) Shall we support Morsi? 2) Shall we support Shafiq?\n3) Shall we support Sabahy? \u2013 that one-by-one lend themselves well to a dialectical analysis\nand evaluation in the role-based fashion. This way requires extensive reconstructions into a\npossibly complicated set of dyadic discussions. The simplest reconstruction would break our\ncommittee meeting into 3 separate dyadic discussions (Morsi vs. Shafiq; Morsi vs. Sabahy;\nSabahy vs. Shafiq; see Figure 2).\nWhile commendable for its clarity and evaluative potential, this mode of dyadic\nanalysis can be guilty of some more or less acute reductionism. First of all, while focusing on\nhow arguments proceed within reconstructed dyadic discussions, it neglects what is\nhappening between them (Mohammed, 2011). It can thus, in some cases at least, overlook\nsome important concerns regarding argumentative strategies and even rationality behind\nmulti-party encounters that do play a role in the entire deliberation. Some examples of these\nwill be discussed below. Second, as is clear in the \u201copponent/antagonist\u201d rubric at the bottom\nof Figure 2 above, this role is dialectically inconsistent. The opponents of Morsi (that is, the\nsupporters of either Shafiq or Sabahy) might have different, even opposing, reasons to\nchallenge Morsi. For instance, for Shafiq, Morsi is objectionable as a radical revolutionary\nIslamist; for Sabahy, Morsi is no good for he has betrayed the main revolutionary ideas.\nShortly, it is an unjustified simplification to put these different parties together in the same\n15 See Lewi\u0144ski & Aakhus (2014) for a thorough examination of these two solutions.\n114 dialectical role (whether as an opponent or proponent). Finally, it is worth mentioning that\nthe final evaluation of a multi-party deliberation in terms of dyadic encounters may face the\nproblem of rationally deciding on the winner. In our dyadic discussions, Morsi may be\nsupported by better arguments than Shafiq, Shafiq by better arguments Sabahy, and\u2026\nSabahy by better arguments than Morsi (Morsi > Shafiq > Sabahy but\u2026 Sabahy > Morsi!)\nThis may happen as there is no simple transitivity in dialectical encounters, for instance due\nto the two opposing parties\u2019 agreeing on different common starting points in each dyadic\nencounter. A puzzling result can emerge: whose arguments are the strongest and whose\nposition should prevail according to the rules of critical testing?\nIn this way, we reach the following problem: issue-based dialectics does not quite\ncorrespond to the actual demands of political deliberations and also to most of the theorising\nregarding argumentative discussions. At the same time, the more realistic and better-\ndeveloped models of dyadic role-based dialectics fail on a different account: they cannot\neasily grasp the multiplicity of simultaneously defended contrary positions. Therefore, a need\narises to carefully consider a \u201cpolylogical\u201d model of a role-based dialectical discussion \u2013 a\nmodel that would allow one to adequately understand precisely these argumentative aspects\nof multi-party political deliberations that remain blind spots in the extant approaches. Below,\nI exemplify some of these aspects.\n6. Argumentative strategies of polylogues\nThe differences between multi-party argumentative discussions (argumentative\npolylogues) and standard di-logues used in dialectical models can be considered in terms of\ntwo basic factors: 1) the strategic choices participants in polylogues make and 2) the\nrationality of their argumentation. These two factors have ever since Aristotle (Topics,\nSophistical Refutations, Rhetoric) constituted the two defining axes of the study of\nargumentative discussions in the role-based approach to dialectics. Today, they are\nsystematically examined in the extended pragma-dialectical theory under the concept of\nstrategic manoeuvring (van Eemeren & Houtlosser, 1999; van Eemeren, 2010). In a separate\ncontribution, I have discussed the distinct constraints and opportunities for rational\nargumentation in a polylogical context, focussing on the problem of polylogical fallacies \u2013\nunreasonable argumentative moves that cannot be adequately understood in a framework for\nevaluation based on a dyadic model of argumentative dialogues (Lewi\u0144ski, 2014). Here, I\nfocus on the problem of understanding the rationale behind strategic choices arguers make in\nmulti-party discussions.\nTo start with, the gap between the ideal dialectical models and actual political\ndeliberations has been widely recognised. Political argument is typically not \u201can argument\nbetween two friends or dialogue partners that happens to be about politics\u201d (Zarefsky, 2008:\n318); instead, it involves multiple audiences and multiple parties. As a result:\nIf one were to imagine the audience as simulating the antagonist in a dialogue, then\none would have to say that the antagonist is schizophrenic or has multiple\npersonalities. Yet the arguer often tries to appeal to these multiple personalities at the\nsame time. (Zarefsky, 2008: 320)\nSuch an appeal to \u201cmultiple personalities\u201d (such as when Sabahy argues simultaneously\nagainst Morsi and his supporters and Shafiq and his supporters) requires special\nargumentative strategies to be put in place. One of them is to develop multiple argumentation\n115 consisting of individual lines of reasoning designed for different opponents or audiences\n(Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969: 21\u201322; van Rees, 2003). Another is to argue as if\nappealing to a universal audience whose concerns rise above the particular points of current\nopponents (Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969: 31ff). Yet another \u2013 to prioritise one\u2019s goals\nand address mainly a primary audience, the chief target of the speaker\u2019s arguments, over the\nheads of secondary audiences, namely, other, less significant parties to a debate (van\nEemeren, 2010: 108\u2013109).\nApart from these strategies, I will briefly illustrate four other argumentative features\nof a polylogue: de-dichotomisation of a disagreement space, strategic ambiguity, redundant\nargumentation, and the predicament that sometimes arises when one must concede a point.\n6.1 De-dichotomisation of a disagreement space\nDascal (2008) has described how arguers often attempt to dichotomise a debate by\nresorting to contradictions implying that the debate revolves only around two mutually\nexclusive and jointly exhaustive sides. Whenever more positions are present and should also\nbe considered, such dichotomisation leads to a fallacy of false dilemma (Lewi\u0144ski, 2014). To\ncounter this fallacy, parties to a polylogue can attempt to de-dichotomise the debate by\n\u201cshowing that the opposition between the poles can be constructed as less logically binding\nthan a contradiction, thus allowing for intermediate alternatives\u201d and by \u201cactually developing\nor exemplifying such alternatives\u201d (Dascal, 2008: 35).\nStrategies of dichotomisation and de-dichotomisation are very clear in the exchanges\nof arguments between Morsi, Shafiq and Sabahy between the first and second round of 2012\nelections. At this stage, Morsi and Shafiq are facing each other in the final battle for\npresidency by appealing to supporters of the candidates who lost in the first round, notably\nSabahy, who garnered massive support. Morsi pictures himself as the only legitimate\ncandidate of the revolution and thus the only choice for Sabahy\u2019s supporters:\nIf they do not support the candidate of the revolution in the way towards stability,\nfreedom and truth, who else will they support? I am sure they\u2019ll support the\nrevolution. (\u2026) I will go on with the challenge of knocking down the corrupt regime.\n(\u2026) I am the legitimate candidate, the candidate of the revolution and the\nrevolutionaries. (http://elbadil.com/?p=48640)16\nShafiq, similarly, tries to co-opt the position held by Sabahy:\nI heard the call for change and I am going to answer clearly. My role will be to lead\nthe change, towards a new Egypt, one that looks towards the future, not towards the\nreproduction of any regime that has ended. I promise the people of Egypt a modern,\ncivil and fair state. (\u2026) I represent the civil state and the Al Ikhwan [the Muslim\nBrotherhood, Morsi\u2019s party] represent the sectarian state. I represent moving forward\nand they represent going backward.\n(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNMigUvRfU)\nNoticeably, both leaders attempt to define the differences between them in dyadic terms\n(\u201crevolution vs. corrupt regime\u201d, \u201ccivil state vs. sectarian state\u201d) while appealing to third\nparty voters. However, Sabahy\u2019s statements made it clear that his position differs\nsignificantly from both second-round candidates. In an argumentative text directed to the\n16 All the sources are originally in Arabic. They were translated by D. Mohammed and used in Lewi\u0144ski &\nMohammed (2012) and Mohammed (2014).\n116 supporters of Morsi (\u201cLove letter to the Ikhwan youth\u201d, see Mohammed, 2014), Sabahy\nelaborately builds his case, concisely summarised in a Twitter message:\nMy position concerning the second round is firm: I am not supporting the\nreproduction of the Mubarak regime nor am I supporting the continuation of the\nhegemony of the Islamic current. (https://twitter.com/HamdeenSabahy)\nSabahy\u2019s arguments show that his chief strategy is to dissociate himself from both Morsi\u2019s\nand Shafiq\u2019s position regarding the future for Egypt (see Mohammed, 2014 for a full\nanalysis). His message is clear: if we want to deliberate, we need to have a tri-logue here\nsince my position cannot be subsumed under one of the two sides in the dichotomy. The first\nargumentative strategy of a polylogue would then be precisely to claim \u201cwe have a polylogue\nhere.\u201d17\n6.2 Strategic ambiguity\nWhile Sabahy tells us his \u201cposition concerning the second round is firm\u201d since he\nsupports neither Shafiq nor Morsi, we still do not quite know what his actual stance on\n\u201cWhat to do in the elections?\u201d is. As in any bi-partisan elections, there are four basic\npositions one can take here: 1) vote for X (here: Morsi); 2) vote for Y (Shafiq); 3) vote but\nspoil the ballot (e.g., tick both candidates or tear the voting card); 4) do not vote \u2013 boycott the\nelections altogether. 1) and 2) are plainly rejected by Sabahy. Options 3) and 4) were widely\ndiscussed in Egypt back in 2012, especially by the revolutionaries who did not vote for\nShafiq or Morsi in the first round. These two options differ in an important detail. Spoiling a\nballot amounts to conceding the legitimacy of the entire process while expressing discontent\nwith the two candidates to choose from. Boycotting the elections amounts to pronouncing\nthem illegitimate or otherwise significantly flawed. These two choices presented a serious\nquandary for Sabahy. If he had called for spoiling the ballot, he would have legitimised the\nelections and their final outcome. He is rather reluctant to do so based on \u201call the reservations\nwe have concerning the electoral process\u201d (\u201cLove letter to the Ikhwan youth\u201d, see\nMohammed, 2014). All the same, by openly boycotting the elections he would have\ndismissed the validity of the process he was just a part of. This might have been seen as a\npragmatic inconsistency driven by the bitterness of the loser. Additionally, with different\ngroups of dissatisfied voters arguing over these two options, openly advocating one of them\nmight antagonise other groups, fracturing the unity of the revolutionary camp. That\u2019s another\nthing Sabahy would like to avoid. All these were strategic concerns of a main public figure\ninvolved in a multi-party/multi-position argument.\nSabahy\u2019s way out of the predicament was to resort to strategic ambiguity (Eisenberg,\n1984). Rather than deliberating over the details of \u201cthe battle for presidency\u201d, Egyptians\nshould lay on Sabahy the highly unspecific \u201cresponsibility to participate in continuing the\nrevolution and in achieving its goals\u201d (\u201cLove letter\u2026\u201d). The need for, or at least the\ninevitability of, a radical systemic change in Egypt seems to have been the common starting\npoint of all the parties at this stage. Even Shafiq, an ex-regime official no doubt supported by\nreactionary sections of the electorate, pronounces that his \u201crole will be to lead the change,\ntowards a new Egypt\u201d (see above). However vague, the revolutionary call allows Sabahy to\ndiscursively ally himself with a greater number of revolutionaries than he would have had,\n17 As discussed in Lewi\u0144ski & Aakhus (2014) this would be a strategy belonging to \u201cthe confrontation stage\u201d of\na polylogue. See van Eemeren & Grootendorst (2004) for the division of a dialectical discussion into four\nstages: confrontation, opening, argumentation, and concluding.\n117 had he expressed a clear position on his electoral choices. In this way, he can strategically\nmanage the multiple parties he addresses and multiple goals he needs to reconcile. While\nsuch ambiguities might be taken to constitute a somewhat deflated, if not corrupt, version of\nthe much lauded appeals to the universal audience, they might be seen as contextually\nrational solutions in a polylogical setting: \u201cParticularly in turbulent environments, ambiguous\ncommunication is not a kind of fudging, but rather a rational method used by communicators\nto orient toward multiple goals\u201d (Eisenberg, 1984: 238-239).\n6.3 Seemingly redundant argumentation\nAs mentioned above, one of the strategic solutions to managing multiple opponents in\nan argumentative polylogue is to advance multiple argumentation, in which independent lines\nof support for a position are addressed to different opponents (Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca,\n1969: 21-22; van Rees, 2003). A difficulty for an arguer arises whenever different parties\ns/he addresses have themselves opposing reasons for challenging or doubting the arguer. S/he\nmay end up producing inconsistent or irrelevant lines of argumentation (Bonevac, 2003): a\npresidential candidate in Egypt trying to convince of his credentials both the Islamists and\nprogressive leftists may indeed find contradicting himself while simultaneously addressing\ntheir concerns (\u201cIslam will dictate our laws but we will build an open secular state\u201d).\nThis was clear in Egyptian elections. Shafiq, the ex-regime candidate, openly\nchallenged Morsi for his religious narrow-mindedness and conservatism in a pluralist\nEgyptian society:\nI represent the civil state and the Al Ikhwan [the Muslim Brotherhood] represent the\nsectarian state. I represent moving forward and they represent going backward. (\u2026) I\nrepresent Egypt, all of Egypt and they represent a reclusive group that does not accept\nothers. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNMigUvRfU)\nOnly two days earlier, Morsi\u2019s issued an anticipated rebuttal of these arguments:\nMy program allows freedom for all, whether Christians or women. If I win\npresidency, I will not restrict the freedom of women. Every female citizen has the\nright to choose how to dress. I am not going to impose Hijab.\n(http://elbadil.com/?p=48640)\nSuch a rebuttal, under felicitous conditions, might have swung some of the voters leaning\ntowards Shafiq into supporting Morsi as a tolerant and inclusive figure. However, Morsi did\nnot stop at that. Attracting some of the voters moderately comfortable with Shafiq and the\nways of the old regime was not his only task. He also needed to appeal to Sabahy\u2019s\nsupporters left without their leader to vote for in the run-off. They would surely be happy\nwith the message above, but they also doubted Morsi\u2019s allegiance to the aims of the\nrevolution. Morsi was swift in addressing this third party to a debate:\nI will go on with the challenge of knocking down the corrupt regime. There is no\nspace for corruption. (\u2026) I am the legitimate candidate, the candidate of the\nrevolution and the revolutionaries. (http://elbadil.com/?p=48640)\nIn this way, Morsi defends his revolutionary credentials and dedication to change. On\na strict dialectical reading, in a discussion between Morsi and Shafiq \u2013 the main discussion in\nthe presidential run-off \u2013 this would amount to advancing superfluous or redundant\narguments. Why stress the zeal in \u201cknocking down the corrupt regime\u201d when the social and\nreligious freedom argued for before made a cogent case for supporting Morsi? Moreover,\nMorsi\u2019s revolutionary arguments may be self-defeating: for reactionary voters being\n118 staunchly on the side of the revolution may actually count as a strong disadvantage. What is\nthen the relevance of these arguments in a strict dialectical sense? Quite clearly, Morsi uses\nthem to defend his position in the dispute he is simultaneously having with the supporters of\nSabahy. He is thus possibly running into an inconsistency: \u201cVote for me, I\u2019m an inclusive\npolitician, but I will knock you down.\u201d To avoid it in the electoral polylogue, he would need\nto better strategically manage his responses to different sources of disagreement, rather than\nsimply focus on one dyadic encounter (with Shafiq or Sabahy) at a time.18 To use a concept\ndeveloped in pragma-dialectics, he would need to resort to strategic manoeuvring not only\n\u201cwithin\u201d one dialectical discussion, but also \u201cbetween\u201d or \u201cacross\u201d such discussions \u2013 a\npossibility not fully considered by the originators of the concept (van Eemeren & Houtlosser,\n1999; van Eemeren, 2010; see Mohammed, 2011). Simply put, what happens in one\ndiscussion (say, between Morsi and Shafiq) is significantly affected by what happens in\nanother one (Morsi and Sabahy). And it is exactly the study of the intricate relations between\nthese discussions, rather than within them, that is crucial to understanding such moves.\nNoticeably, they are elusive for dyadic analysis.\n6.4 Giving up a conceded point\nFor the last illustration of polylogical complications in argumentation, I will use an\nexample, which is constructed, yet based on actual political discussions in Egyptian elections\nof 2012. Let us assume that five discussants argue over whom to vote for in the first round of\nelections. Arguers A and B lean towards supporting Morsi (the chairman of the Muslim\nBrotherhood\u2019s Freedom and Justice Party), C favours Shafiq (ex-Mubarak official), and D\nand E support Sabahy (a progressive secularist) (see Figure 2). Consider the following\npossible exchange in which A and B try to convince C of Morsi\u2019s political experience. C\nobjects to most arguments, but eventually A with B find what seems to be a strong point:\nA+B: Well, but you have to agree that he is now the chairman of the Muslim\nBrotherhood\u2019s powerful Freedom and Justice Party?\nC: Right, he is the chairman, one cannot deny that.\nC\u2019s speech act can be quite straightforwardly reconstructed in argumentative terms as a\nconcession, one of the three main types of commitments distinguished by Walton & Krabbe\n(1995). C\u2019s concession allows A+B to continue building their position from what C (the\nopponent) has admitted. Such ex concessu argumentation is a classic move in the Socratic\ndialogue and in general a specimen of dialectical method. Yet, consider that after C\u2019s turn,\nD+E take the floor:\nD+E: Hold on a second, he\u2019s just a figurehead in the hands of a secretive clique of\nMuslim clerics.\nA+B: How do you know?!\nD+E: He\u2019s nothing but a Muslim Brothers\u2019 \u201csubstitution candidate\u201d quickly\nnominated after the real candidate \u2013 Khairat El-Shater \u2013 was disqualified\nfrom officially running for presidency. He\u2019s simply following the orders of\nthe most powerful among the Muslim Brothers.\n18 Naturally, one can object that Morsi does not really address any of the potential Shafiq voters and instead\nappeals exclusively to the revolutionary side of the barricade. Even if this were the case, one can easily imagine\nthree-party discussions in which such strategic and seemingly redundant third-party arguments do play a central\nrole (see Lewi\u0144ski & Aakhus, 2014).\n119 A+B: Hhmm, you may be right on that... But even if he\u2019s possibly just a figurehead\nnow you have to admit he had some standing among the Brothers as the\nmember of parliament between 2000 and 2005!\nNow, consider that in a dyadic dialectical reconstruction, the exchange between A+B and C\nwould look more or less like this:\nA+B: Well, but you have to agree that he is now the chairman of the Muslim\nBrotherhood\u2019s powerful Freedom and Justice Party?\nC: Right, he is the chairman, one cannot deny that. [some interfering discourse]\nA+B: Hhmm, he\u2019s possibly just a figurehead now.\nIn this example, C concedes A+B\u2019s point, but D+E do not, and so they keep questioning the\npoint. Eventually, A+B cannot but give up their point upon D+E\u2019s critique. As a result, in a\ndialectically reconstructed A+B vs. C discussion, A+B rather inexplicably abandon a point\nconceded by an opponent, which amounts to an own goal scored for no apparent reason. That\nis to say, we would find it very hard to account for such a move in terms of a dialectical\nstrategy: why did A+B give up the conceded point with no critical pressure? Mind you, it is\nnot necessarily a fallacious move; some dialectical theories such as pragma-dialectics leave\nthe unconditional right to retract commitments (van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 2004: 153),\nothers only under special conditions in particular types of dialectical dialogues (Krabbe,\n2001; Walton & Krabbe, 1995). The point that needs special attention here is that on the\nbasis of the dyadically reconstructed common ground between A+B and C, C is correct to\nconcede the point about Morsi\u2019s party leadership, whereas on the basis of the common\nground between A+B and D+E, A+B are correct to give the point up (he\u2019s a leader on paper,\nbut not in deed). Hence, while the standing of this point is clear in each di-logue, at this stage\n(before C also retracts his concession) we cannot be sure if it is a starting point in the entire\npolylogue. This may cause some confusion, as described above.\n7. Conclusion\nThe examples analysed here are merely an illustration of a great number of\nargumentative moves in polylogues that become hardly comprehensible when submitted to\nstrictly dyadic dialectical reconstruction. In the (simplified) polylogues of Egyptian electoral\ndisputes, each proponent defending his political position faces disagreement from (at least)\ntwo distinct parties who in turn also disagree with one another. As a result, the opponent of\nmy opponent is not necessarily my ally, but possibly yet another opponent to engage \u2013 a\ncommon situation in multi-party political deliberations. In Egypt, secularist supporters of the\nrevolution may strongly criticise Muslim Brothers for their religious agenda. This does not\nmean, however, that they support the secularist pro-Mubarak or pro-army position. To the\ncontrary, they may be bringing up certain similarities between the Muslim Brotherhood and\nMubarak or army apologists \u2013 for instance the claims to a strong and undivided mono-party\nrule \u2013 that they staunchly oppose.\nSuch constraints and opportunities of polylogical encounters tend to be glossed over\nin role-based dialectical analysis of deliberations where a proponent of a given position faces\nthe opponent of that position in a dyadic exchange. I have argued here that the concept of\nargumentative polylogues would complement the dialectical theories of argumentative\ndialogues and serve as an adequate basis for thorough empirical investigations of multi-\nlateral argumentation. Such investigations can refine our notions of dialogue and argument as\nwell as improve our understanding of the argumentative features of public discourse.\n120 Acknowledgements\nI acknowledge the support of two grants of the Portuguese Foundation for Science and\nTechnology (FCT): SFRH/BPD/74541/2010 and PTDC/MHC-FIL/0521/2014.\nReferences\nAakhus, M., & Jackson, S.

As a case in point, I examine an argumentative\nexchange from the European Parliament (EP), a venue where it is typical that politicians\nattempt to achieve several institutional goals. In analysing the exchange, which is part of\nthe debate on the Conclusions of the European Summit of March 2012, I identify the\npositions taken, reconstruct the standpoints and arguments advanced, and analyse the\ndiscursive choices made in light of the different goals pursued. In the analysis, I am\nguided by the findings of an earlier examination of another EP debate, a debate on\nimmigration in early 2011 (Mohammed, 2013). The arguers\u2019 discursive choices are\nanalysed using the pragma-dialectical concepts of strategic manoeuvring and activity\ntypes (van Eemeren, 2010). The analysis enhances the understanding of the\nargumentative practice in EP debates as a multi-layered activity type in which several\ninitial disagreements are discussed simultaneously and shows that the reconstruction of\nthe argumentative exchanges as a series of several simultaneous discussions is necessary\nin order to capture the strategic design of argumentative moves.\nKey words: Argumentative activity type, European Parliamentary debate, goal, multiple\ndispute, simultaneous discussions, strategic manoeuvring\n1. Goals and strategies in public political arguments\nWhen speaking publically, a politician typically attempts to achieve several goals\nand to address several issues. Whether in an interview, in a rally or in a Parliamentary\nsession, whenever a politician is speaking publically the politician needs to respond to\nmultiple demands: the responsibility of a politician is rarely one-dimensional and public\npolitical discourse is open to individuals and groups that have different interests and\nneeds as well as different commitments and positions. So, for example, it is typical for a\npolitician speaking in Parliament to criticise or praise the government, advocate a certain\nplan, policy or action and promote the interests of his or her constituents. In doing that,\nthe politician can be expected to address issues ranging from the latest statement made by\nthe Prime Minister to the condition of the educational system and some initiatives\nconducted by a small association in his constituency. In order to cope with the limited\ntime they have, politicians craft their arguments strategically to support their case in\nrelation to the several issues they address simultaneously. In this essay, I highlight the\nstrategic discursive choices made by a politician who is arguing in pursuit of several\ngoals.\nParliamentary discourse is a particularly interesting venue for pursuing multiple\ninstitutional goals. In parliamentary debates, the goals that discussants pursue are to a\nlarge extent defined by the roles they play and the functions they are expected to fulfill in\nParliament. Today, parliamentary practices are investigated from interestingly diverse\n124 perspectives. Studies range from political examinations of parliamentary procedures and\ntheir efficiency for achieving institutional goals (Corbet et al., 2011; Judge & Earnshaw,\n2008) to linguistic investigations in which the different discursive patterns in\nparliamentary practices are examined in order to gain insights into the different political\nand social attitudes they reflect (Bayley, 2010; Ilie, 2010). Even though the analysis of\nparliamentary discourse in terms of reasonable arguments and their opposite \u2013 fallacies \u2013\nstarted with the very beginnings of modern European parliamentarianism (Bentham,\n1824), there is still a need for studies that examine the nature and quality of\nargumentation in parliamentary practices. Significant contributions came in the last few\nyears to examine argumentative discourse in different European parliaments (van Dijk,\n2010; Ilie, 2010, van Eemeren & Garssen, 2010; Mohammed, 2008, 2013). These studies\nhighlight the complexity of parliamentary discourse and identify interesting discursive\nstrategies that members of parliaments use in order to balance the different goals they\npursue and to respond to the often-conflicting demands they face. In this essay, I\ncontribute to the study of argumentation in parliamentary practices by examining the way\nin which the multitude of goals pursued in parliamentary practices influences the\ndiscursive choices made by parliamentarians.\nIn line with the research investigating the link between participants\u2019 goals and the\ndiscourse choice they make, I assume that the strategic aspects of discourse can be\nexplained by appealing to the multiple goals1 that underlie the discourse (Craig, 1990;\nJacobs et al., 1991; Tracy, 1984; Tracy & Coupland, 1990). I am particularly interested in\nthe influence of the different institutional goals that politicians attempt to achieve on the\ndiscursive choices they make. Institutional goals are those goals that can be attributed to\narguers on the basis of the type of activity they are engaged in.2 They can be considered a\nsubtype of what Clark and Delia (1979) distinguish as instrumental goals, which are goals\nthat are related to \u201ca specific obstacle or problem defining the task of the communicative\nsituation\u201d (200).\nIn order to highlight the multi-purposive nature of EP debates, I have in an earlier\nwork analysed a plenary debate on immigration (Mohammed, 2013). The analysis\nidentified the different types of institutional goals that are typically pursued by Members\nof the European Parliament (MEPs) in EP debates and characterised general ways in\nwhich such goals shape the argumentative exchanges. The types of institutional goals\nidentified can be considered typical of this type of debate: goals dictated by the occasion\nof the debate, goals related to the powers of Parliament, and goals associated with the\ndifferent identities they assume in Parliament. While the pursuit of the occasion-related\nand powers-related goals gave rise to multiple issues that were discussed simultaneously,\nthe pursuit of the identity-related goals guided the MEPs\u2019 choices and formulations as\nthey addressed the different issues.\nIn this essay, I further investigate the link between the multiple goals pursued by\nMEPs and the discursive choices they make, by examining in detail how MEPs\nmanoeuvre strategically (van Eemeren, 2010) in their attempt to achieve their several\n1 Following Craig (1986, 1990), I consider not only goals, which are intentional, formal, and directly\nresponsible for a certain discourse choice, but also goals, which are functional, strategic, and only indirectly\nresponsible for discourse choices.\n2 Unlike the dialectical and rhetorical goals identified by van Eemeren and Houtlosser (2003), which are\nintrinsic to argumentation and independent of any specific argumentative practice, institutional goals are\nextrinsic and context-dependent (Mohammed, 2007).\n125 institutional goals. As a case in point, I examine a debate from the European Parliament\n(EP), the (relatively) young and fast-growing institution whose complicated structure and\nresponsibility sharing is a good expression of the complexities of European politics. In\nparticular, I focus on those argumentative moves that contribute to the discussion of\nseveral issues simultaneously. I argue that in order to capture the strategic design of such\nmoves it is important to reconstruct multi-issue discourse as a series of simultaneous\ndiscussions (Mohammed, 2011, 2013). The concept of strategic manoeuvring and the\nproposal to reconstruct multi-issue discourse as a series of simultaneous discussions are\ndiscussed in section 2. In section 3, I introduce the case in point, reconstruct the positions\ntaken in it, and discuss them in view of the different goals that can be attributed to the\nMEPs in this case. In section 4, I focus on one particular move and examine how it is\nstrategically crafted in order to bring about favourable outcomes in relation to several\nissues at the same time. The analysis makes it clear that the reconstruction of the\ndiscourse as a series of several simultaneous discussions is necessary in order to account\nfor the several favourable outcomes pursued by means of a single move and the strategic\nchoices made as part of this pursuit.\n2. Strategic manoeuvring in multi-purposive discourses\nIn order to investigate the link between the multiple goals pursued by MEPs in EP\ndebates and the discursive choices the MEPs make in their contributions, the concept of\nstrategic manoeuvring is instrumental. The concept describes arguers\u2019 efforts to get their\npoints of view accepted within the boundaries of reasonableness (van Eemeren &\nHoutlosser, 1999, 2003). In principle, arguers can be expected to try to argue reasonably.\nReasonableness, according to the pragma-dialectical ideal of a critical discussion (van\nEemeren & Grootendorst, 1984, 2003), is a dialectical norm that requires discussants to\nengage in the critical testing of the standpoints about which there is disagreement. But, as\nvan Eemeren and Houtlosser rightly observe, discussants in actual argumentative practice\nare usually not concerned only with finding out whether their standpoints are capable of\nwithstanding criticism or not. Discussants are usually concerned also with being\nrhetorically effective and getting these standpoints accepted. Accordingly, arguers\nmanoeuvre strategically in an attempt to strike a balance between their dialectical\nobligation to test standpoints critically and their rhetorical aim to get their own\nstandpoints accepted (van Eemeren & Houtlosser, 2003).3\nAnalysing public political arguments using the concept of strategic manoeuvring\nis particularly beneficial. In the political domain, maybe more than in any other domain,\narguers are rarely interested in being reasonable only. In fact, one may even say that in\nthe political arena, arguers are generally not interested in subjecting their points of view\nto critical scrutiny but rather in getting others to accept such points of view. Nevertheless,\narguers engaged in a public political argument would certainly not want to appear\nunreasonable in the eyes of their public, at least because this will undermine their\n3 Van Eemeren (2010) emphasises that the assumption that argumentation is aimed at the critical testing of\nstandpoints can be made even \u201cwhen people argue with each other without really wanting to convince each\nother but are in the first place out to win over an audience of onlookers (\u201cthe gallery\u201d), as is the case when\ntwo political rivals are debating each other on television in election time\u201d (1). Even in such cases, arguers\n\u201cstill have to conduct their argumentative discourse with each other as if it is aimed at resolving a\ndifference of opinion on the merits in order to maintain decorum and to appear reasonable to the viewers\nwho are their intended audience\u201d (ibid).\n126 credibility in general. Arguers engaged in a public argument will always try to maintain\ntheir attempts to persuade their audience within the boundaries of reasonableness, or at\nleast within what seems like the boundaries of reasonableness. In order to achieve that,\nthey need to manoeuvre strategically. Indeed, in the political domain, strategic\nmanoeuvring may be considered a necessity (Zarefsky, 2008: 1).\nFurthermore, the examination of public political arguments using the concept of\nstrategic manoeuvring allows for a critical approach to political discourse. Assuming that\narguers manoeuvre strategically presumes that arguers ought to act in accordance with the\nideal of critical testing. Even though argumentative exchanges in the political context\noften fall short of this dialectical ideal, the ideal of critical testing remains an important\nstandard in relation to which the quality of political arguments can be assessed. As van\nEemeren (2010) argues, applying the dialectical ideal of a critical discussion to\nargumentation in the political context is not a utopian endeavour, but rather a critical one\n(4). After all, as he reminds us, the ideal of a critical discussion is by definition not a\ndescription of any kind of reality. It is rather a theoretical standard that can be used to\nprotect the quality of the discussion (ibid).\nLooking at argumentative moves from the perspective of strategic manoeuvring\ncan be particularly helpful for highlighting the link between the multiple institutional\ngoals pursued by arguers and the discursive choices they make. This is mainly possible\nbecause, as van Eemeren and Houtlosser suggest, the analysis of arguers\u2019 strategic\nmanoeuvring needs to be situated in the context of the activity (type) in which\nargumentative exchanges occur. Argumentative activity types characterise the more or\nless institutionalised4 communicative practices in which argumentation plays a central\nrole (van Eemeren & Houtlosser, 2005, 2009). The goals that are pursued in\nconventionalised argumentative practices play an important role in characterising the\ndifferent argumentative activity types. Together with the rules and conventions that\ngovern the practice, they constitute the basis for the characterisation (van Eemeren, 2010:\n144). Activity types that represent argumentative practices in which typically multiple\ninstitutional goals are pursued can be expected to be multi-functional and multi-layered\n(Mohammed, 2009: 51-79). An activity type can be described as multi-layered when\nseveral interrelated differences of opinion are typically discussed by means of the\nargumentative exchanges that occur as part of the practice. Each of the goals that are\nassociated with the argumentative practice can give rise to an initial disagreement to be\ndiscussed in the course of the exchange.\nGiven the multitude of goals pursued in EP debates, the activity type can be\nexpected to be multi-layered. In this activity type, one can expect several initial\ndisagreements as a result of the several goals typically pursued by the MEPs. For\nexample, one can expect initial disagreements about the particular EU policies, plans or\nmeasures to be taken as well as disagreements about the conduct of the executive. The\nformer can be associated with the political power of the EP and the consequent goal of\nthe MEPs to influence the EU policy-making. The latter can be associated with the\nsupervisory power of the EP and the consequent goal of the MEPs to scrutinise the\n4 Van Eemeren and Houtlosser use the term institutional in a very broad sense, to cover not only formally\nestablished organisations but also \u201csocially and culturally established macro-contexts (\u2026) in which certain\n(formally or informally) conventionalized communicative practices have developed\u201d (van Eemeren, 2010:\n129).\n127 conduct of the executive.5 Typically, MEPs craft their contributions in such a way that\ntheir cases in relation to each of the disagreements are supported, often using the same\nargumentative moves.\nIn order to analyse the strategic manoeuvring that occurs as part of multi-layered\nactivity types, the reconstruction of the argumentative exchanges in which the\nmanoeuvring occurs should allow for capturing the role that an argumentative move plays\nin relation to all the initial disagreements to which the move is relevant. Unfortunately,\nexisting methods of dealing with multi-issue discourses do not allow for that.\nTraditionally, the discourse where multiple issues are addressed has been\nreconstructed as a case of multiple dispute (van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 1992: 16-22).\nMultiple disputes typically arise when an arguer brings up two or more issues at the same\ntime. As van Eemeren, Houtlosser and Snoeck Henkemans (2007: 22) explain:\nA dispute may also become (\u2026) complex if, rather than one issue, several issues\nbecome subject of discussion. If for each of these issues a standpoint is taken\nwhich is not accepted, each standpoint necessitates an obligation to defend it, this\nway creating a multiple dispute.\nIn analysing argumentative exchanges in which the dispute is multiple, van Eemeren et\nal. recommend the analyst breaks the multiple dispute into a series of single ones (van\nEemeren & Grootendorst, 1992: 20; van Eemeren, Grootendorst & Snoeck Henkemans,\n2002: 8; van Eemeren, Houtlosser & Snoeck Henkemans, 2007: 22). Breaking a multiple\ndispute into elementary ones helps the analyst get a clear idea of what positions the\ndifferent arguers take and what obligations are incurred on them in view of the positions\ntaken. However, for the analysis of the strategic aspects of argumentative discourse, it is\nnecessary to consider the relationship between these elementary disputes. Especially in\nthis type of discourse, it is often the case that an argumentative move is strategically\ndesigned to contribute to several issues simultaneously. As the analysis in sections 3 and\n4 will show, so much of the strategic manoeuvring involved would go unnoticed if\nelementary disputes that constitute a multiple one were analysed in isolation.\nIn order to capture the strategic aspect of argumentative moves that are meant to\ncontribute to the discussion of several issues simultaneously, I have, in previous work,\nproposed that an argumentative exchange in which several issues are addressed be\nreconstructed as a series of several simultaneous discussions, each of which is about one\nof the issues (Mohammed, 2011, 2013). A discussion, in this proposal, is of course not to\nbe understood in the actual sense of a real life discussion that takes place at a specific\ntime and place. It is rather a dialectical analytic reconstruction of a real life discussion,\ndefined in terms of a standpoint and the argumentation advanced in support of it. Two\ndiscussions are simultaneous if there is at least one argument, or one argumentative\nmove, that plays a role in both discussions without any of the discussions being\nsubordinate to the other. In multiple disputes, when arguers employ moves to contribute\nto the discussion of several issues simultaneously, arguers manoeuvre strategically\nbetween simultaneous discussions. The examination of the manoeuvring that occurs\nbetween the simultaneous discussions is necessary for an adequate account of the\nstrategic aspects of the discourse. The excerpt from the EP debate on the Summit\nconclusion analysed here is a good example.\n5 For another example of a multi-layered activity type, namely the Prime Minister\u2019s Question Time in the\nBritish House of Commons, see Mohammed (2009) where the different institutional goals and the\nconsequent initial disagreement for this interesting practice are discussed.\n128 3. The European Parliamentary debate on the March 2012 Summit conclusions\nThe EP debate on the conclusions of the March 2012 European Council meeting\n(hereafter the Summit) started with a statement made by the President of the Council, the\njust-re-elected Herman Van Rompuy, followed by a statement made by the President of\nthe Commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, both concerning the conclusions of the Summit.\nIn the Summit, the Council discussed a number of topical issues, the most important of\nwhich was the economic policy of the European Union. It also discussed the EU position\nconcerning the participation in international conferences and some other foreign policy\nissues. Additionally, the status of the Schengen Agreement and the enlargement of the\nSchengen Area6 were the subject of some heated exchanges. The fragment analysed is\nabout this in particular.\nDebates on statements are a common practice in the EP. These debates constituted\n24.12% of the total debates conducted in the 6th parliamentary term, i.e., 2004-2009\n(Corbett et al., 2011: 196). In line with Rule 110 of the parliament\u2019s rules of procedure,\nMembers of the Council, Members of the Commission as well as Members of the\nCouncil can ask for permission to make statements in Parliament. The President of\nParliament decides when statements may be made and also whether statements are to be\nfollowed by debates or by brief and concise questions from MEPs instead (European\nParliament, 2012).\nJust like other EP debates on statements, debates on the conclusions of Summits\ncan be seen as an important means through which Parliament exercises its supervisory\npower over the work of the Council and the Commission. The European Council, which\nmeets four times a year, is the top EU political institution. It is responsible for setting the\nEU\u2019s goals as well as the course for achieving these goals. It provides the impetus for the\nEU\u2019s main policy initiatives and takes decisions on thorny issues that other EU\ninstitutions have not been able to agree on (Europa, 2013: 20-27). The Council consists of\nthe heads of states or governments, i.e. the presidents or prime ministers, of all the EU\nmember states, as well as an elected President of the Council and the President of the\nEuropean Commission (ibid). The Commission, which is represented in the Council by\nits president, is composed of 27 Commissioners each responsible for a particular portfolio\non the EU level. As the executive arm of the EU, it is responsible for proposing new laws\nand for seeing to it that EU laws and policies are implemented in the member states\n(Europa, 2011; Leonard, 2010: 58; Staab, 2011: 51).\nThe debate on the March 2012 Summit conclusions went as it is usual for this\nkind of debate. Following the statements of the President of the Council and of the\nPresident of the Commission, there were contributions by representatives of political\n6 The Schengen Agreement, signed in 1985 in the town of Schengen, Luxembourg, led to the creation of\nEurope's borderless Schengen Area in 1995. According to the agreement, countries in the Schengen Area\nabolish passport and immigration controls at their common borders. The agreement is meant to provide EU\ncitizens with the right to travel, work and live in any EU country without special formalities. Furthermore,\nthe Schengen Area functions as a single country for international travel purposes, with a common visa\npolicy. The creation of the Schengen Area is considered as \u201cone of the most tangible, popular and\nsuccessful achievements of the EU\u201d (European Commission, 2013). At the time of the debate analysed, the\nSchengen Area encompassed most EU States (except for Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ireland, Romania and the\nUnited Kingdom), as well as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, which are not EU member\nstates (ibid).\n129 groups7 and then contributions by other MEPs, who spoke under the catch-the-eye\nprocedure.8 In the fragment analysed (see the Appendix), Hannes Swoboda, the President\nof The Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) Group,9 spoke on behalf\nof his group.\nMr Swoboda started by expressing his group\u2019s position concerning the\nconclusions of the Summit, focusing mainly on the issue of the Schengen Area. He said:\nI would like to congratulate the Council on its decision regarding Serbia. I believe\nthat it is the right option for Serbia, for the region and also for Kosovo.\nUnfortunately, no positive decisions were made about Schengen, in particular,\nwith regard to Bulgaria and Romania. The people of these countries deserve to\nhave the Schengen Area enlarged. I hope that this will happen soon.\nHe continued by criticising Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president and a member of the\nCouncil at the time, for a statement the latter had made concerning the Schengen\nAgreement. The MEP said:\nwhat shocked me was the statement by Mr Sarkozy after the Council meeting in\nwhich he said that Schengen should possibly be suspended.\nThe MEP defended his group\u2019s stance concerning the Schengen Agreement, denying that\nthe group is preventing reforms of the agreement as a spokesperson of Mr Sarkozy had\nclaimed. Mr Swoboda went on criticising Mr Sarkozy for not \u201ccommitting to Europe\u201d,\npredicting that he will be losing in the upcoming presidential elections in France. It was\nnot surprising that at the end of Mr Swoboda\u2019s contribution, a French MEP from the rival\nEuropean People\u2019s Party (EPP),10 Jean-Pierre Audy, raised a blue card asking for\npermission to pose a question to Mr Swoboda. Mr Audy, who is a fellow of Mr Sarkozy\nin the French Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), did as expected from him and\ndefended Mr Sarkozy. He argued that the French president wanted to strengthen the\nSchengen Agreement and tried to get Mr Swoboda to admit that the management of the\nSchengen Area was not satisfactory. In his response to the question, Mr Swoboda\ncontinued to criticise Mr Sarkozy and the French authorities under his right wing\nleadership. In particular, he criticised the French role in obstructing the enlargement of\nthe Schengen Area, which he argued undermined their commitment to what he called\n\u201cEurope\u2019s major achievement\u201d. In his answer, the political rivalry between the S&D and\nthe EPP became very prominent. The MEP contrasted the positions of Mr Sarkozy with\nthat of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Mr Sarkozy\u2019s socialist competitor. He said:\nI am standing up for Europe. If Mr Sarkozy does not do this, then that is his\nproblem, but I and, above all, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the French Socialists are\nstanding up for this. For security and freedom!\nThe exchange between Mr Swoboda and Mr Audy ended there, in line with the blue-card\nprocedure, which does not allow the MEP who posed a question to pose another one.\n7 In the EP, MEPs sit in cross-national political groups or remain non-affiliated. At the time of the debate\nanalysed, there were 7 political groups and 27 MEPs remained non-attached (Corbet et al., 2011: 78-128;\nLeonard, 2010: 72).\n8 Under the catch-the-eye procedure, MEPs can try to catch the eye of the Speaker in order to be called to\nspeak. The procedure is meant to provide a chance to speak for those MEPs who were not allocated\nspeaking time in advance (European Parliament, 2012: Rule 149).\n9 The S&D Group is centre-left and was the second largest political group at the time of the debate (Corbet\net al., 2011: 93).\n10 The EPP Group is a centre-right political group (Corbet et al., 2011: 88). It was the largest political group\nat the time of the debate.\n130 Despite its being short, the exchange provides a good example of a political discourse\nwhich is crafted to address several issues in the simultaneous pursuit of multiple goals.\nMr Swoboda\u2019s attempt to achieve several goals was reflected in his contribution.\nThe contribution started by an assessment of the conclusion reached in the Summit:\npraising the Summit\u2019s decision to grant Serbia the status of a candidate member and\ncriticising the decision to postpone taking a decision concerning extending the Schengen\nArea to include Bulgaria and Romania. This could be viewed as an attempt to exercise his\nsupervisory power as an MEP by assessing the conclusions of the Summit. Also in his\nfirst turn, the MEP openly called for the Schengen Area to be enlarged to include\nRomania and Bulgaria, which could be seen as an attempt to influence the EU policy-\nmaking. Mr Swoboda was also clearly trying to promote the interests of his political\ngroup (S&D Group) and the interests of socialists in general. This was particularly clear\nin his defence of the group and attack on Mr Sarkozy, a representative of the rival\nChristian Democrats. It is important, however, to note that the criticism of Mr Sarkozy\nwas presented in the context of supervising the Council and assessing its conduct.\nSarkozy is a member of the Council and was criticised in relation to an issue that was\naddressed in the Summit. This, as it will be shown in the next section, is an interesting\nstrategic manoeuvre.\nThe goals above are in line with the general characteristics of the activity type of\nEP debates on statements (Mohammed, 2013). MEPs in the debate on the Summit\nconclusions were in fact expected to assess the conclusions of the Summit (occasion-\nrelated goal), to influence the EU policy-making in what concerns the issues addressed in\nthe Summit (powers-related goal), and to promote the interests of their political parties\nand groups as well as national interests and the interests of the EU citizens in general\n(identity-related goal). Furthermore, also like in other EP debates on statements, the\npursuit of the different goals shaped the argumentative choices in different ways. The\ngoals of assessing the conclusions of the Summit and of influencing the EU policy-\nmaking gave rise to several issues in relation to which standpoints were advanced and\nsupported, and the goal of promoting the interests of one\u2019s political group guided the\nchoice and formulation of the standpoints and arguments. Moreover, MEPs employed\nargumentative moves that contribute to the discussion of the multiple issues raised at the\nsame time. A good example of such moves is the concession Mr Swoboda granted his\nopponent in his answer to the blue-card question.\nIn his blue-card question, Mr Audy asked Mr Swoboda ,\u201cDo you know that in\ntruth, freedom cannot be exercised without security?\u201d Against Mr Audy\u2019s intention, the\nquestion proved beneficial to Mr Swoboda who responded by saying: \u201cMr Audy, it is true\nthat security and Schengen go hand in hand\u201d and used the concession as an argument to\ndefend his positions in relation to all the issues that he addressed. In the next section, the\nstrategic manoeuvre in the move is analysed, focusing on the favourable outcomes that\ncan be achieved by the move. As the analysis will show, very interesting instances of\nstrategic manoeuvring occur in between the discussions of the different issues that are at\nstake. The strategic design of these moves cannot be captured without reconstructing the\ndiscourse as a series of simultaneous discussions and examining the strategic\nmanoeuvring that occurs between these discussions.\n4. Strategic manoeuvring in the debate on the Summit Conclusions\n131 Overall, Mr Swoboda\u2019s contribution addressed five main issues: (i) the Schengen\nagreement, (ii) the conduct of the Council, (iii) the conduct of the S&D Group, (iv) the\nconduct of Sarkozy, and (v) the French elections. It is important to note here that not all\nof these issues were necessarily related to the occasion of the debate or to the powers he\nacquires as an MEP. The issue of French elections was certainly not. Interestingly,\nhowever, only the standpoint that was directly occasion-related was eventually made\nexplicit. Other standpoints remained unexpressed. This choice of formulation is in line\nwith the institutional constraints imposed in the activity type of EP debates on statements.\nIn this activity type, institutional constraints precondition the allowable issues about\nwhich differences of opinion can arise and be discussed. MEPs who wish to address other\nissues will have to manoeuvre strategically in order to do that. Typically, the\nmanoeuvring involves employing argumentative moves that can play a role in the defence\nof more than one standpoint at the same time, making explicit only the standpoint which\naddresses the issue that is institutionally allowable and leaving the other standpoints\nunexpressed. This strategic manoeuvre allows the arguer to defend standpoints without\nnecessarily making them explicit. The concession that Mr Swoboda granted to his\nopponent did exactly this.\nIn the discussion about the Schengen agreement (issue i), the concession\nsupported the standpoint that The Schengen Area should be enlarged soon to include\nRomania and Bulgaria, as Figure 1 below shows:\n1 The Schengen Area should be enlarged soon to include Romania\nand Bulgaria\n1.1 The people of Romania and Bulgaria\n1.2 Not enlarging the Schengen Area to include\ndeserve to have the Schengen Area\nRomania and Bulgaria is against the law\nenlarged\n1.2.1 Romania and Bulgaria have fulfilled all the conditions\nrequired for joining the Schengen Area\n1.2.1.1a There is security in these\n1.2.1.1b Security and Schengen\ncountries as a result of the measures\nshould go hand in hand\nthat have been taken\nFigure 1\nIn debates on statements, initial disagreements concerning the issues raised in the\nstatements are to be expected given the institutional rules and conventions of this type of\n132 debates. The difference of opinion concerning the Schengen Area and a standpoint about\nit were therefore to be expected. The standpoint was explicitly advanced, and so were all\nthe arguments that defend it. In employing the argument that Security and Schengen\nshould go hand in hand (1.2.1.1b) to defend the standpoint that The Schengen Area\nshould be enlarged soon to include Romania and Bulgaria, Mr Swoboda made expedient\nchoices from the topical potential available to him, adapted optimally to his opponent,\nand used an effective presentational device. The argument is based on a concession\nrequested by the opponent himself, which makes it more likely to be accepted by this\nopponent or at least those watching the debate could assume that. But the concession is\ngranted in a formulation that is also very opportune for the arguer: \u201cfreedom\u201d in the\nconcession required was replaced by \u201cSchengen\u201d in the concession granted, which\nallowed the concession to act as a strong argument in support of the standpoint that the\nSchengen Area should be enlarged. Had the opponent been given the chance to respond,\nhe might have challenged the formulation, but Mr Swoboda was spared this challenge by\nthe institutional constraints.\nIn the discussion about the conduct of the Council (issue ii), the concession\nsupported the standpoint that The conduct of the European Council in relation to\nSchengen is not up to standard, as Figure 2, below shows:\n(2) (The conduct of the European Council in relation to Schengen is\nnot up to standard)\n2.1a The European Council is preventing 2.1b Not enlarging the Schengen Area to\nRomania and Bulgaria from joining the include Romania and Bulgaria is against the\nSchengen Area law\n2.1b.1 Romania and Bulgaria have fulfilled all the\nconditions required for joining the Schengen Area\n2.1b.1.1a There is security in these\n2.1b.1.1b Security and Schengen\ncountries as a result of the measures\nshould go hand in hand\nthat have been taken\nFigure 2\nThe standpoint was not explicitly expressed, but can be easily inferred from the\narguments expressed interpreted, especially if one takes into account the context of the\nexchange and the roles and functions of the EP. In the multi-layered activity type of EP\ndebates on statements, a disagreement concerning this issue is in fact a preconditioned\n133 disagreement. The discussion of the different positions related to the conduct of the\nCouncil is one way through which the EP exercises the supervisory power over the\nexecutives. Given that MEPs and the representatives of the Council know their\ninstitutional roles and powers, the message gets through even when standpoints related to\nthis issue are not made explicit.\nFurthermore, the MEP\u2019s critical stance of the conduct of the Council is supported\nby an explicit argument (2.1a The European Council is preventing Romania and Bulgaria\nfrom joining the Schengen Area). The argument is complemented by the argument that\nNot enlarging the Schengen Area to include Romania and Bulgaria is against the law,\nwhich is the same argument that was also used to defend the standpoint that The\nSchengen Area should be enlarged soon to include Romania and Bulgaria (standpoint of\nissue i). Given the time limits imposed on MEPs speaking in such debates, making an\nargumentative move that can defend several standpoints is very strategic. Like the case\nabove shows, defending the second standpoint (issue ii) could be done by merely adding\none more argumentative move to the arguments that support the first standpoint (adding\nonly argument 2.1a, in this case).\nMr Swoboda\u2019s concession about the link between \u201cSecurity and Schengen\u201d\nsupported his case in relation to the issue of the conduct of the S&D Group as well (issue\niii). The concession was part of a coordinatively compound argument that supported a\npositive assessment of the conduct of the political group. The standpoint was not\nexplicitly expressed, but needs to be reconstructed in order to make sense of Mr\nSwoboda\u2019s argument that It is not true that the S&D group is preventing the reform of the\nSchengen Agreement (argument 3.1). Argumentation in support of this standpoint can be\nreconstructed as in Figure 3, below:\n(3) (The S&D are good representatives of the people of\nEurope)\n3.1 It is not true that we in 3.2b Security and Schengen 3.2a The S&D are standing\nthe S&D are preventing the should go hand in hand up for security and freedom\nreform of the Schengen going hand in hand\nAgreement\n3.2a.1 The S&D are standing up for the ability\nto cross national borders freely\nwithoutpassports\n3.2a.1.1 The S&D want to prevent the\nsuspension of the Schengen agreement\nFigure 3\nMaintaining a standpoint that defends the general conduct of one\u2019s own political\ngroup implicitly was clearly a strategic choice. It is in line with an understanding that is\n134 shared in public political life that explicit self-defence backfires. Making an explicit self-\ndefence standpoint could make the doubts about the conduct of the group even more\npresent, and this is something that is obviously undesirable. However, as we get to know\nfrom Mr Swoboda\u2019s speech, the S&D group had been accused of preventing the reform\nof the Schengen Agreement. The accusation casts doubt on the conduct of the group, and\none could surely expect that this would not be ignored. Mr Swoboda was in a sense\nexpected to defend his political group, and the issue of the conduct of the S&D group was\npresent anyway. Expressing the arguments and leaving the standpoint implicit was in\nsense a good way of addressing the issue while avoiding a backfire. Furthermore, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that the issue of the conduct of the S&D political group is not\none of the institutionally allowable initial disagreements in this type of debate. That may\nalso explain why the main standpoint related to this issue remained not directly\nexpressed. Keeping that in mind, Mr Swoboda left the standpoint unexpressed and\nexplicitly expressed only the arguments that support it. The arguments made the S&D\u2019s\nposition regarding the Schengen Agreement clear, thereby addressing one of the disputes\nthat are allowable in the activity type (an occasion-related dispute). By deciding which\nmoves to make explicitly and which moves to leave implicit, Mr Swoboda manoeuvred\nstrategically in order to support his case in relation to issues that are not typically\naddressed in the activity type without going against its institutional constraints.\nFinally, the concession granted by Mr Swoboda to his opponent was used also to\nsupport Mr Swoboda\u2019s position concerning the conduct of Mr Sarkozy (issue iv) and the\nFrench elections (issue v). The concession that Security and Schengen should go hand in\nhand supported the criticism of Mr Sarkozy, as Figure 4 shows:\n135 (4) (Sarkozy is not a good leader)\n4.4a Sarkozy is not 4.4b Preventing Romania\n4.1a Sarkozy wants the innocent when it comes and Bulgaria from joining\nEU to take a step to preventing Romania the Schengen Area is\nbackwards and Bulgaria from against the law\njoining the Schengen\nArea\n4.1b Sarkozy is digging 4.4b.1 Romania and\nout old nationalist and Bulgaria have fulfilled all\nanti-European relics the conditions required\nfor joining the Schengen\nArea\n4.1c Sarkozy is not\nrealistic\n4.4b.1.1a There is\n4.4b.1.1b Security\nsecurity in these\nand Schengen\ncountries as a result of\n4.1d Sarkozy does not should go hand in\nthe measures that have\nfocus on the future hand\nbeen taken\n4.1e Sarkozy does not\ncommit to Europe 4.3a Sarkozy does not stand 4.3b Security and\nup for security and freedom Schengen should go\ngoing hand in hand hand in hand\n4.2a Sarkozy has called one of 4.2b Calling one of Europe\u2019s\nEurope\u2019s major achievements major achievements into\ninto question in his election question in an election\ncampaign campaign is reprehensible\nFigure 4\n136 And it also supported his praise of Mr Hollande, as the Figure 5 below shows:\n(5) (Hollande is a good leader)\n5.1b Schengen should be 5.2a Hollande is 5.2b Security\n5.1a Hollande\nsupported standing up for and\nsupports\nsecurity and Schengen\nSchengen\nfreedom going should go\n5.1b.1 Schengen is one of hand in hand hand in hand\nEurope\u2019s major\nachievements\n5.1b.1.1 Schengen allows\nEuropeans to cross national\nborders freely without passports\nFigure 5\nThe conduct of Mr Sarkozy was undoubtedly an issue of discussion in the\nexchange between Mr Swoboda and Mr Audy. The two MEPs devoted a good deal of\ntheir contributions attacking and defending him. In principle, the conduct of Sarkozy is\nan issue about which initial disagreements in this type of debate may arise. As the French\nhead of state, he is a member of the Council. The conduct of members of the Council can\ndefinitely be an issue of discussion in EP debates on Summit conclusions. However, not\nall aspects of Sarkozy\u2019s conduct are relevant to the discussion of the conduct of the\nCouncil. Unlike Sarkozy\u2019s positions in relation to the issues addressed in the Summit,\nwhich are legitimate issues of debate in this venue, his merits in the upcoming elections\nare not. This could explain why Mr Swoboda\u2019s left his standpoint concerning Sarkozy\u2019s\nconduct implicit. Possibly, the MEP was trying to avoid making an explicit claim that\nconcerns the conduct of Sarkozy beyond the capacity of the latter as a member of the\nCouncil, in order to keep his contribution within what is allowable in this activity type.\nBut the arguments that relate to Sarkozy\u2019s position as a French president can certainly not\nbe missed.\nMoreover, Mr Swoboda was clearly eager to address the issue of the upcoming\nFrench elections and promote the interests of Francois Hollande, the Socialist candidate\nand Sarkozy\u2019s rival. But this could not be done without explicitly expressing arguments\nthat relate to the French elections (e.g. arguments 5.1a and 5.2a). In order to remain as\nmuch as possible within the boundaries of institutional relevance, he kept most of his\narguments about security and the importance of the Schengen Agreement, which are\nissues that matter to all the citizens of the EU. The MEP made sure that there are many\n137 more explicit arguments that express his commitment to the European project rather than\narguments that reflect only his political rivalry with Sarkozy and his group. In other\nwords, he tried to maintain a balance between promoting the interests of his political\ngroup and promoting the interests of the EU citizens in general, which is a concern that is\ntypical of the EP.\nMr Swoboda\u2019s concession, analysed above, is a good example of argumentative\nmoves that are crafted by politicians to address several issues and achieve multiple\ninstitutional goals at the same time. As the analysis shows, in making the concession, Mr\nSwoboda made opportune choices from topical potential, stylistic devices and adapted to\nhis opponent in order to craft an argument that has the potential of defending several\nstandpoints, some of which were left implicit to avoid undesirable institutional\ncommitments.11 The discursive choices of Mr Swoboda were strategically made in order\nto achieve favourable outcomes in relation to the several issues he addressed. In order to\ncapture the strategic aspects in the design of these kind of moves, the moves need to be\nanalysed as part of what can be reconstructed as several simultaneous discussions. That is\nto say that the analysis should cover the contribution of such moves to the discussion of\nall of the different issues at stake. Such a reconstruction is necessary in order to account\nfor the several favourable outcomes pursued by means of such moves and the strategic\nchoices made as part of this pursuit.\n5. Concluding remarks\nIn this essay, I examined the strategic manoeuvring of an MEP in the EP debate\non the conclusions of the European Summit of March 2012. My goal was to throw more\nlight on the multi-purposive nature of EP debates on statements as well as on the strategic\nchoices made by arguers in the context of these debates. In the analysis, I was guided by\nthe findings of my earlier analysis of another EP debate on a statement, namely the\ndebate on immigration in the wake of the crisis in Lampedusa in early 2011. One of the\nmain findings of the examination of that debate was that some of the institutional goals\npursued gave rise to initial disagreements that could be considered typical in this type of\nparliamentary session and that these disagreements were discussed simultaneously: MEPs\ndesigned their contributions in such a way that they defended their case in relation to the\ndifferent issues at the same time. In this essay, the analysis of the link between MEPs\u2019\ngoals and their discursive choices in EP debates on statements was taken one step further,\nin order to shed light on the strategic design of exactly those moves which contribute to\nthe discussion of several issues simultaneously.\nIn analysing the debate on the Summit conclusions, I focused on a concession that\nwas granted by an MEP to his opponent during the debate. The concession was not just a\nstrategic move in the defence of the MEP\u2019s position in relation to the main issue of the\ndebate, namely the Summit conclusions concerning the enlargement of the Schengen\n11 The standpoints that were left implicit were reconstructed on the basis of two main considerations. First,\nthese standpoints were to be expected because the disagreements related to them were already there, either\nas a result of the institutional roles and powers (e.g. the disagreement about the conduct of the executives,\nwhich is central to the supervisory power of the EP) or as a result of a previously taken position (e.g. the\ndisagreement about the conduct of the S&D, which was initiated by the criticism expressed towards the\nS&D). Second, the standpoints could be reconstructed because the arguments that support them were\nexplicitly expressed. Reconstructing the unexpressed standpoints is necessary for seeing the relevance of\nthese explicit arguments.\n138 Area. The concession was crafted skillfully in order to possibly defend also the MEP\u2019s\npositions in relation to issues that were less central to the debate. By means of the\nconcession, the MEP could address issues that he would be interested in addressing but\nwhich were not necessarily institutionally relevant in the context of the debate. In other\nwords, the concession was a strategic manoeuvre across or between the several issues\ndiscussed.\nThe concession analysed in this essay is a strategic manoeuvre that is typical of\npublic political arguments. Public political arguments are typically multi-purposive\nactivities in which multiple issues are addressed. In order to cope with the multiple issues\npresent in any public debate, arguers resort to argumentative moves that play a role in the\ndiscussion of more than one issue at the same time. These moves, such as the concession\nanalysed here, are designed to bring about favourable outcomes in relation to more than\none standpoint at the time. Furthermore, the strategic choices made and the outcomes\nachieved in relation to one standpoint are not independent from those choices and\noutcomes that relate to the other standpoints addressed. In this essay, I argue that in order\nto arrive at an adequate account of the strategic design of this kind of move, it is\nnecessary that the connections between the different issues are captured. It is in that sense\nthat existing methods of dealing with multi-issue discourses are not satisfactory and that\nthe traditional advice of breaking multiple disputes into elementary ones needs to be\nrevised. In order to capture the strategic design of argumentative moves that are strategic\nacross the several issues discussed, multi-issue discourses need to be reconstructed as a\nseries of simultaneous discussions and the strategic manoeuvring that occurs between\nthese simultaneous discussions needs to be analysed.\nIn addition to its contribution to the study of strategic manoeuvring of these type\nof moves, the examination in this essay also contributes to the characterisation of EP\ndebates on statements as an argumentative activity type. In particular, the examination\nhighlights important institutional preconditions that relate to the initial disagreements that\ncan give rise to argumentation in this type of communicative practice. Consequently, it\nelaborates on the understanding that the activity type of EP debates on statements is a\nmulti-layered activity type in which several institutional goals are pursued and where\nseveral initial disagreements are discussed simultaneously. Two central preconditioned\ndisagreements are the disagreement concerning proposed EU policies as well as the\ndisagreement concerning the conduct of the executives. The two issues are discussed\nsimultaneously as arguers employ argumentative moves that contribute to the discussion\nof the two at the same time. This understanding is important for it highlights the\nargumentative interplay between two important political processes: policy-making and\naccountability. The former is discursively conducted by means of the argumentative\ndiscussion of disagreements concerning policies and the latter is discursively achieved\nthrough the argumentative discussion of disagreements concerning the conduct of the\nexecutives. The two are intertwined. Moreover, a better understanding of the multi-\nlayered activity types of EP debates on statements will hopefully be useful also for the\nexamination of argumentation in other multi-layered activity types. The public sphere is\nfortunately full of these.\n139 References\nBayley, P. (ed.). (2004). Cross-cultural Perspectives on Parliamentary Discourse.\nAmsterdam: John Benjamins.\nBentham, J. (1824).

Secondly, I would like to congratulate the Council on its\ndecision regarding Serbia. I believe that it is the right option for Serbia, for the region and\nalso for Kosovo. Unfortunately, no positive decisions were made about Schengen, in\nparticular, with regard to Bulgaria and Romania. The people of these countries deserve to\nhave the Schengen Area enlarged. I hope that this will happen soon.\nHowever, what shocked me was the statement by Mr Sarkozy after the Council meeting\nin which he said that Schengen should possibly be suspended. Will we have to bring our\npassports again when we come to Strasbourg? Are the many absent members of the\nGroup of the European People\u2019s Party (Christian Democrats) already looking for their\npassports ready for their next trip to Strasbourg? This surely cannot be meant seriously.\nNow, Mr Sarkozy\u2019s spokesperson is saying that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of\nSocialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is preventing the reform of\nSchengen. This is not true. We are not preventing reform; we simply do not want to take\na step backwards. We need to move forwards in Europe and not back. Therefore, I am\ncalling on Mr Sarkozy, in the light of his possible election defeat, not to dig out all the\nold nationalist and anti-European relics. Let us remain realistic and continue focusing on\nthe future. Let us commit to Europe. That would be a good thing for Mr Sarkozy to do.\nJean-Pierre Audy:\nMr Swoboda, you brandished your passport and talked of Nicolas Sarkozy. Do you know\nthat Nicolas Sarkozy has always argued in favour of the Schengen agreements? Do you\nknow that Nicolas Sarkozy does not want to get rid of Schengen, but, instead, to\nstrengthen it? Do you know how the border between Greece and Turkey operates? Do\nyou know that in truth, freedom cannot be exercised without security? Mr Swoboda, I\nhave a question to put to you: do you believe that the Schengen provisions are properly\nmanaged \u2013 yes or no?\nHannes Swoboda:\nMr President, firstly, Mr Audy, I always think of Mr Sarkozy when I pull out my\npassport. I will think of him particularly when he has retired and can no longer pursue the\npolicy that he is currently pursuing.\nSecondly, Mr Audy, it is true that security and Schengen go hand in hand. However, I\nwould like to ask you why the Council \u2013 and the French Government is not entirely\ninnocent in this respect \u2013 is continuing to prevent Bulgaria and Romania from joining the\nSchengen Area, despite the fact that they have fulfilled all the conditions? I would very\n143 much like to ask you this, because now there is security in these countries as a result of\nthe measures that have been taken. Our failure to enlarge the Schengen Area is actually\nagainst the law. I am very much in favour of it, but calling it into question in an election\ncampaign, as Mr Sarkozy has done, is reprehensible in my view. Schengen is one of\nEurope\u2019s major achievements. An achievement of this kind should not be called into\nquestion. Instead, it should be supported because it means that we Europeans are able to\ncross national borders freely without passports. That is what I am standing up for in\nEurope. If Mr Sarkozy does not do this, then that is his problem, but I and, above all,\nFran\u00e7ois Hollande and the French Socialists are standing up for this. For security and\nfreedom!\n144 The United States Supreme Court, Abortion Policy, and the Intersection of Deliberative\nand Forensic Rhetoric\nRonald J. Placone\nCarnegie Mellon University\nrplacone@andrew.cmu.edu\nAbstract: This analysis supports the notion that the modern United States Supreme Court\nis a \u201cpolitical\u201d institution. Further, the written opinions from the Court blend traditional\nfeatures of both deliberative and forensic genres of discourse. The essay analyzes ten\ntexts associated with the landmark U.S. Supreme Court abortion case, Planned\nParenthood of Southeastern PA vs. Casey. The ten texts include the five written opinions\nfrom the Court and five support (amicus) briefs, three supporting the right to an abortion\nand two supporting the Pennsylvania statute on abortion. The amicus briefs, like the\nCourt\u2019s written opinions, combine deliberative and forensic rhetorical principles. The\nwritten opinions and the amicus briefs differ, however. The audience and intent of the\namicus briefs (to influence the Court\u2019s decision-making) are clear, while Supreme Court\nwritten opinions, as blended rhetorical genres, can confuse immediate and future\naudiences and generate ambiguity regarding policy decisions.\nKey Words: Supreme Court, rhetoric, Casey, abortion\n1. Overview\nTraditionally, U. S. Supreme Court written opinions were consistent in both form\nand tone. The majority opinion was the written version of the Court\u2019s consensus.\nConcurring opinions agreed with the conclusion reached by the majority, but disagreed\nwith the reasoning behind the majority\u2019s result. Further, dissenting opinions disagreed\nwith both the result reached by the majority and the reasoning or principles upon which\nthe conclusion was based (Black & Black, 1992: 1092). For most of its history, the\nopinions reflected a norm of consensus and fostered a perception of \u201cunanimity.\u201d The\nChief Justices, especially, controlled the extent of internal debate and conflict and, in\nturn, the external perceptions of consensus (Haynie, 1992: 1158-1169). Debate was\nbehind closed doors, and not through written opinions. The opinions were civil and\nfocused on legal reasoning. Even though there were highly contentious debates\nsurrounding the abortion issue during the Roe v. Wade case in the early 1970s, and\nJustice William O. Douglas threatened to publish a memorandum disparaging his\ncolleagues for putting their own views ahead of the revered institution, the opinions were\ncivil with virtually no indication of the monumental clashes behind the scenes. Justice\nDouglas did not publish his memo so not to undermine the Court\u2019s credibility\n(Woodward & Armstrong, 1979: 187-188).\nThe substance and tone of Supreme Court argumentation has changed since Roe\nv. Wade. Not only are the Court\u2019s conflicts more apparent in written opinions, it is also\nfairly common to identify and chastise a colleague for faulty reasoning or inconsistent\nvoting. A recent study examined Supreme Court written opinions from 1791-2008. The\nresearchers conclude that modern opinions are \u201cmore long winded\u201d and \u201cmuch less\n145 friendly\u201d than those written over the vast history of the Supreme Court (Bloomberg\nBusiness Week, 2015: 35). The challenge for argumentation scholars is to better\nunderstand modern Supreme Court written opinions. Why are they more\nconfrontational? Why have they strayed from formulaic forensic rhetoric? And finally,\ndo different styles of written opinions impact the perceived legitimacy of the Court or its\nrole, if any, in public policy?\nIn an editorial in 2004, The Wall Street Journal, stated the following: \u201cThe\nFounders may have thought they were creating three equal branches of government, but\nthe modern judiciary has taken a more exalted view of itself. There is hardly an area of\nmodern American life (\u2026) into which the Supreme Court has not asserted itself as the\nultimate authority\u201d (Wall Street Journal, 2004: A16). The assertive role of the modern\nU.S. Supreme Court seems particularly evident in the debate over abortion policy. The\nimportance of the Supreme Court in determining abortion policy took center stage during\nthe confirmation hearings on the nominations of John G. Roberts Jr. for Chief Justice and\nSamuel A. Alito Jr. for Supreme Court Justice. Those involved in the confirmation\nprocesses for Roberts and Alito clearly realized that these two individuals might very\nwell determine the future of United States abortion policy. The debate during the\nconfirmation processes focused on a major Supreme Court ruling on abortion, the Casey\ndecision from 1992. That landmark ruling on abortion policy will serve as the object of\ninquiry for this chapter. This analysis explores the Supreme Court\u2019s role in policy\ninterpretation and formation by examining amicus briefs and written opinions from the\nCasey Court. This small slice from the abortion debate illustrates how the traditional\ngenres of discourse (in this case forensic and deliberative) overlap in the public policy\narena. The intersecting genres not only challenge our traditional notions of categories of\ndiscourse, but the language fostered by the intersection impacts public policy. The Casey\nopinion, arguably, has contributed more to the confused state of abortion policy in the\nUnited States than any other written or oral communication.\nI describe this Supreme Court case as an intersection because partisan, political\nrhetoric in the form of supporting briefs was submitted to influence the judicial decision-\nmaking, and the Court\u2019s written opinions combine elements of both political and legal\ndiscourse. What is at stake through this study is an understanding of the multiple\ninfluences on the formulation of public policy. More specifically, \u201cDoes deliberative\nrhetoric shape judicial decision-making?\u201d And, \u201cAre both precedent-based and value-\nladen arguments present in formal court opinions?\u201d I explore the use of precedents and\nvalues because values are generally associated with political discourse and arguments\nfrom precedent are a hallmark of legal rhetoric. The presence of both types of arguments\nin a discourse suggests a blended genre.\nIn Evidence, Argument and Persuasion in the Policy Process, Giandomenico\nMajone (1992) discusses the intersection of arguments across communication spheres and\ntypes of discourse. Majone notes, \u201cWhen science, technology, and public policy intersect,\ndifferent attitudes, perspectives, and rules of argument come into sharp conflicts.\nScientific criteria of truth clash with legal standards of evidence and with political\nnotions of what constitutes sufficient ground for action\u201d (1992). This study helps explain\nhow the Supreme Court may mitigate conflicts in policy disputes, while its rulings may\ncontribute to ongoing disagreements. Further, legal scholars such as Erwin Chermerinsky\n(2002) believe that Supreme Court opinions are \u201cwritten to make it seem that there is one\n146 correct result and that it was derived in a formalistic fashion that excludes individual\nvalue choices\u201d (2012). Through close textual analysis, however, this essay supports a\nfundamental concept from The New Rhetoric, that values are woven into the fabric of\npolitical and legal argumentation (see Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969: 75).\nAs mentioned previously, I focus on arguments based on precedents and those\nbased on values. As a central feature of legal discourse, the guiding principle for arguing\nfrom precedent is the doctrine of stare decisis et non quieta, or stand by the precedents\nand do not disturb the calm. This doctrine is applied throughout the Casey decision. The\nJustices arguing for the majority believe that they are applying the doctrine correctly,\nwhile the minority concludes that the guiding principle is inappropriately interpreted.\nLooking for arguments from values in Supreme Court opinions is not easy. As\nMalcolm O. Sillars (1995) points out, even in \u201ca radical clash of values as in the legalized\nabortion debate\u201d value disputes are \u201cnot as clear as it would appear on the surface\u201d (2).\nTo better understand value-based arguments in Supreme Court argumentation, I\ndifferentiate between value choices and value hierarchies.\nI distinguish value choices from value hierarchies as follows: A value choice is an\naffirmation of a particular value that does not require a linkage with another value. If\nthere is a linkage, it is based on absolutes. One value is desirable, while the other is\nundesirable. For instance, if I value capitalism, I may or may not connect my belief in\ncapitalism to socialism. If I do connect the two, it would probably involve my expression\nof the desirability of capitalism and the undesirability of socialism. On the other hand,\nvalue hierarchies require explicit or implicit connections of values. A rhetor may consider\ntwo values to be desirable, but when linked together, one is more desirable than the other.\nFor instance, I may value both individual rights and collective rights. In the course of my\nargument, however, I may make a hierarchical connection between the two by suggesting\nthat one value is more desirable than the other.\nA value choice, or statement of the preferable, can also become part of a value\nhierarchy. For instance, if a rhetor\u2019s value choice is at odds with another person\u2019s value\nchoice, that rhetor may bolster his/her argument by debating the hierarchical arrangement\nof the competing values. According to Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca (1969), value\nhierarchies may be \u201cmore important to the structure of an argument than actual values\u201d\n(81). In the textual analysis section, I elaborate on the significance of value hierarchies in\nthe arguments from both the Casey opinions and the briefs submitted to the Court.\n2. A Landmark Abortion Case\nThe United States Supreme Court case, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern PA\nv. Casey (1992), is one of the most analyzed judicial decisions in the history of the United\nStates Supreme Court. Casey involved a challenge to a set of restrictions on abortion\nknown as the Pennsylvania Control Act. From both historical and public policy\nperspectives, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern PA v. Casey is a major Supreme Court\ncase since it reaffirmed the central holding of Roe v. Wade, that state governments cannot\nprevent a woman from having an abortion in the early stages of pregnancy when the fetus\nis nonviable. It did not reaffirm Roe in its entirety, however, as the ruling eliminated\nRoe\u2019s trimester framework \u201cby explicitly extending the state\u2019s interest in protecting\npotential life in maternal health to apply throughout pregnancy\u201d (Center for Reproductive\nRights, 2003: 47). In essence, Casey upheld a basic right to an abortion, but provided a\n147 different legal rationale than Roe. The Casey ruling also upheld four of the five\nprovisions from the Abortion Control Act, and thus enabled states to enact regulations\nwith the intent of reducing the number of abortions.\nThis study analyzes ten texts associated with the Casey decision. Five of the ten\nwere generated by the Court. The Casey decision was a 5-4 ruling on June 29, 1992, and\nproduced the following five opinions: Justices O\u2019Connor, Kennedy, and Souter wrote the\nmajority opinion. Justices Blackmun and Stevens wrote opinions concurring that Roe\nshould be reaffirmed, but dissenting from the adoption of the undue burden standard and\nthe use of that standard to uphold the majority of the Pennsylvania law. Chief Justice\nRehnquist and Justice Scalia wrote opinions, both of which were joined by Justices White\nand Thomas, dissenting from the majority\u2019s reaffirmation of Roe, and concurring with the\njoint opinion upholding the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act.\nPrior to the ruling, there were several briefs filed on behalf of the petitioners and\nrespondents involved in Casey. This essay examines five supporting (amicus) briefs\nincluding those filed in support of the right to an abortion by the American College of\nObstetricians, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\n(NAACP), and 250 American historians. I also examine two briefs supporting the\nPennsylvania statute on abortion, which were filed by the United States Catholic\nConference and the National Right to Life, Inc. These five briefs are analyzed because\nthey represent a cross-section of the most involved and passionate participants in the\nabortion debate and are the ones most accessible to lay audiences (these five briefs are\nreprinted in Friedman, 1993).\n3. Textual Analysis\nI begin textual analysis by examining the majority opinion in Casey and how it\nreflects the briefs. Justices Kennedy, O\u2019Connor, and Souter wrote the majority opinion.\nEven a cursory examination of the text indicates that the briefs and the deliberative\nrhetoric surrounding abortion policy influenced the majority. First, it is one of the\nlengthiest Court opinions ever written and the only one to list three Justices as authors.\nThe length can be attributed to the complexity of the issues and the authors\u2019 willingness\nto discuss abortion in legal, historical, medical, moral, and societal terms. The listing of\nthe Justices as authors accomplished two rhetorical objectives. One, it suggested that\nthere was broad support for the majority view. Secondly, listing Justice Kennedy, a\ndevout Catholic, as an author made it more difficult for critics of the decision to charge\nthe Court with insensitivity to religious perspectives on abortion policy. The Catholic\nChurch had been leading the charge to overturn Roe.\nThe majority also explicitly acknowledged different points of view on abortion. A\nfew examples from their opinion include, \u201cAlthough Roe has engendered opposition, it\nhas in no sense proven \u2018unworkable\u2019\u201d (Planned Parenthood of Southeastern\nPennsylvania v. Casey, 1992: 855) and \u201cWhile we appreciate the weight of the arguments\non behalf of the State in the cases before us (\u2026) the reservations any of us may have in\nreaffirming the central holding of Roe are outweighed by the explication of individual\nliberty we have given combined with the force of stare decisis\u201d (853).\nJustices Kennedy, O\u2019Connor, and Souter devote an extraordinary amount of their\nargument explaining the guiding principle of precedent. They say, \u201cwhen this Court\nreexamines a prior holding, its judgment is customarily informed by a series of prudential\n148 and pragmatic considerations designed to test the consistency of overruling a prior\ndecision with the ideal of the rule of law, and to gauge the respective costs of reaffirming\nor overruling a prior case\u201d (854). They elaborate, \u201cIndeed, the very concept of the rule of\nlaw underlying our own Constitution requires such continuity over time that a respect for\nprecedent is, by definition, indispensable.\u201d With the exception of a prior judicial ruling\nthat came to be viewed as a clear error, the Court is obligated to follow precedent.\nAccording to the majority, the Roe decision was not an error, has not been proven\n\u201cunworkable,\u201d and is a \u201crule of law\u201d that cannot be renounced (871).\nSimilar arguments from precedent are present in the briefs. The brief for The\nAmerican College of Obstetricians, for instance, states that stare decisis is \u201ccompelling\u201d\nin the Casey decision. The medical professionals argue, \u201cRoe provides a workable\nstandard that is consistent with constitutional precedent. Roe is therefore not a case that is\nproven \u2018unsound in principle and unworkable in practice\u2019\u201d (Friedman, 1993: 94).\nThe majority draws on a previous Supreme Court opinion for the basis of their\nargument. They cite Justice Harlan in Poe v. Ullman (1961), as follows: \u201cThe full scope\nof liberty guaranteed by the due process clause cannot be found in or limited by the\nprecise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution\u201d (543).\nThis utterance is similar to the argument put forth by the majority. Justice Harlan\u2019s\nopinion was also quoted extensively in the brief filed by the 250 American Historians\n(Friedman, 1993: 139).\nThe following paragraph from the majority opinion summarizes the primary finding\nin Casey, and these words continue to define present day abortion policy in the United\nStates:\n(\u2026) we are led to conclude this: the essential holding of Roe v. Wade\nshould be retained and once again reaffirmed. It must be stated at the outset\nand with clarity that Roe\u2019s essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has\nthree parts. First is recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have\nan abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference\nfrom the State. Before viability, the State\u2019s interests are not strong enough\nto support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial\nobstacle to the woman\u2019s effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a\nconfirmation of the State\u2019s power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if\nthe law contains exceptions for pregnancies, which endanger a woman\u2019s\nlife or health. And third is the principle that the State has legitimate\ninterests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the\nwoman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. These principles\ndo not contradict one another, and we adhere to each. (505 U.S. 833)\nThis core argument can be summarized in three value hierarchies. First, a woman\u2019s right\nto an abortion is superior to states\u2019 interests before fetus viability. Second, states\u2019\ninterests are valued more highly than a woman\u2019s right to choose an abortion after fetus\nviability, except when pregnancies \u201cendanger a woman\u2019s life or health.\u201d Third, states\u2019\nrights are superior to a woman\u2019s right to choose an abortion in the earliest phase of\npregnancy, except when state interests place \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s rights. The\nkey phrase in this argument is \u201cundue burden,\u201d a concept introduced by Justice O\u2019Connor\nin pervious abortion cases. It can be defined as \u201ca state regulation [that] has the purpose\n149 or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a\nnonviable fetus\u201d (Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 1992:\n877). This is a significant point of divergence from the majority opinion and the brief\nsubmitted by the health care professionals. The health care amici curiae provide multiple\nreasons why the undue burden standard should not be adopted (Friedman, 1993: 93-94).\nThey argue that the court of appeals for Casey \u201cerroneously required a high threshold\nshowing of an undue burden and ignored uncontroverted factual findings that each\nprovision [of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act] will cause substantial harm to\nwomen\u2019s health\u201d (Friedman, 1993: 95). Furthermore, arguing that these provisions are\nnecessary to preserve the life of the fetus is \u201cinadequate\u201d because \u201cthe woman\u2019s life and\nhealth must always prevail over the fetus\u2019 life and health when they conflict\u201d (Friedman,\n1993: 95). The latter is a value hierarchy: the value of the woman\u2019s life and health is\nsuperior to the life and health of the fetus. Aside from pointing to different value\nhierarchies embedded in the arguments, this is an example of the deliberative argument\nfrom the medical community failing to influence the majority Justices. While the\nmajority opinion struck down the part of the Pennsylvania statute requiring spousal\nnotification, it upheld the other provisions including \u201crequirements that physicians\ndeliver anti-abortion information to patients, that patients undergo a 24-hour delay before\nhaving an abortion, and that teens obtain consent for the procedure from a parent or a\ncourt\u201d (Center for Reproductive Rights, 2003: 100).\nThe medical professionals believed that they were arguing from a privileged\nposition. In the introduction of the brief, they note, \u201cAs individuals amici members hold\ndiffering views on the religious and philosophical issues that abortion raises. They agree,\nhowever, that when a patient seeks medical care and treatment, such as abortion, state\nlaws should not interfere with a health care provider\u2019s ability to exercise his or her\nmedical judgment in treating that patient\u201d (Friedman, 1993: 82). Put simply, they believe\nabortion is, above all else, a medical issue. Their expertise in health care ensures a\nsubstantial amount of credibility in the abortion policy arena, but they were unable to\nleverage that expertise and influence a major Supreme Court decision to the fullest\nextent.\nThere are other noteworthy textual similarities among the majority opinion and\nthe briefs from the American historians and the NAACP. The academics highlighted the\nhistory of abortion law in the United States, and the amici curiae in the NAACP\u2019s brief\nfocus on the needs of the poor and women of color. In addition to describing the history\nof abortion as \u201ctolerated\u201d practice, the historians point to the role of history as a source of\nauthority for judicial decision-making. They note, \u201cSince the beginning of the Republic,\nno Justice of the Supreme Court has seriously disputed that the meaning of our\nConstitution is to be determined by interpreting its words in light of our nation\u2019s history\nand traditions\u201d (Friedman, 1993: 137). They quote Justice White\u2019s view of the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s role in interpreting the Constitution. According to Justice White, the Court \u201cdoes\nnot subscribe to the simplistic view that constitutional interpretation can possibly be\nlimited to the \u2018plain meaning\u2019 of the Constitution\u2019s text or to the subjective intention of\nthe Framers. The Constitution is not a deed setting forth the precise metes and bounds of\nits subject matter; rather it is a document announcing fundamental principles in value-\nladen terms that leave ample scope for the exercise of normative judgment by those\ncharged with interpreting and applying it\u201d (Friedman, 1993: 138). Therefore, in the\n150 arguments put forth by the historians is the notion that while history is a source of\nauthority in judicial decision-making, these decisions are also time-bound. The majority\nin Casey describes the role of the Court in interpreting history in similar terms. Like the\nhistorians, the majority uses the Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) segregation case as an\nexample of a ruling that \u201cmay have been wrong the day it was decided,\u201d but \u201cthe Plessy\nCourt\u2019s explanation for its decision was so clearly at odds with the facts apparent to the\nCourt in 1954 that the decision to reexamine Plessy was on this ground alone not only\njustified but required\u201d (Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey,\n1992: 863). There is a value choice implicit in these interpretations of the Court\u2019s role.\nBoth the majority and the historians seem to value a Court that does the following: Uses\nhistory as a guide; recognizes changes in relevant facts over time; appreciates the\ninterpretative latitude necessary for Justices to be effective in resolving policy conflicts.\nThe key argument in the brief submitted by the NAACP is that any change to\nabortion policy must reflect the potential impact on poor women and women of color.\nLarge numbers of poor women and women of color lack access to quality health care and\nhave been historically more likely to die from illegal abortions than affluent or white\nwomen. Like the medical professionals, the NAACP amici curiae focus on the undue\nburden standard. Their argument can be summarized as follows: \u201cIn assessing whether a\nconstitutionally protected right is burdened by state law, the Court must consider the\npractical impact of the law on the ability of the individual to exercise the protected right.\nIn this case, the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act would so severely restrict the ability\nof poor women to obtain abortions that it would render illusory the right to make private,\nprocreative choice without state interference\u201d (Friedman, 1993: 118). For the majority in\nCasey, however, only one provision would cause an undue burden. Justices Kennedy,\nO\u2019Connor, and Souter declare, \u201cThe spousal notification requirement is thus likely to\nprevent a significant number of women from obtaining an abortion. It does not merely\nmake abortions a little more difficult or expensive to obtain; for many women, it will\nimpose a substantial obstacle\u201d (Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v\nCasey, 1992: 893-894).\nThe other four opinions also have an array of connections to the five briefs.\nAlthough Justices Stevens and Blackmun voted with the majority, both issued separate\nopinions. The Stevens opinion contains significant value hierarchies. He believes a\nwoman\u2019s right to abort a nonviable fetus is superior to the State\u2019s interest in potential\nhuman life. He says it is \u201cnot a \u2018contradiction\u2019 to recognize that the State may have a\nlegitimate interest in potential human life and, at the same time, to conclude that that\ninterest does not justify the regulation of abortion before viability\u201d (Planned Parenthood\nof Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey, 1992: 914). As mentioned previously, the brief\nfrom the health care professionals contains similar language. Stevens elaborates on his\nvalue hierarchy by linking abortion policy to immigration policy. He notes, \u201cWhile the\nstate interest in population control might be sufficient to justify strict enforcement of the\nimmigration laws, that interest would not be sufficient to overcome a woman\u2019s liberty\ninterest. Thus, a state interest in population control could not justify a state-imposed limit\non family size or, for that matter, state-mandated abortions\u201d (Planned Parenthood of\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania v Casey, 1992: 915).\nJustice Blackmun, like Stevens, disagreed with the joint opinion \u201cfailing to\ninvalidate\u201d the entire Pennsylvania statute. He also expresses surprise and delight that\n151 Roe was not overturned. Blackmun\u2019s opinion is primarily an expression of legal\nphilosophy, a re-statement of his various past opinions on abortion, and a caution against\nfuture attempts to dismantle the Roe decision (Planned Parenthood of Southeastern\nPennsylvania v Casey, 1992: 922).\nChief Justice Rehnquist\u2019s opinion on Casey includes strong language in his\ndescriptions of the joint opinion. He challenges the majority\u2019s argument from precedent\nand calls their interpretation of previous cases a \u201cnewly-minted variation on stare\ndecisis.\u201d Rehnquist argues that Roe should be \u201coverruled consistently with our traditional\napproach to stare decisis in constitutional cases\u201d (Planned Parenthood of Southeastern\nPennsylvania v Casey, 1992: 944). He says that the three Justices purported \u201cto adhere to\nprecedent,\u201d but based their opinion on \u201cgeneralized assertions about the national psyche\u201d\n(Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey, 1992: 957). The majority\ncreated an undue burden standard which is no more workable than the trimester\nframework from Roe. The Chief Justice concludes, \u201cUnder the guise of the Constitution,\nthis Court will impart its own preferences on states in the form of a complex abortion\ncode\u201d (Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey, 1992: 966). He also\nsuggests a significant value hierarchy. Rehnquist acknowledges a \u201cwoman\u2019s interest in\nhaving an abortion is a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause,\u201d but argues\nthat interest is surpassed by a State\u2019s ability to \u201cregulate abortion procedures in ways\nrationally related to legitimate state interests\u201d (Planned Parenthood of Southeastern\nPennsylvania v Casey, 1992: 966).\nJustice Scalia takes a broad view of the abortion controversy. His argument is\ncharacterized by value choices rather than by value hierarchies. For instance, his\ncomments suggest a strong belief in democratic decision-making. He argues that states,\n\u201cmay, if they wish, permit abortion-on-demand, but the Constitution does not require\nthem to do so. The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be\nresolved like most important decisions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade\none another and voting\u201d (Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey,\n1992: 979). He argues that abortion is \u201cnot\u201d a liberty protected by the Constitution\nbecause the Constitution \u201csays absolutely nothing about it\u201d and \u201cthe longstanding\ntraditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed\u201d (Planned\nParenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey, 1992: 980). Like Rehnquist, Scalia is\nalso critical of the majority opinion. He says the undue burden standard is \u201cinherently\nmanipulable and will prove hopelessly unworkable in practice\u201d (Planned Parenthood of\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania v Casey, 1992: 986).\nThe opinions of Rehnquist and Scalia are linked to the arguments in the amicus\nbriefs from the United States Catholic Conference and the National Right to Life\nCommittee. The amici curiae representing the Unites States Catholic Conference believe\nthat Roe \u201cmust be reconsidered and should, on reflection, be abandoned\u201d (Friedman,\n1993: 238). They also argue that precedents prior to Roe must guide the Court. These\nprecedents show \u201cproper balance of individual and societal interests\u2014allowance for\npersonal liberty within a framework that protects human life, represents family\nrelationships, promotes the common good, and preserves our free society\u201d (Friedman,\n1993: 241). The brief submitted on behalf of the National Right to Life Committee\nsupports abortion policy that reflects the State\u2019s interests in protecting life. They believe\nthat deferring to states\u2019 rights is necessary for the undue burden test to be workable. The\n152 amicus curiae declare, \u201cThis Court has recognized that the states have compelling\ninterests in unborn life and maternal health which exist throughout pregnancy. This needs\nto be established in a single, majority opinion, if the undue burden test is to be workable\u201d\n(Friedman, 1993: 277). They also refer to the \u201cweighting\u201d of values that are present in the\nCasey opinions. They argue, \u201cThe critical legal issue to be determined here is how judges\nand legislators are to assign a constitutional \u201cweight\u201d to state and paternal interest in\npreservation of \u2018the individual fetus.\u2019 Without such guidance, the \u2018undue burden\u2019 test is\nunworkable\u201d (Friedman, 1993: 278).\n4. Deliberative and Forensic Genres\nAs a way of discussing the implications of Casey on the formation of public\npolicy, the next section of this chapter explores the research questions introduced in the\nbeginning of this analysis. The Casey abortion ruling suggests that deliberative rhetoric\ninfluences Supreme Court decision-making, and ultimately public policy. There are\nstrong connections among the themes present in the briefs and the lengthy majority\nopinion. Justices Kennedy, O\u2019Connor, and Souter were extremely aware and sensitive to\nthe differing perspectives on abortion. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia, in their\nwritten opinions, even criticize the majority for incorporating public opinion into their\nlegal analysis. One legal scholar, John G. Wilson, believes that public opinion has been\nincorporated into legal decision-making for two centuries, and he calls Casey the \u201cmost\ndramatic recent example\u201d of \u201cpublic opinion\u2019s relevance to constitutional adjudication\u201d\n(Wilson, 1993: 1043). Public opinion is associated with the deliberative arena. It is\nexpressed in elections, public hearings, support and passage of legislation, and through\nvarious forms of rhetoric, including amicus briefs. Supreme Court Justices are arbitrators\nof public policy and must be sensitive to public opinion to fully contextualize\nconstitutional issues. Amicus briefs are a manifestation of public opinion. According to\nstudies by Epstein and Knight, these texts serve an informational role to the Justices\nsimilar to data supplied by lobbyists to members of Congress (Clayton & Gillman, 1999:\n215).\nThe intersection of deliberative and forensic rhetoric is inevitable. Politics is part\nof legal decision-making. Both the briefs and the opinions provide slightly different\nframes to perceive policy formulation. According to Martin Rein and Donald Sch\u00f6n,\nparticipants in policy disputes construct frames \u201cin which facts, values, theories, and\ninterests are integrated\u201d (Rein & Sch\u00f6n, 1993: 145). So while the building blocks for the\nconstruction of the frames are similar, their arrangement may vary. For instance, while\nboth amicus briefs and written opinions contain precedent-based as well as value-laden\narguments, precedent-based arguments provide the foundation for the judicial opinions,\nand arguments based on value choices, judgments, and hierarchies are more prominent in\nbriefs and other forms of deliberative rhetoric.\nThis study supports Thomas Goodnight\u2019s notion that \u201cTo debate the public good\nor public policy presupposes that arguers and audiences have a sense of before and after,\nof that which leads to debate and that which may extend beyond it\u201d (Goodnight, 1982:\n251). Legal argumentation requires a sense of before and after, and the amicus briefs\nserve as examples of rhetoric that incorporate historical and precedent-related data while\nexhorting Justices to decide issues based on probable, future impact.\n153 Just as amicus briefs are a blend of the deliberative and forensic rhetorical genres,\nso are the written opinions. Supreme Court Justices write opinions for multiple audiences\nincluding the legal community, media, general public, executive and legislative branches\nof government, future generations of scholars and citizens, and other Justices. Along with\nmultiple audiences, Justices have multiple rhetorical objectives. It would be inaccurate to\nlabel their discourse as solely forensic rhetoric. Goodnight (1982) defines deliberative\nrhetoric as \u201ca form of argumentation through which citizens test and create social\nknowledge in order to uncover, assess, and resolve shared problems\u201d (251). Justices not\nonly make policy decisions, but their language around those opinions creates social\nknowledge. For instance, the majority in Casey made a policy decision when they stated,\n\u201cthe essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed\u201d\n(Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey, 1992: 846). Their goal was\nalso to create social knowledge that could serve as a guide for other abortion policy-\nmakers. They declare, \u201cState and federal courts as well as legislatures throughout the\nUnion must have guidance as they seek to address this subject [abortion] in conformance\nwith the Constitution. (\u2026) we find it imperative to review once more the principles that\ndefine the rights of the woman and the legitimate authority of the State respecting the\ntermination of pregnancies by abortion procedures\u201d (Planned Parenthood of\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania v Casey, 1992: 845). Blended rhetorical genres are significant\nfrom a policy-making perspective because the objectives of any particular discourse and\nthe intended guidance for policy makers may be unclear. The discourse may be difficult\nto categorize and to follow. The Casey majority opinion serves as an example. The\nmajority settled a policy dispute, but their argument has holes. The opinion is lengthy,\nconfusing (especially the undue burden standard), and contradictory (upholding Roe as\nwell as four of the five Pennsylvania restrictions). In the words of a former law clerk to\nJustice Blackmun, the decision is \u201cthe opposite of coherent, principled decision making\nto which the court should regularly aspire\u201d (Lazarus, 1999: 1485).\n5. Conclusion\nDeliberative rhetoric, legal argumentation, policy-making, and Supreme Court\ndecisions have never been more intertwined. The scope of the modern Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision-making is extremely far-reaching. The Court has become a potent force in the\npolicy-making process and its rules and procedures influence rhetorical strategies.\nGiandomenico Majone (1992) believes that \u201cpublic deliberation has been carefully\ninstitutionalized in all modern democracies\u201d (3). Even the type of briefs analyzed in this\nstudy must adhere to certain criteria. For instance, since 1980, briefs have been limited to\n50 pages, and according to Number 24.6 of the Rules of the United States Supreme\nCourt, briefs \u201cshall be concise, logically arranged with proper headings, and free of\nirrelevant, immaterial, or scandalous matter\u201d (Paddock, 2002: 46). Supreme Court Rule\n37 establishes guidelines for amicus curiae participation. Private interest groups must\nreceive permission from both parties involved in the litigation to participate in the\nprocess, but \u201crepresentatives of federal and state governments are not required to obtain\npermission from the parties to file amicus briefs\u201d (Collins, 2004: 809). Therefore,\nlegislative bodies from the state and federal levels have an open door to participate in the\njudicial process.\n154 It\u2019s difficult to separate the formal and informal rules governing Supreme Court\nargumentation from rhetorical strategies. Justices are bound to follow precedent; the\ninterpretations of precedent often vary widely. These variations are evident in the\ninterpretations of privacy law and the due process rulings incorporated into the Casey\nwritten opinions. Majone believes, \u201cJustificatory arguments play an even larger role in\npolicy-making. To decide, even to decide correctly, is never enough in politics. Decisions\nmust be legitimated, accepted, and carried out. After the moment of choice comes the\nprocess of justification\u201d (Majone, 1992: 31). This description is especially accurate for\nthe Supreme Court. As Roger Stahl observes, the Supreme Court faces the dilemma of\n\u201chaving to make political decisions and arguments while appearing apolitical and\narhetorical\u201d (Stahl, 2002: 442). I think this study supports Majone\u2019s notions regarding the\nimportance of argumentation and persuasion in policy-making, as well as the importance\nof justificatory arguments. Arguing from precedent is a primary strategy the Casey\nmajority employed to justify the essential right to an abortion that had been in place since\nRoe v. Wade. The rhetorical role of precedent in justificatory argumentation can be\nproblematic for other policy makers. Non-legal audiences may not be familiar with the\nprecedents cited by the Justices, and may not share the same frame for the discourse. For\nexample, while the role of precedent is the primary source of authority for Supreme\nCourt Justices, the 250 American historians who submitted the brief argue that the role of\nhistory is the central component of legal analysis. These frames are closely related but\nnot identical. The historians may be more influenced by common law rather than case\nlaw, for instance.\nIt\u2019s not surprising that we spin our wheels on abortion policy in the United States.\nPolicy decisions are vulnerable to political agendas. State legislatures pass abortion-\nrelated legislation, there are subsequent court challenges, and every few years a major\ncase is argued before the Supreme Court. The Casey majority had hoped that their ruling\nwould offer clear guidance, but abortion policy still seems to be surrounded by ambiguity\nand uncertainty. The intersection of deliberative and forensic rhetoric is a tricky one, and\npolicy-makers have much to learn about navigating through its twists and turns. Perhaps\nwe should acknowledge that policy decisions represent, at best, provisional consensus.\nOver time, public opinion changes, political agendas change, and, in turn, laws change.\nThomas Goodnight (1982) points to an evolution of deliberative rhetoric in\ndifferent \u201cforums\u201d and \u201cpractices,\u201d and concludes, \u201cif practices evolve uncritiqued,\ndeliberative argument may become a lost art\u201d (252). The role of amicus briefs in the\npolicy-making process is an evolution of partisan discourse that was traditionally found\nin legislative bodies. The numbers of briefs have increased dramatically (see Collins,\n2004), and to understand and critique how these texts blend deliberative and forensic\ngenres and influence Supreme Court argumentation, I suggest additional studies of\namicus briefs and their relationship to judicial decision-making and the Court\u2019s written\nopinions.\n155 References\nBarrett, P.

With evolutionary changes in the\ncontemporary communication environment heightening both the dependence on and\nimpact of visual images, this study argues that argumentation theory offers important\ninsights for ascertaining which offending images are more likely to re-circulate and\nwhich should prompt consideration of the discourse of apologia. Based on an analysis of\nlist of apologies delivered over four decades by national leaders around the globe, it\nconcludes that images of reconciliation, rather than apologia, produce a more productive,\nlasting argumentative presence in the online environment.\nKey Words: visual argument, apologia, reconciliation, national apologies, recirculation\nArguments occur in many forms. While generally recognized as a critical and\nrecurring component of verbal discourse, arguments are also prevalent in visual or other\nmulti-mediated formats. The rapid expansion and widening reach of the communication\nwithin the online environment positions non-discursive arguments (e.g. photographic\nimages, videos, music, etc.) as critical components of the contemporary public sphere. In\nview of such developments, argumentation scholars have analyzed the functions,\nconstraints, and opportunities of visual argument for more than twenty years (e.g., see\nBirdsell & Groarke, 1996, 2007; Kjeldsen, 2015; Palczewski, 2002).\nThis essay will add to these earlier efforts by analyzing how visual argumentation\nworks in situations of apologia. Political, corporate, and other community leaders\nentangled in publicly salient transgressions often depend on apologies or other forms of\nself-defense strategies to restore their credibility. On September 23, 1952, for example,\nU.S. Vice Presidential candidate Richard Nixon resurrected his floundering political\ncareer by giving a nationally televised act of apologia. His so-called \u201cCheckers\u201d speech\nwas a response to viewers who believed the Vice President had exchanged political\nfavors for a gift of eighteen thousand dollars from his political contributors. Likewise in\nthe corporate arena, Johnson & Johnson restored its public image, in part, through a\nnational campaign of public apologies by CEO Peter Biljur and other company officials.\nThe series of apologies following the 1982 deaths of seven people from cyanide-laced,\ntampered bottles of Extra-Strength Tylenol. On the global level, national leaders have\nsimilarly relied on apologia to revive strained alliances, to moderate inflamed\n* An earlier version of this paper has appeared in Carol Winkler and Cori E. Dauber, (eds). Visual\nPropaganda and Online Radicalization (Carlisle, PA: Strategic Studies Institute, 2014), pp. 1-31\n158 adversaries, to counter their own country\u2019s domestic pressures, and to restore their\ncredibility around the world.\nFor some time, the discursive argumentative strategies of public apologies have\ncaptured the interest of argumentation scholars. Ware and Linkugel\u2019s (1973) seminal\nessay both defines the concept of apologia and identifies denial, bolstering,\ndifferentiation, and transcendence as the four most common approaches speakers use to\ndefend themselves. The same essay contends that various combinations of those four\nstrategies produce four sub-genres of apologia: absolution, vindication, explanation, and\njustification. Benoit (1995) adds denial, evasion of responsibility, reduction of the\noffensiveness of the act, the promise of corrective action, and mortification as the five\nimage restoration strategies appropriate for self-defense.\nDrawing from case studies of various political actors, many argumentation\nscholars identify and explain the strategies available to strengthen the effectiveness of the\ndiscourse of apologia. Towner (2010), for example, espouses the value of using\nideographs to help foster the strategy of transcendence. Wakefield (2007) argues that\ncritics need to understand both apologia and stasis to avoid overlooking key aspects of\nthe context of arguers\u2019 strategies of apologia. Theye (2008) emphasizes that the framing\nand identification components of societal narratives are useful for facilitating speaker\ncredibility in effective apologia. Finally, King demonstrates how apologists can use the\nmetaphor of tragedy to both remove the self and one\u2019s self motivations from the scene,\nwhile simultaneously positioning the transgressor into an \u201cactive agent with an admirable\nethos\u201d (1985: 290).\nIncreasingly, those examining apologia have focused on the role of the situational\ncontext in defining the argumentative parameters of apologia. Ryan (1982) explains that\nthe appropriateness of certain argumentative strategies depends on whether speakers are\nresponding to accusations about policy or accusations of character. Rowland and Jerome\ndistinguish between situations calling for image maintenance and image restoration.\nThey identify field invariant strategies for apologists seeking image maintenance that\ninclude: \u201cdemonstrating concern for those harmed, bolstering organizational values,\ndenying intent to create harm, and preventing recurrence by seeking the cause of the\nproblem\u201d (2004: 207-08). They resist field invariant argumentative typologies for those\nstriving for image repair due to the wide range of situational exigencies speakers face.\nKoesten and Rowland (2004) maintain that particularly during acts of atonement (i.e.,\nwhen guilt is high), speakers must acknowledge wrongdoing and ask forgiveness,\ndemonstrate a change in attitude, describe a series of steps to present a different type of\npresent and future, demonstrate authenticity, and conduct such acts in public. Nobles\n(2008) posits that legal, bureaucratic, administrative and political contexts each constrain\nthe productive argumentative strategies available for those wishing to issue public\napologies. Finally, Suzuki and van Eemeren distinguish between \u201cthe speech act of\napologizing and the more encompassing action type of apologia...[which] generally\nentails a verbal defense\u201d (2004: 103). They do so to stress the need for scholars of\napologia to consider culture, given the distinctions in east-west audience expectations for\nthose issuing apologies.\nTaken together, the previous studies of apologia share a common, exclusive focus\non the verbal aspects of the discourse. Typically, most argumentation scholars limit their\nstudies of public apologies to either a single speech or a series of speech acts designed to\n159 restore the credibility of the transgressor (e.g., Doxtader, 2009; Tavuchis, 1991). Others\nfocus on better understanding the broader argumentative strategies of apologia\nappropriate for verbal defense (e.g. Ware and Linkugel, 1973; Benoit, 1995). Those who\nexamine cross-cultural apologies similarly utilize verbal texts in their studies\u2019\nmethodologies, as Rentelin (2008) does when she limits her analysis to sets of linguistic\nterms, connotations of words or phrases, and complements.\nVisual argument, by sharp contrast, remains virtually ignored in the available\nscholarship on apologia. Such an oversight is unfortunate, as images do serve as a\npowerful source of both verbal and visual argumentative claims, as will be discussed\nmore below. Accordingly, this essay examines the relationship between visual\nargumentation and apologia through the lens of re-circulated visual images associated\nwith national apologies by political leaders.\nThis study relies on artifacts drawn from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s\nextensive list of apologies that global leaders have offered historically (Political\nApologies, 2003), as well as more recent apologies that U.S. leaders offered in reaction to\nconduct of members of the military fighting in Afghanistan to ensure relevance in today\u2019s\nmedia environment. For each national apology, I entered key terms from the list\u2019s entries\ninto the Google search engine, identified which entries yielded accompanying visual\nimages, limited the group of images to those that re-circulated across media outlets, and\nanalyzed the resulting subset of images for argumentative patterns.\nBased on this examination of visual images associated with national apologies\ndelivered around the globe over the past four decades, I will argue that images linked to\nacts of reconciliation have more lasting circulation in the online environment. As\noffending online images serve as a reminder, if not an ongoing affront, to certain\naudiences across time and space, the process of visual reconciliation emerges as the\npreferable response for maintaining an oft needed, continuing online presence. To\nexplain, the following sections will highlight multiple factors that justify the need for\nunderstanding the role visual argument in national apologies, identify four characteristics\nof visual argument that contribute to image recirculation, and illustrate how resilient\nimages of national apologies in the online environment tend to align with theories of\nreconciliation rather than apologia.\n1. Visual Argument and Apologia\nThe increasing role of visual argument in apologia is emergent for a number of\nreasons. First, visual images are often integral to understanding the argumentative\nfunctions of contemporary public discourse. Based on a review of the argumentation\ncommunity\u2019s scholarship on the functions of visual images, Palczewski (2001) makes the\ncase that the nondiscursive functions in four ways: as an argument, as part of an\nargument, as a response to an argument, or as an element that can participate in an\nargument. Gronbeck adds, \u201cRoughly speaking, a representationist conception of image\nmakes them evidence for claims, while a cultural conception constructs images as the\ninfluential bases of claims\u201d (2005: 492). Images can function both as ideographs that sum\nup the propositional logic of communities (Edwards and Winkler, 1997) and as good\nreasons to counter prevailing societal narratives (Winkler, 2001).\nSecond, visual images also have strong audience appeal. Experimental studies of\nimages used in broadcast news programs and political campaigns, for example,\n160 demonstrate that images draw viewer attention (Drew and Grimes, 1987), bolster\ncredibility and trust (Sundar and Limperos, 2013), and help produce audience recall of\nboth the image and its surrounding messages (Basil, 1994; Fox, 2004; Lang, 1995; Lang,\net al., 2003). Visual images also function to cue themes or societal narratives in ways\nsimilar to how argumentation theorists understand the workings of enthymemes (Griffin,\n2004; Zelizer, 2004; Lister and Wells, 2001). Finally, viewers can more easily and\nsimultaneously process visual images as opposed to the sequential processing of verbal\nargument that requires heightened cognitive effort (Graber, 1990; Pfau, et al., 2006;\nSundar, 2000).\nThird, visual images have increasing importance for argumentation scholars due\nto the rapid changes underway in the global communication environment. Online media\noutlets are proliferating (Abdullah, et al., 2005), with an accompanying expanded role for\nvisual images in how media outlets portray national and global news (Greer and Mensing,\n2006). With more than three billion current internet users constituting approximately\nforty percent of the world\u2019s population (Internet Live Stats, 2014), audience news\nconsumption patterns have shifted from traditional broadcast and print mediums to digital\nplatforms (Pew Research Center, 2014). A majority of viewers now prefer photographs or\nvideo to text-based news (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 2004), with\nthe result that audiences are increasingly consuming news through photographs and\nvideos posted on the media company\u2019s online sites.\nFurther, information on the Internet provides the public easy access to sources of\ninformation far beyond the stories that traditional media conglomerates provide. In such a\ndiffuse environment, visual argument takes on particular importance as unexpectedly\nlarge audiences can \u201cwitness\u201d transgressions by individuals or groups. The YouTube\nvideo posted anonymously on January 10, 2012, with the caption \u201cScout sniper team 4\nwith 3rd battalion 2nd marines out of camp lejuene peeing on dead talibans\u201d offers an\nillustration of how offending images can go viral. Within four months of the video\u2019s first\nposting, more than 20,000 follow-up posts of the image garnered tens of millions of\nviews on the YouTube site alone. Even in instances where images do not go viral,\noffending visual arguments can still inspire violent reactions as the example of Jyllands-\nPosten\u2019s twelve cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed makes clear. When re-circulated\nacross time and place in the online environment, offending images do more than simply\nprompt recall of past bad acts; they also function as de-contextualized re-enactments of\nthe offending behaviors. Future viewers can witness the affronts repeatedly online with\nless understanding of mitigating contextual factors that may have occurred at the time of\nthe initial offending behaviors.\n2. Recirculation of Offending Images\nThe vast expanse and reach of the online environment creates challenges for\nidentifying which particular offending images will go viral and which will have lasting\ncurrency with audiences. While scholars working in the field of communication studies\nhave begun to analyze why certain images go viral, explanations readily available from\nargumentation studies generally remain obscured or outside the parameters of those\nexaminations altogether. As a starting point for understanding how argumentation theory\nhelps inform online image circulation, the following will examine four avenues for\ndetecting offending online images that could predictably have a lasting resonance.\n161 2.1 Subjunctive Voice\nOne of the most extensive published studies of recirculation of visual images to\ndate is Zelizer's About to Die: How News Images Move the American Public. Examining\nhistorical American news images that continue to circulate in American media outlets,\nshe borrows the concept of the subjunctive voice from linguistics to explain why such\nimages emerge as resonant over time. She draws a distinction between images that\nmerely document \"what is\" from those which employ \"as if\" or \"what could or should\nbe.\" (2010: 14) She concludes that \"as if\" images (i.e. the ones using the subjunctive\nvoice) have a more lasting influence on culture.\nWhen Zelizer explains why \"as-if\" images have elevated importance, she\nintroduces three characteristic aspects of such images that are well familiar to scholars of\nargumentation studies: contingency, imagination, and emotion. Within the field of\nargumentation studies, Zelizer's notion of contingency, whereby the meaning of images\nchanges over time, is steeped in kairos, the ancient Greek word for right time, arising\ncircumstances, or contingency (Sutton, 2001). Her concept of imagination, where viewers\nfill in the moments before and after the frozen frame, draws from Aristotle's concept of\nthe enthymeme. Finally, her focus on emotional responses, where viewers experience a\nwide and unpredictable variety of expressive reactions based the context of the image,\nconnects explicitly to both classical and contemporary examinations of pathos.\nOne image that illustrates Zelizer\u2019s use of subjunctive voice is the widely\ncirculated photograph of the hooded man standing on a box with electrical cords attached\nto his hands at Abu Ghraib prison. The meaning of the image is contingent, as some\nconsider the photograph to be clear evidence of U.S. torture of Iraqi civilians, while\nothers view it as proof of the U.S.\ncommander\u2019s lack of control at the prison.\nViewers\u2019 imaginations fill in whether the man\nparticipated in acts of terrorism prior to his\nplacement on the box, whether he\nsubsequently endured electrocution, whether\nhe tired to the point of falling from the box, or\nwhether he died. Emotional reactions to the\nimage include horror, glee, satisfaction,\ndiscomfort, or anger (among others)\ndepending on how viewers fill in the events\nbefore and after the frozen frame. The\nphotograph\u2019s evident reliance on subjunctive\nvoice portends that it will continue to circulate\nin the online environment for years to come.\nUS DoD via Wikimedia\nThe \u201cman on box\u201d photographed by US\nsoldiers at Abu Ghraib illustrates 2.2 Argumentative Amplification\nZelizer\u2019s concept of the subjunctive\nvoice (Photograph courtesy of Another way visual arguments potentially\nWikimedia, 2003). extend their longevity through online\ncirculation is through amplification.\n162 Argumentation theorists Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca explain the process of\namplification by noting:\nExcept where argumentation develops within a previously established frame, the\npremises [of an argument] can always be advantageously buttressed by integrating\nthem with other accepted theses. Similarly, unless the point at issue is very\ndefinite, conclusions can be bound up with certain of their consequences, which\nmakes it possible to prolong the argumentation by changing the subject of the\ndiscussion (1969: 474).\nIn the case of visual argument, interactions between the image\u2019s substance and its\ncompositional elements often function as complementary premises that can amplify a\nclaim. In brief, both the form and content of the image work together to bolster the claim\nand its consequences.\nThe widely circulated image of Baghdad resident Ali Abbas snapped at the start\nof the U.S. war on Iraq in 2003 illustrates the point. The photograph shows Ali Abbas, a\n12-year old boy burned and maimed when U.S. bombs hit his Baghdad home on the first\nday of the Iraq War. On a substantive level, the image documents the claim that U.S.\nmilitary attacks harm innocent civilians. The compositional elements of the photograph,\nhowever, reinforce the same conclusion in\nways that other images of civilian casualties\nsnapped during the same war do not. The\npositioning of the photographed body places\nthe child at close, personal distance to the\nviewer with his head in the lower left\nquadrant of the screen, a stance that mimics\nthat of an infant immediately prior to\nbreastfeeding. Ali's bandaged, amputated\narms in the photo render his head\ndisproportionately large in comparison to his\nReuters other body parts, again evoking the image of a\nnewborn. The handle of the Ali's stretcher\nCompositional and substantive resembles that of infant carrier, and the hand\nelements work together in the entering the frame from the top left corner is\nphotograph of Ali Ismail Abbas to suggestive of a mother's hand preparing to\nemphasize the claim that US forces wipe drool from her young child's face.\nharmed the most vulnerable members Together, the compositional elements and\nof Iraqi society (Thomi, 2010). substance of the photo work together to\namplify the claim that U.S. actions harm the\nmost vulnerable members of the Iraqi\nco mmunity.\n2. 2 Argumentative Convergence\nA third factor that contributes to whether offending images are likely to continue\nci rculating in the online environment is convergence. Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca\nex plain why convergence magnifies the argumentative potential of individual claims\n163\nCompositional elements in the photo\nof Ali Ismail Abba emphasize\nargument that US actions harm the\nmost vulnerable members of the Iraqi\ncommunity. when they write, \u201c. . . If several distinct arguments lead to a single conclusion, be it\ngeneral or partial, final or provisional, the value attributed to the conclusion and to each\nseparate argument will be augmented, for the likelihood that several entirely erroneous\narguments would reach the same conclusion is very small\u201d (1969: 471). Within the\ncontext of the visual, convergence can occur when an image combines with other images\nthat bolster the same claim. Previous studies of consumer marketing and political\nadvertising, while not directly on point to the subject of argumentative claims,\nnevertheless document that moderate repetition leads to more audience familiarity, recall,\nand perceived credibility of messages (Cacioppo & Petty, 1979; Fernandez, 2013;\n\u201cRepetition and Truth,\u201d 2012).\nThe Abbas photograph described and shown above contributes to argumentative\nconvergence through its paired association with other offending images that function as\nsimilar data, warrants, and claims within online communication. One such pairing that al-\nQaeda\u2019s production companies presented, for example, involved an iconic image of\nanother 12-year old boy, Mohammed al-Dura, filmed by Talal abu Rahmah for France2.1\nThe frozen frame shows a scared boy crouching behind his father during an Israeli\nDefense Forces-Palestinian gun battle. Later in the videotaped footage, the boy lies across\nhis father's lap allegedly the casualty of Israeli forces according to the story that France2\noriginally produced. While French courts have adjudicated conflicting claims about the\nveracity of the France2 story, the image, nevertheless, has come to symbolize the second\nintifada for much of the public in the Middle East. The quick cut between the Abbas and\nal-Dura images visually invites the inference that collusion exists between the United\nStates and Israel to target Muslim populations, as the actions of both nations\u2019 militaries\nappear to harm young Muslim civilians unable to defend themselves or to fight back in\nany way.\n2.3 Political Identity Markers\nA third group of images re-circulate across time and place in the online\nenvironment are cultural identifiers. Edwards and Winkler (1997) maintain that members\nof the political elite and the rank-and-file citizenry alike widely recognize a small subset\nof images with adaptive, flexible meanings as readily identifiable, political markers of\nculture that embody the propositional logic that defines the boundaries of inclusion.\nHariman and Lucaites agree, maintaining that specific iconic images that avoid rigid\ninterpretation or meaning \u201ccan foster social connectedness, political identity and cultural\ncontinuity\u201d (2007: 111). By transcending particularized meanings embedded in specific\ncontexts, such images do not lose their resilience and ongoing currency. Instead, they\ncome to function as identifying markers of the cultures in which they circulate.\nFive sources of rhetorical power intersect to create political markers of a culture.\nThese include the ability to reproduce ideology, to communicate social knowledge, to\nshape collective memory, to model citizenship, and to become the figural resources for\ncommunicative action (Hariman and Lucaites, 2007). Examples of photographs of\nindividuals that have become positive indicators of collective identity for the American\nculture include Joe Rosenthal\u2019s Iwo Jima photograph, Dorethea Lange\u2019s \u201cMigrant\n1 Cited image of Mohammed al-Dura, available from www.//972mag.com/a-child-is-dead-charles-enderlin-\non-the-al-durrah-incident-10-years-later/3382/ .\n164 Mother,\u201d and Alfred Eisenstaedt\u2019s Time Square \u201cKiss on V-E Day.\u201d Markers of political\nculture, however, can also evoke negative emotions, such as Nick Ut\u2019s \u201cAccidental\nNapalm\u201d photograph from the Vietnam War. Once an image emerges as a political\nmarker demarcating who belongs and who falls outside of the culture, expansions and\ncontractions of the images\u2019 meaning over time reveal shifts in cultural definitions\n(Edwards and Winkler, 1997).\n3. Reconciliation as Visual Response Strategy\nRecognizing that offending images continue to re-circulate in the online\nenvironment, those who have transgressed often choose to offer apologies. Scholars who\nhave examined how national leaders historically craft public speeches in response to\naccusations of offensive words or deeds conclude that such officials generally rely upon\none of two recurrent strategic approaches. The first of these is apologia, which Benoit and\nBrinson define as \u201ca recurring type of discourse designed to restore face, image, or\nreputation after an alleged or suspected wrongdoing\u201d (1994: 75). The second is\nreconciliation, which Hatch defines as \u201ca dialogic rhetorical process of healing between\nthe parties\u201d (2006: 187). For both apologia and reconciliation, public acts of apology\noften function as a key step in the process needed for image restoration or healing\nprocesses.\nThe following sections will explain four key differences between reconciliation\nand apologia, as well as demonstrate how images of reconciliation have comparatively\nsustained currency for online viewers. My use of the term \u201capology\u201d will mean the\ntactical use of actual words and images within specific situations to express regret and\nremorse for prior offending acts without regard for the speakers\u2019 strategic choices. I will\nfollow the lead of Benoit and Brinson to employ the term \u201capologia\u201d as \u201ca recurring type\nof discourse designed to restore face, image, or reputation after an alleged or suspected\nwrongdoing\u201d (1994: 75).\n3.1 Forgiveness vs. Face-Saving\nOne distinguishing feature between apologia and reconciliation involves the\ndesired goal the speaker intends to achieve with the audience. Speakers using apologia\nstrive to restore their own credibility and remove the perception they might be guilty of\ninvolvement in the transgression (McClearey, 1983). Speakers seeking reconciliation are\ninterested in restoring dialogue, instead of pursuing the purposes of shifting blame,\ndenying charges, or some other form of blame avoidance or image repair (Hatch, 2006).\nThe dialogue function of reconciliation affords the injured party an ongoing opportunity\nto either accept or refuse to accept the offered apology, or even to accept, but still\ndemand future apologies in the interests of restorative, rather than punitive, justice.\nThe most frequent visual strategy deployed in images of national apologies\ninvolves a headshot of a designated national leader or other representative apologizing for\ninappropriate words or deeds before a television camera. The approach, frequently\naccompanied by a speaker\u2019s face-saving verbal appeals, rarely results in an image that\nhas lasting circulation in the online environment. An exclusive use of a headshot visually\nremoves the option of reconciliation, as the approach crops out one party in the dialogue.\n165 For example, the January 12, 2012, headshot of\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nspeaking from behind a podium as she\ncondemned video images of Marines pictured\ndesecrating dead members of the Taliban\nillustrates the point. The head-shot positions\nher as speaking to all television viewers\nwithout designating who has the right to accept\nher words or who can demand more from the\nUnited States by way of continued apologies.\nBy contrast, circulating images clipped\nfrom the February 24, 2012, news video of US Department of State\nActing Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter\nA headshot of the individual\nLavoy apologizing for U.S. military members\napologizing visually removes the\nburning Qur\u2019ans provides visual\noption of reconciliation because a\ndocumentation that the U.S. government\nparty to the dialogue is missing.\nsought reconciliation with members of the\nMuslim community.2 The physical site of the (Photograph courtesy of U.S.\nDepartment of State).\napology was the All Dulles Area Muslim\nSociety, one of the largest mosques in the\nUnited States. The location, evident in each frozen frame of the event on the Internet,\ndocuments that aggrieved Muslims are willing to listen to the apology by the U.S.\nmilitary leader. The backs of individual congregation members\u2019 heads, coupled with\nImam Mohamed Magid flanking Assistant Secretary Lavoy and nodding at times during\nhis apology, provide visual evidence that some Muslims wish to continue the dialogue\nwith the United States, rather than reject the appeal outright and pursue more violent\nresponses. Further, Assistant Secretary Lavoy\u2019s public vulnerability, whereby his apology\nmight have elicited a negative reaction from the congregation, the Imam, or both, helps\nelevate the stature of the Muslim members of his dialogue in accordance with the norms\nof reconciliation.\nImages can also function as arguments for reconciliation even when those\napologizing do not speak directly to those aggrieved. On June 15, 2010, for example,\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron apologized before the House of Commons for the\n1972 Bloody Sunday killings, where British authorities killed 14 unarmed protesters who\nhad criticized the British government for detaining suspected IRA terrorists without trial.3\nThe most widely re-circulated image of the event, however, does not occur inside the\nHouse of Commons chamber at the Palace of Westminster itself; instead, it is a still\nimage taken from the video of the families and friends of the dead taped outside the\nchamber. The individuals captured in the screen shot had come to London to publicly\npronounce the innocence of those the British government had killed as they watched the\nspeech. The still image of the audience, cheering in response to Prime Minister\n2\nCited image of Peter Lavoy, available from www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57385035/pentagon-\nofficial-apologizes-for-koran-burning/ .\n3 Cited image of David Cameron, available from www.time.com/time/specials/\npackages/article/0,28804,1997272_1997273_1997274,00.html .\n166 Cameron\u2019s apology, supports the conclusion that the British government was making\nprogress in reconciling with the injured parties for the slain members of their community.\n3.2 Reflection versus Preservation\nBesides having distinctive goals for their audiences, speakers delivering national\napologies have differential goals for themselves based on whether they seek to employ\napologia or reconciliation. Speakers relying on apologia speak in defense of themselves\nto order to change the perceptions of others (Benoit, 1995; Ware and Linkugel, 1973).\nSpeakers attempting to reconcile with aggrieved parties, by contrast, focus on self-\nreflection as a necessary step for preventing the offense from recurring in the future\n(Janseen, 2012). The process of self-reflection, if genuinely and properly implemented,\nhelps restore the dignity of those injured by the previous bad acts. The circulating online\nimages examined here provide evidence that the leaders are engaging in moments of self-\nreflection consistent with the goal of reconciliation. In rare cases moments of self-\nreflection can even serve as the complete argument, shedding any need for an\naccompanying verbal speech of apology.\nThe image most known for demonstrating self-reflection at moments of national\napology involves West German Chancellor Willy Brandt visiting a Jewish war memorial\nin a Warsaw ghetto on December 7, 1970.4 Chancellor Brandt\u2019s state visit to Warsaw was\nan attempt to improve relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, with a planned\nside trip to commemorate the victims of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943. Overcome\nby emotion as he approached the memorial, Brandt fell to his knees in an act of\nrepentance. He offered no words of apology. Later, he would explain that he felt he \u201chad\nto do something to express the particularity of the commemoration at the ghetto\nmonument. On the abyss of German history and carrying the burden of the millions who\nwere murdered, I did what people do when words fail them\u201d (1994: 214). Many academic\nstudies and related press coverage of the incident consider the image of Chancellor\nBrandt\u2019s powerful act of self-reflection on the past wrong acts of Germany as iconic.\n4 Cited image of Willy Brandt, available from https://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/05/25/warschauer-\nkniefall/ .\n167 Brandt\u2019s image, however, is far from alone as a photographed act of self-\nreflection during times of national apology. At times, such images focus on leaders\nsurveying the consequences of their own prior acts, as when Russian President Vladamir\nPutin made a hospital visit to some of the 100 hostage casualties that had resulted from\nhis October 23, 2002 order to gas the Dubrovka Theatre held by Chechen separatists.\nReconciliation images also\ndocument leaders examining the prior\nbad acts of their predecessors, as a\nphotograph of U.S. President George\nW. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush\nduring their visit to Goree Island off\nthe coast of Senegal, illustrates. While\nPresident Bush did not formally\napologize during his trip to the\nprevious center of the West African\nslave trade, he did describe slavery as President of the Russian Federation\none of history\u2019s greatest crimes. The\narchetypal image of the President and Vladimir Putin visits hostage casualties\nFirst Lady moving both literally and following his decision to gas the Dubrovka\nfiguratively through the darkness into Theater (Photograph courtesy of the\nthe light as they walk through the Kremlin, 2002).\nslave quarters makes the visual\nargument that the President engaged in a process of self-reflection.5\nOther re-circulated images of national apology infer that the offender has already\nreflected, recognized wrongdoing, and chosen to take some redemptive action. One\nexample involves the image of the United\nStates flying its embassy flag at half-mast\nin Belgrade, Serbia. The event occurred\nUS Department of State\nThe image of the US flag flying at half-\nPresidencia de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina\nmast in Hong Kong recognizes the\nconsequences of the U.S. error in Argentine Pres. Nestor Kirchner, after a\nbombing the Chinese Embassy process of self-reflection, removed official\n(Photograph courtesy of US Departmentp ortraits of junta military leaders\nof State, 1999). (Photograph courtesy of Wikimedia, 2013).\n5 Cited image can be found at http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030709/w6.jpg\n168 during U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering\u2019s trip to apologize to the Chinese after a B-2\nbomber mistakenly struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7, 1999, killing\nthree Chinese journalists and injuring more than 20 others. A photograph of Argentine\nPresident Nestor Kirchner removing the official portraits of military leaders who, during\nthe junta\u2019s 7-year reign, killed more than 30,000 people considered sympathetic to the\ncommunists\u2019 message, offers another example of redemption sought after many steps of\nthe process of self-reflection.\nImages of self-reflection during\nnational apologies can utilize a wide range of\nrepresentatives to disavow wrongful acts of\nthe past. Most frequently, the photographed\nspokesperson is a head of state or some other\norganizational leader responsible for those\nwho committed the offending act. U.S.\nGeneral John Allen, for example, publicly\napologized in his military fatigues to the\nAfghan President, government, and people for\nthe burning of the Qur\u2019ans that occurred under\nhis personal command of the International\nSecurity Force in Afghanistan. Images of\nUS Department of Defense\ncommunity leaders participating in public\nprocesses of self-reflection can also help General Allen apologized in public\nheighten the call for contemplation to prevent for the burnings of Qur\u2019ans by\nfuture harmful acts. One notable image of soldiers under his command\ncommunity leaders, snapped at the interfaith (Photograph courtesy of US\nvigil in the National Cathedral after the Department of Defense, 2012).\nattacks of September 11, 2001, displayed\nreligious leaders dressed to display many faiths\nsitting together in hopes of moving toward a\nbetter future built on mercy, rather than further\nviolent acts by individuals in the name of\nreligion. Finally, images of self-reflection by\nrank-and-file community members can also\nfacilitate the goals of reconciliation, as when\n250,000 Australians crossed the Sydney Bridge\nto symbolize their denunciation of their nation\u2019s\nprior bad acts against that nation\u2019s aborigines.\nThe image\u2019s inclusion of the word \u201cSORRY,\u201d\nWashington National Cathedral\ndisplayed in skywriting above the bridge,\ncreates an iconic reminder of the outcome of\nDressed to represent their faiths,\nreligious leaders sat together in\nsolidarity during the 9/11 Day of\nPrayer (Photograph courtesy of\nWashington National Cathedral,\n2001).\n169 Australia\u2019s non-aboriginal citizens\u2019 process of self-reflection.6\n3.3 Open vs. Closed Argument\nA third key distinction between apologia and reconciliation deals with the process\nassociated with issuing national apologies. Apologia is an argumentative form that seeks\nclosure or, put another way, completed conflict resolution for past acts of wrongdoing.\nThose who apologize strive to inhibit future discourse about their transgressions and to\nmove on to other matters (Janseen, 2012). Reconciliation, by contrast, is a long-term\nprocess of restoring dignity to the wronged party. Those participating in attempts at\nreconciliation show a continued willingness to\nengage in dialogue that recalls memories of\nthe past and recognizes both the differences\nand differential power between the two parties\ninvolved in the dispute (Janseen, 2012; Hatch,\n2006). A number of online images of national\napology demonstrate that some transgressors\ndo treat the recovery process from their past\nmisdeeds as an ongoing process.\nThe most obvious example was a Courtesy Jorge Pujo\nThe statement written on the lawn of\nphotograph of the grounds outside the\nthe Australian Parliament\nParliament Building of Australia when Prime\nacknowledges that an apology alone\nMinister Kevin Rudd apologized for offenses\nis insufficient for reconciliation\nagainst the aboriginal peoples of Australia.\n(Photograph courtesy of Pujol,\nDuring the nation\u2019s history, the Australian\n2008).\ngovernment\u2019s bad acts included permitting\naboriginal children to be put up for adoption\nto white families in hopes of changing their color through breeding. Prime Minister Rudd\nissued the national apology only after the country\u2019s state parliaments, churches, and\nsocial welfare agencies had first apologized. The image of \u201cSORRY. THE FIRST STEP\u201d\nwritten on the Parliament lawn makes the visual argument that Australia\u2019s apologies were\nonly an initial step in the dialogue, with an open invitation for further steps to help\nremedy the historical offenses against the nation's aborigines.\n6 Cited image to the Sydney Harbor Bridge available from http://theconversation.com/the-case-for-\ngail-jones-sorry-22259.\n170 Another example of an image of\nnational apology that argues for a future,\nopen dialogue is the photograph of U.S.\nPresident Bill Clinton snapped when he\nvisited Ugandan school children at\nKisowera School of Mukono in 1998.\nPresident Clinton did not officially\napologize for slavery at the site but did tell\nthe children that, \u201cEuropean Americans\nreceived the fruits of the slave trade and we\nwere wrong in that\u201d (Bennett, 1998) and\npromised 120 million dollars in educational\nimprovements as a form of reparations.\nThe image places the focus on\nreconciliation for the future, as the\nPresident joins hands with the school\nchildren, Uganda\u2019s future.7 It also recalls Digital Public Library of America\nthe memory of the United States\u2019 history\nAbraham Lincoln\u2019s entry into\nwith slavery by staging a reenactment of\nRichmond at the end of the Civil War\nthe compositional elements of a\nprovides a template for future apologia\nremarkably similar photograph, one that\nimages (Nast, 1866).\ncaptured an image of then President\nAbraham Lincoln, who had hopes for\nfuture reconciliation as he walked through\nthe streets of Richmond at the end of the Civil War.8 Clinton, like Lincoln, towered over\nthe children as he walked hand-in-hand with them; adults flanked both sides of the two\nleaders as they moved forward.\n3.4 Long-term Reunion vs. Short-term Gain\nA final distinction between apologia and reconciliation relates to the desired\noutcomes from the transgressor\u2019s response. Apologia focuses on short-term gains\nachievable by regaining favor with audiences already predisposed to the speaker\u2019s\narguments (Towner, 2010). Reconciliation, by contrast, has a goal of understanding the\nlong-term processes of image restoration and mutual respect between the aggrieved and\nthe transgressor. Attempts at credible reconciliation utilize symbols of reunion to\ndemonstrate that the aggrieved has genuinely granted the forgiveness sought by the\noffender (Hatch, 2006). Visual images freeze the moment of genuine forgiveness and,\nwhen replayed in the online environment, carry forward the steps of reunification into\nperpetuity.\nThe most common symbol of reunion following a national apology is the\nhandshake, denoting respect between the two parties. Accompanying facial expressions,\nsuch as smiles and direct eye contact, contribute to the handshake image\u2019s ability to argue\nthat sincere forgiveness has occurred. At times, the demographic characteristics of the\n7 Cited image of William Clinton available http://media.nola.com/politics/photo/10607176-large.jpg.\n171 participants shaking hands become reinforcing evidence for the authenticity of the\nreconciliation attempt. After former South African President William De Klerk\napologized for 4 decades of rule by his nation\u2019s white supremacist government, for\nexample, the stark contrast between the skin tones of President De Klerk and Bishop\nDesmond Tutu, then acting in his role as Secretary General of the South African Council\nof Churches, makes a visual argument for the reunion of the races, the goal strived for\nduring the proceedings of South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commissions.9\nBesides the handshake, the use of\nphysical space in images associated with\nnational apologies can argue for genuine\nreunion between the transgressor and the\naggrieved. Consider the widely circulated\nimage of President Clinton and Mr. Herman\nShaw, one of the few remaining survivors of\nthe Tuskegee Syphilis study. The\nphotographers snapped the picture after\nClinton apologized to the survivors, family\nmembers, children, and grandchildren of\nthose the U.S. government had told were\nWhite House TV receiving treatment for syphilis, but instead\ndenied them treatment after failing to obtain\nEven though Tuskegee study survivor\ntheir consent to participate in the study. The\nHerman Shaw is not looking directly at\nClinton-Shaw image records such a close\nPres. Clinton, the close distance between\npersonal distance between the two men that,\nthe two shows that the nation\u2019s apology\neven though Mr. Shaw does not look\nwas accepted (Photograph courtesy of\ndirectly at President Clinton, his acceptance\nWhite House, 1997).\nof the apology appears genuine.\n9 Cited image of Bishop Tutu and William De Klerk, available from www.time.com/time/\nspecials/packages/article/0,28804,1997272_1997273_1997279,00.html.\n172 Other compositional elements of photographs can also contribute to the\nperception of a genuine, successful reconciliation. An image of a meeting between\nPresident Barack Obama, Vice President Joseph Biden, Harvard Professor Henry Gates,\nand Sergeant Joseph Crowley illustrates a number of other visual strategies available to\nsignal that genuine reconciliation has occurred. Prior to the meeting President Obama had\nannounced that Sergeant Crowley \u201cacted stupidly\u201d when he arrested Gates during his\nresponse to a call about an alleged burglary attempt at Gates\u2019 home. Physical presence\nand setting, seating arrangements, props, and dress that the photographer captured in the\nimage all invite the audience to infer that the previous conflict between the men was in\nthe past. The image documents that each of\nthe men agreed to be present at the informal\nmeeting on the White House lawn. The\nalternating seating of the black and white\nparticipants visually responds to the\nunderlying charge of racism that magnified\nthe arrest into a national news story. The\nbeers and the willingness of the nation\u2019s\ntwo top leaders to remove their suit jackets\nreinforce the conclusion that the men share\nPete Souza for the White House Photo Office\nan informal camaraderie. Together, the\nimage functions as visual evidence that the Compositional elements \u2013 physical\nmen have moved past the incident and presence, setting, seating\nforgiven each other for the arrangements, propos, and costume -\nmisunderstanding. can indicate that genuine\nreconciliation has been achieved\n(Photograph courtesy of White House,\n4. Conclusion 2009).\nWhile studies of the verbal\ndiscourse of apologia yield important insights into how speakers can restore their\npreviously damaged reputations with the public across a myriad of contexts,\ncomplementary studies of visual argument provide a much needed corrective for a public\nthat has a growing reliance on internet sources for information. This study has revealed\nthat the field of argumentation studies has much to contribute to interdisciplinary\nconversations currently underway about what Internet content goes viral and accordingly,\nwhat offending images should prompt a response that incorporates visual argument. The\nresilient presence of content on the Internet creates a situational exigency where visual\nargument strategies consistent with reconciliation, rather than apologia, produce a more\nlasting, and arguable more effective, response from the transgressor.\n173 References\nAbdullah, R.
