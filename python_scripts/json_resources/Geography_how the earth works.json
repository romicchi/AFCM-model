{"text":"HOW THE EARTH WORKS\nA Simplified View of Our Complex Planet\nDarren Leaver\nAsst. Prof. of Geography\nGlendale Community College, CA HOW THE EARTH WORKS: A Simplified View of Our Complex Planet\nThe discipline of Geography is often defined as \u201cthe study of Earth as the home of mankind.\u201d In\nessence, this places Geography in a unique setting, a sort of \u201cbridge\u201d between the Physical Sciences (the\nstudy of Earth\u2019s physical attributes and processes) and the Social Sciences (the study of Earth\u2019s human\nactivities such as cultures, politics, history, economics, etc.). With that said, the field of Geography is\nitself divided into two main areas; Human Geography and Physical Geography. As the name implies,\nHuman Geography has a focus on the planet\u2019s human activities, and how these activities interact and\ninfluence (or are influenced by) the planet\u2019s bio-physical environment. As with related disciplines\nwithin the Social Sciences, Geographers explore, describe, analyze and assess various human activities\n(religion, culture, agriculture, language, politics, economics, poverty, disease) but what sets the\nGeographer apart is the focus on mapping these phenomena and assessing the nature of the distributions.\nFor instance, where an Economist might focus on the fiscal mechanisms of poverty in a specific region\n(let\u2019s say Haiti), a Geographer might specialize in the global distribution of poverty, analyzing the\ncommon root causes within poor areas, then looking for potential pathways out of poverty. The\nmapping of poverty can often bring some striking surprises, with some areas of the USA showing\nextreme poverty compared to some regions of India which (to many people\u2019s surprise) can be\nconsiderably more wealthy. Human Geography is so vast in scope it is divided into sub-fields such as\nCultural Geography, Economic Geography, Political Geography, Historical Geography and Human\nImpact on the Environment, to name just a few.\nPhysical Geography has a focus on the Earth\u2019s natural bio-physical environment, including the\natmosphere, water bodies, rocks, plants and animals. Physical Geographers explore and describe Earth\u2019s\nbio-physical properties, look for and map recognizable patterns in the distribution of Earth\u2019s physical\nphenomena (climate, storms, earthquakes, etc.), analyze and try to explain the complex interactions\nbetween these phenomena, and assess the two-way impacts between Earth\u2019s physical phenomena and\nEarth\u2019s human inhabitants.\nAs a Physical Geography text, this book will focus on the Earth\u2019s physical properties, and attempts to\ncommunicate complex concepts in a style which can be understood by \u201ceveryday folk\u201d, those with\nlimited exposure to the scientific jargon of the day. The goal is to allow for a general understanding of\nthe main processes which shape the distribution of our planet\u2019s natural landscapes, weather, climate,\nplant and animal distributions, and geologic processes. The approach is to dismantle some of our\nprevious notions about the Earth, and then use new information to rebuild these concepts at a college-\nlevel understanding. For example, I often begin my college lectures by posing the following conundrum\nto my students:\nWe all know that the Earth orbits around the sun once each 365.25 days, or once every Earth year. Our\npath is that of an ellipse (egg shape), with an average distance between the Earth and the Sun of about\n93,000,000 miles. However, this is the average distance, and since the orbit is elliptical we get as close\nto the sun as 91,500,000 miles and as far from the sun as 94,500,000 miles. One of these Earth-Sun\npositions occurs on approximately July 4 of each year, with the other occurring around January 3. So,\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 which date represents our closest distance from the Sun, July 4 or January 3? Since my students are\nbased in California in the Northern Hemisphere (with hot July temperatures\u2026and little in the way of\nGeography or Earth Science education in the pre-college years) the overwhelming response is that we\nmust be closest to the Sun around July 4 of each year. This makes perfect sense, but is completely\nwrong. In fact, July 4 marks the Earth\u2019s aphelion, the furthest distance between the Earth and Sun\nduring the Earth\u2019s annual orbit around the Sun. July 4 may bring hot weather to California, but at the\nsame time Australia, South Africa, and Argentina are experiencing typical winter weather, and they are\nlocated the same distance from the Sun as California is. Clearly, distance from the Sun is not the\nprimary reason for places on Earth having different temperatures on the same day! We\u2019ll explore the\ntrue reasons a little later.\nIt is important to reiterate that the main goal of this book is for a general understanding of how the Earth\nworks, not a complete understanding, since many of the concepts we will explore are far more complex\nthan explained herein. A more thorough description would require much longer chapters, and in some\ncases would require so much detail that you\u2019d probably fall asleep before achieving our main goal.\nThe danger in the general understanding approach of this book is that we end up with a general\nunderstanding of how the Earth works at the expense of a more thorough analysis. However, take\ncomfort in knowing that a general understanding of how our planet works will take you a long way in\nmaking sense of your own earthly observations. For those willing to delve deeper into each subject we\nexplore, I will provide numerous web links along the way which allows for further exploration of the\nsubject material of each chapter.\nLastly, take comfort in knowing that even professional scientists don\u2019t have all the answers for many\naspects of the planet\u2019s physical mechanisms. Over time, dedicated scientists uncover many answers to\nthe complexities of the Earth\u2019s inner workings, but there\u2019s still a long way to go. In the end, it is my\nhope that you will enjoy learning about \u201chow the Earth works\u201d and better appreciate the unique place we\nall call \u201chome\u201d. Hopefully you will be the one to uncover some of Earth\u2019s secrets in the near future!\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO PLANET EARTH\nLearning Objectives:\nUpon successful completion of this chapter the student should be able to demonstrate critical\nthinking skills and a basic understanding of:\n1. The 4 Geographic Spheres and the interactions that occur between them;\n2. The age of the earth and its location in space;\n3. The size, shape and orientation of earth relative to its orbit around the sun;\n4. Earth-moon interactions and moon phases;\n5. The causative factors for earth\u2019s seasons and key points within earth\u2019s yearly revolution;\n6. The differences between earth\u2019s revolution and rotation, and how these earth motions manifest\nthemselves in our daily lives;\n7. The portrayal of earth using maps, globes and the geographic grid;\n8. The division of earth into standard time zones.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 EARTH: FOUR GEOGRAPHIC SPHERES\nThe study of Physical Geography is made more manageable if we divide the subject matter into four\nmain parts that we call Geographic Spheres or Environmental Spheres. We can then study each\nGeographic Sphere individually but we can also explore the connections between these spheres. These\nspheres are so important that our book is laid out into sections based upon each of them.\n1. Atmosphere (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atmosphere_of_Earth)\nThe atmosphere is defined as the gaseous envelope\nsurrounding the Earth, which we sometimes call\n\u2018air.\u2019 As we will see later, air is a mixture of gases\n(Nitrogen, Oxygen, Argon, Water Vapor, Carbon\nDioxide, etc.) along with smattering of liquids\n(liquid water) and solids (dust, soot, pollen, ice,\netc.). The first half of this book will focus on the\natmosphere as we explore its composition, the\nvarious layers of the atmosphere, high pressure, low\npressure, winds, storms, and what constitutes\nweather versus climate.\n2. Hydrosphere (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hydrosphere)\nThe second section of the book focuses on the\nhydrosphere. This sphere is all about water, which\ncan be found in the three forms of liquid (liquid\nwater or just plain water), solid (ice), or gas (water\nvapor). We\u2019ll explore where the various forms of\nwater can be found on the Earth. For instance, of\nEarth\u2019s available water over 97% can be found in\nthe oceans. We\u2019ll look at how this water got there,\nwhy it sits in the oceans, and how the water cycles\nbetween the oceans, atmosphere, mountain glaciers,\nstreams, lakes, rivers, and (hopefully) back to the oceans.\n3. Biosphere (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Biosphere)\nIn the third section of the book we study Earth\u2019s life forms. While this\nalso includes viruses, bacteria, single-celled organisms, fungi, and\noceanic life-forms, we will focus on land-based (terrestrial) plants and\nanimals. We\u2019ll map out the locations of Earth\u2019s major large ecosystems\n(known as Biomes) and detail the plant and animal communities of these\nbiomes. We\u2019ll learn the difference between a woodland and a forest,\nand try to make sense of why Tropical Rainforests and Tundra exist\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 where they do and explain the impact of weather and climate on their locations, as well as how\nplate tectonics and ocean barriers might have influenced the distribution of the plants and\nanimals.\n4. Lithosphere (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lithosphere) a.k.a. Geosphere\nThe last section of the book (and it\u2019s a\nlarge one) deals with the Earth\u2019s\nLithosphere. This sphere includes Earth\u2019s\nrocks, soil, and sediment. Studying the\nLithosphere allows us to better understand\nthe inner workings of our planet and how\nthe internal layers influence the Earth\u2019s\nsurface in terms of volcanoes,\nearthquakes, mineral resources, and the\nmovement of entire continents.\nTake a look at the following video for a more dynamic look at the Geographic Spheres and their\ninteractions with each other. http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BnpF0ndXk-8\nFood for Thought\nOnce you\u2019ve viewed the video, try to draw a simple diagram showing the fours spheres and how they\ninteract with each other. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to place an object into a specific Geographic Sphere.\nFor instance, to which Geographic Sphere would you assign a raindrop as it falls? How about a small\ngrain of pollen blowing in the wind? Would a tiny grain of clay that has just blown from a desert and\nlanded in the ocean be considered part of the lithosphere, the hydrosphere or both? Can you think of a\nunique example where one Geographic Sphere influences a different sphere? Lastly, can you think of\nways in which human activities are influencing these Geographic Spheres?\nHOW OLD IS EARTH, WHERE IS EARTH LOCATED IN SPACE, AND WHY IS THIS\nIMPORTANT?\nIn order to study the Earth we first have to know a little about how old it is, where our planet sits in the\nsolar system and how it is positioned in space, how large our planet is, how it moves around its axis and\naround the sun, and how the Earth interacts with the sun to create our seasons.\nScientific evidence indicates that Earth and our entire solar system formed from a cloud of interstellar\ngas and dust about 4.6 billion years ago. The process of planetary formation was completed as dust, gas\nand larger solid blocks gathered or \u2018accreted\u2019 together over a very short time (relatively short, that is) of\nabout 10-20 million years. As very hot, radioactive materials were accreted to this early earth, the entire\nmass of rock material melted. Over time the outer layers cooled and solidified into our crust and formed\ntoxic atmospheres that would eventually escape our planet\u2019s gravity. With continued cooling and\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 bombardment from icy meteors our oceans and a stable water-bearing atmosphere began to form. For a\ngood visual representation of earth\u2019s formation click on the following link and watch the following\nvideo https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x1QTc5YeO6w\nOur Solar System\nOur Solar System (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Solar_System) consists of the Sun and both the planets and smaller\nobjects orbiting it. The four inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars), are referred to as the\nterrestrial planets and are primarily composed of rock. Earth is located approx. 93 million miles from\nthe sun on average but can be as close as 91.5 million miles (perihelion) and as far as 94.5 million miles\n(aphelion) as we make our yearly orbit around the sun. The four outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus\nand Neptune) are much larger than the terrestrial planets and are composed mainly of gases and ices.\nThese four are often referred to as giant planets or Jovian planets.\nThe area between Mars and Jupiter is occupied by an asteroid belt of rocky, metallic Earth-like\nmaterials. Beyond the orbit of Neptune are numerous dwarf planets including Pluto, Ceres and Eris.\nThese objects are large enough to be rounded by their own gravity but are not large enough to be\nspherical, and are therefore not considered \u2018true\u2019 planets. They also have orbits that don\u2019t align with the\ncelestial plane of the main planets of our solar system.\nIn another 5 billion years the core of our Sun will have expended all of its hydrogen fuel, and it will\nbegin to contract. This will generate heat, which in turn will allow hydrogen in the outer layers of the\nsun to fuse together into Helium, releasing loads of energy and expanding the size of the sun\u2026to the\npoint the Earth will likely get swallowed up. So, Mother Earth is 4.6 billion years old and has no more\nthan another 5 billion years remaining. Anyone worried?\nThe Moon\nThe Earth has one large, natural satellite which we call the moon. The moon has a diameter of\napproximately 2,200 miles (about a quarter of that of Earth) and is located approximately 238,000 miles\nfrom the Earth. The moon orbits the Earth in a west-to-east direction once every 29.5 days, which\nmeans we get a one full moon most every month. It is possible to get two full moons in a single 30-day\nor 31-day month (let\u2019s say on the 1st and 30th of a month). The second full moon in a single calendar\nmonth as a Monthly Blue Moon, a rare phenomenon occurring once every 2.7 years. Note that there\nwill be two Monthly Blue Moons in 2018, one in January and the other in March.\nAlthough the moon revolves around the Earth in a west-to-east direction, it appears to move in an east-\nto-west direction as it rises in the east and sets in the west. The main reason for this apparent motion is\nthat the Earth rotates from west-to-east at a much faster pace (once every 24 hours). The net effect is\nthat while the Earth rotates once every 24 hours, the moon is also orbiting toward the east, so it takes\nanother 50 minutes for the Earth to \u2018catch up\u2019 to the exact position in the sky where the moon was seen\non the previous day. Thus, the moon rises and sets 50 minutes later each and every day. Check out the\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 following link for a good description of the moons phases.\nhttp:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/46\/Moon_phases_en.jpg\/800px-Moon_phases_en.jpg\nThe following diagram shows the various moon phases courtesy of the US Naval Observatory\nhttp:\/\/aa.usno.navy.mil\/faq\/docs\/moon_phases.php\nMOON PHASES\nNew Moon - The Moon's non-illuminated side is facing the Earth. The Moon is not visible (except during a solar eclipse).\nWaxing Crescent - The Moon appears to be partly but less than one-half illuminated by direct sunlight.

Have you ever thought about how big Earth is or\nwhat shape it is? Is it flat? If you look at the floor you\u2019re standing on you might think so! Is Earth\nround? Is it a sphere? A quick look at a globe seems to indicate yes. Is it big? Having flown around\nthe Earth several times it certainly seems very big, taking hours and hours to fly around just small parts\nof the planet. Take a look at a globe and put your fingers on London and Los Angeles. This is a very\nsmall portion of the globe yet it takes 10 or more hours to fly this distance at speeds over 500mph! The\nplanet is big, but let\u2019s see just how so. Check out this great link for a discussion of the size of the Earth\ncompared to the sun.\nA spherical object can be measured in terms of Circumference (the distance around one of the fat parts\nor great circles), Diameter (the distance from one outer edge through the center and out to the opposing\nouter edge), and Radius (the distance from the inner center to the outer edge, which happens to be\nexactly half the diameter). To the nearest 1,000 miles, Earth\u2019s critical measurements are:\nRadius = 4,000 miles\nDiameter = 8,000 miles\nCircumference = 25,000 miles\nIf we were to measure Earth\u2019s diameter along any great circle (one that runs through a \u2018fat\u2019 portion of\nthe Earth, cutting it into two equal halves), it is always 8,000 miles when we round off to the nearest\n1,000 miles. However, we get a different story if we measure more precisely, let\u2019s say to the nearest one\nmile. In this case, Earth\u2019s diameter is different along almost every great circle, with a difference of 27\nmiles between the diameter measured across the Equator (equatorial diameter) and the diameter\nmeasured from the North Pole to the South Pole (polar diameter) as shown below:\nEquatorial Diameter = 7,927 miles.\nPolar Diameter = 7,900 miles.\nThis difference of 27 miles is known as Equatorial Bulge (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Equatorial_bulge).\nSo why is the Earth fat around its mid-section? Well, the Earth spins or \u2018rotates\u2019 once every 24 hours on\nan axis running from North Pole to South Pole. As the Earth rotates from west to east on this axis, the\nPoles just seem to spin around without moving significantly, while the equator rotates almost 25,000\nmiles in 24 hours (look at a globe as you spin it and see that the equator moves the furthest in each spin).\n25,000 miles in 24 hours is about 1,040 miles per hour! Since Earth\u2019s internal layers are not all solid,\nand since the equator feels the effect of this spinning more than any other part of the planet, the equator\nexperiences an outward force called centrifugal force (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Centrifugal_force) which tends to\nbulge it outwards away from the Earth\u2019s axis of rotation.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 Because of this Equatorial Bulge, Earth\u2019s polar axis is slightly shorter than its equatorial axis, so Earth\u2019s\nshape cannot be considered a true sphere. Instead, Earth\u2019s shape is described as an Oblate Spheroid\n(http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oblate_spheroid), like a slightly squashed almost-sphere. In fact, Earth is only 0.34%\nfrom being a perfect sphere, even if you count the little bumps and divots on the surface (what we would\ncall mountains and ocean basins).\nSo how does this Oblate Spheroid called Earth sit in relation to the sun? Well, the path the Earth takes\naround the sun is referred to as the Earth\u2019s Plane of the Ecliptic. A line drawn at an angle of 90 degrees\nfrom this plane is referred to as the Perpendicular to the Plane of the Ecliptic, or just \u2018Perpendicular\u2019.\nEarth\u2019s north-south polar axis, the axis we rotate around every day, is inclined 23.44 degrees (let\u2019s just\nsay 23.5 degrees) from the Plane of the Ecliptic.\nThis 23.5 degree Axial Tilt is also known as Earth\u2019s Angle of Inclination or Polarity since the Earth\u2019s\ntilt dictates that the North Pole points towards the North Star, which is named Polaris.\nEarth Motions and Seasons\nSo there you have it, we travel around the sun in one year and the whole time we have a 23.5 degree tilt\nwhich directs our North Pole constantly towards the same point in space (towards Polaris). With the\nNorth Pole pointing towards the same distant star every day, the northern hemisphere points somewhat\ntowards our own star (the sun) for half of our yearly orbit, and somewhat away from the sun for the\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 other half of our orbit. In essence, it is these changes, caused by our axial tilt and our yearly revolution\n(orbit) around the sun that give us seasons on Earth. Let\u2019s explain this in more detail by clarifying\nEarth\u2019s important motions and introducing the concepts of equinoxes and solstices.\nIf you viewed Earth for a long enough period of time from a vantage point way out in deep space, you\u2019d\nnotice that our planet moves in several different ways. First of all, our entire Solar System moves\naround our galaxy (the Milky Way) once every 225-250 million years. This very long time period\nmeans that we might, at times, move into areas of thicker cosmic dust while at other times we might be\nin areas free of this celestial debris. The impact to our climate might be significant for millions of years,\nbut this will NOT create significant changes to our climate or weather during our lifetimes. Therefore,\nwe don\u2019t consider this to be a significant Earth motion for this course. The same is true of other Earth\nmotions that are collectively referred to as Milankovitch Cycles\n(http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Earth_wobble) and operate on time periods of 21,000 to over 400,000\nyears. These will be discussed in greater detail when we explore long-term climate change.\nThe Earth motions which do affect us regularly are those of Rotation (Earth spinning on its own axis\nevery 24 hours) and Revolution (Earth orbiting the sun once every 365.25 days +\/-). Revolution, the\nEarth orbiting the sun, takes approximately 365.25 days to complete. Our 21st-Century working\ncalendars have 365 days per year, with the extra 0.25 day saved and added up to give us a Leap Year\nmost (but not every) four years (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Earth_year). As mentioned before, it is our\nrevolution around the sun in combination with our fixed axial tilt which gives us our seasons by pointing\nthe northern and southern hemispheres somewhat towards or away from the sun at opposite times of the\nyear. When looking from deep space, our revolution looks like this:\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 Notice that on the far left side (June) the Northern Hemisphere is pointing somewhat towards the sun,\nwith the North Pole basking in sunlight for a full 24 hours per day as Earth spins on its axis. During the\nmonth of June, the light from the sun won\u2019t even make it to the South Pole, giving that region 24 hours\nof darkness each day. This effect is maximized each year on or around June 21, when the sun\u2019s rays are\ndirected towards the Northern Hemisphere more so than any other day of the year, with the direct\n(vertical) ray of the sun striking 23.5 degrees north of the equator. In the Northern Hemisphere this\nrepresents the first day of summer, while for the Southern Hemisphere this represents the first day of\nwinter. On this date, the further north you go on the planet, the more daylight hours you\u2019ll receive. This\nexplains the presence of a \u201cMidnight Sun\u201d (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Midnight_sun) in far northern\nlatitudes like parts of Scandinavia, Siberia, Canada or Alaska during the month of June. We once\nreferred to this date as the Summer Solstice, but it\u2019s best to call it either the \u201cNorthern Hemisphere\nSummer Solstice\u201d or the June Solstice to be fair to both hemispheres.\nOn the right side of the diagram is the representation of the December Solstice (approx. Dec. 21\/22)\nwhen the direct ray of the sun strikes 23.5 degrees south of the equator. This represents the first day of\nwinter for the Northern Hemisphere and the first day of summer for the Southern Hemisphere. On this\ndate the South Pole and the entire Antarctic Circle (located at Latitude 66.5\u02daS) will receive 24 hours of\ndaylight, while the North Pole and the Arctic Circle (located at Latitude 66.5\u02daN) will receive 24 hours\nof darkness. In essence, on this date the further south you travel the more daylight hours you\u2019ll receive.\nThe two remaining positions on the diagram represent the September Equinox (lower left) and March\nEquinox (upper right), which occur when the sun\u2019s direct ray strikes the equator on or around\nSeptember 22 and March 20, respectively. On these dates everywhere on the planet receives equal\namounts (12 hours) of daylight and night. The name Equinox is derived from the Latin words for equal\n(equi) and night (nox).\nCheck out these links for animated descriptions of why we have seasons.\nhttp:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/seasons-aren-t-dictated-by-closeness-to-\nsun?playlist=Cosmology+and+Astronomy\nhttp:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/how-Earth-s-tilt-causes-seasons?playlist=Cosmology+and+Astronomy\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O9hawBb3wbk\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=taHTA7S_JGk\nAphelion and Perihelion\nIn addition to the equinoxes and solstices there are two additional dates of importance as the Earth orbits\nthe sun (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Apsides). These are:\nJULY 4: Aphelion, when the Earth is at a maximum distance of 94.5 million miles from the sun.\nJAN. 3: Perihelion, when the Earth is at a minimum distance of 91.5 million miles from the sun.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 Check out this link for the annual dates of Perihelion and Aphelion\nhttps:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/astronomy\/perihelion-aphelion-solstice.html\nThe diagram (above) exaggerates the elliptical nature of Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun, but this allows you\nto visualize Perihelion and Aphelion a little better. Because of this elliptical orbit, the sun is closer to\nthe southern hemisphere during their summer months, so the southern hemisphere receives\napproximately 7% more solar energy than the northern hemisphere during the respective summer\nmonths. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the southern hemisphere gets warmer summers than the northern\nhemisphere (despite what Australian farmers might say) but it does mean you have to be very careful\nabout getting too much sun exposure during an Argentine or Australian summer since the sun\u2019s harmful\nrays are generally stronger there than in the northern hemisphere. We\u2019ll look at the effects of this\nincreased energy on the weather and climate of the southern hemisphere in later chapters.\nRotation\nWe\u2019ve already established that Earth\u2019s seasons are caused by the combined effects of axial tilt and\nrevolution. We\u2019ll now focus on the second important Earth motion, that of Rotation (Earth spinning on\nits own axis once every 24 hours), which is responsible for both ocean tides and the need for\nestablishing standardized time zones.\nEarth rotates from west-to-east once every 24 hours on an axis running from the North Pole to the South\nPole. Since only 50% of a spherical body (and hence, an Oblate Spheroid) can be illuminated by the\nsun, with the other 50% remaining in shadow, rotation allows us to have daylight and nighttime hours,\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 with daylight occurring when our particular portion of the planet is pointing towards the sun, and\nnighttime when we are in the shadow side. This also means that while some places on Earth are\nexperiencing the sun at its highest position in the sky for that day, at the exact same moment other places\nare immersed in the darkness of night. With this in mind, and since the Earth rotates a full 360\u00ba once\nevery 24 hours (15\u00ba every hour) we have established 24 whole-hour time zones across the planet, with\nthe centers of each time zone being 15\u00ba (of rotation) apart from one another (more on this to come).\nA second major impact of rotation is the generation of ocean tides. Tides are the periodic rise and fall\nof the ocean\u2019s surface due to the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. As the Earth rotates from\nwest to east, these celestial bodies pull the Earth and its ocean waters towards them, lifting the ocean\nwaters as a high tide. With continued rotation, the high tide gradually subsides, yielding a low tide\nseveral hours later. As rotation progresses, the tide will build again into the next high tide. Most places\non Earth receive two high tides and two low tides every 24 hours and 50 minutes (a lunar day), while\nothers receive only one high and one low tide each day.\nImage: http:\/\/oceanservice.noaa.gov\/education\/kits\/tides\/tides03_gravity.html\nSince the gravitational pull of the sun and moon have a cumulative effect, tides are most extreme (high\nand low) twice every month when the sun, moon and Earth are found in a straight line. These extreme\ntides are called spring tides and occur around the time of full moon and new moon. The least extreme\ntidal fluctuations are found when the Earth, sun and moon are oriented in such a way that they create a\nright angle, in what are termed neap tides. These occur approximately 7.5 days before and after a new\nmoon or full moon. Check out these links for visual representations of spring and neap tides as well as a\nsolar day versus a lunar day:\nhttp:\/\/oceanservice.noaa.gov\/education\/kits\/tides\/media\/supp_tide06a.html\nhttp:\/\/oceanservice.noaa.gov\/education\/tutorial_tides\/media\/supp_tide05.html\nMAPS AND GLOBES\nRepresentations of the Earth are shown on globes (scaled 3-dimensional models of the Earth) and maps\n(flat, scaled, 2-dimensional representations of the whole Earth or portions of it). Since the Earth is a 3-\ndimensional object, it is quite easy to transfer data onto a 3-dimensional globe, although we can never\nshow great detail on such a small model of the Earth. However, since maps are largely 2-dimensional, a\nprocess called map projection is required to transfer 3-dimensional data onto a 2-dimensional map, but\nthere are inherent distortions in accomplishing this. The main distortions are those of size (Mercator\nMap Projections show Mexico to be quite small and Alaska grossly enlarged) or shape (Norway can\noften appear to be much longer in some projections). Projections such as the Robinson Projection have\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 attempted to minimize these distortions, but they can never be eliminated from a 2-dimensional map.\nFor this reason, the only true representation of our 3-dimensional planet is a 3-dimensional globe. Fully\nappreciating the complexities of map projection requires a hands-on, experiential learning environment\nlike a Geography Lab, and your school probably offers the lab course which compliments this lecture\ncourse. If you just can\u2019t wait, more detailed information on map projections can be found by clicking on\nthe following links at https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8I_VpC6IuJs and\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bBMs_LpwYpU .\nTHE GRID SYSTEM of LATITUDE and LONGITUDE\nIn order to locate ourselves on this revolving, rotating oblate spheroid that we call Earth, we often use\ngeographic place names and addresses. However, there are many places on the planet which don\u2019t have\nspecific addresses or place names (a portion of the Amazon rainforest, or a portion of the Pacific Ocean)\nbut we still need to have a precise method for identifying these locations. Luckily, such a system of\nglobal location exists in the form of the Geographic Grid of \u201cLatitude and Longitude\u201d.\nCheck out these YouTube links for the Geographic Grid and Latitude\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?annotation_id=annotation_591747489&feature=iv&src_vid=lUMlmRzkuuY&v=pAZUrlKk6CE\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ALN7gXF1thY\nLatitude (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latitude) is a measure in Degrees, Minutes and Seconds\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Degree_(angle) of how far a place is located north or south of the Equator.\nLines of Latitude run in an east-west direction, but again, they have north and south measure. The\nmaximum measure for latitude is 90\u00baN (N. Pole) and 90\u00baS (S. Pole). In addition to the Equator and the\npoles, other key lines of latitude include the Arctic Circle (66.5\u00baN), Tropic of Cancer (23.5\u00baN), Tropic\nof Capricorn (23.5\u00baS), and the Antarctic Circle (66.5\u00baS). Though the North and South Poles can be\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 thought of as geometric points, the remaining lines of latitude can be viewed as either circles or lines,\ndepending on the frame of reference. The only line of latitude which cuts the Earth into two equal half\n(what we call a Great Circle) is the Equator.\nLongitude (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Longitude) is a measure in Degrees, Minutes and Seconds of\nhow far a place is located east or west of an agreed-upon starting point, the Prime Meridian, the\nlongitude line which runs through Greenwich, London, England (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prime_Meridian).\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 Lines of Longitude run in a direct line from the North Pole to the South Pole, but again, they have east\nand west measure. The maximum measure for longitude is 180\u00ba, which is both east and west of the\nPrime Meridian, and thus does not require an E or W with its measurement (nor does the Prime\nMeridian, since it is neither E nor W of itself). The 180\u00ba Meridian is often called the International\nDateline, though in reality they are not one and the same, as the International Dateline crosses the 180\u00ba\nMeridian at several locations due to the presence of political boundaries.\nAll other places on the planet do require an E or W after its Longitude designation so that we clearly see\nwhich way to go from the Prime Meridian to find the place in question. For example, a place located at\n34\u00ba09\u201941\u201dN, and 118\u00ba10\u201903\u201dW tells us this place is located a specific arc distance north of the Equator\nand west of the Prime Meridian, a location that GoogleEarth shows to be at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena,\nCalifornia.\nAll lines of Longitude are called Meridians, and they are all portions of Great Circles, cutting the Earth\ninto two equal halves. Meridians are widest (furthest apart) at the Equator, and they all meet at a single\npoint at the North Pole, as they do at the South Pole. For this reason, the location of the North Pole\nwould be shown as just 90\u00baN, with no need for a longitude designation (in effect, the North Pole\u2019s\nlongitude is all longitudes, since all lines of longitude converge there).\nTIME ZONES\nSince the Earth completes a full west-to-east rotation every 24 hours (it spins a full 360\u00b0) it rotates\nexactly 15\u00b0 every hour. This means that if a city experienced the sun at its zenith (high point) in the sky\nat noon, any place on the planet located 15\u00b0 to the west of the city would experience the zenith sun\nexactly one hour later (and that would be noon for them). In essence, every 15\u00b0 line of longitude (called\nPrincipal Meridians) marks the center of 24 main time zones which stretch around the globe starting at\nthe Prime Meridian. Again, these 15\u00b0 increments mark the center of time zones, so the edges of these\nmain time zones are located 7.5\u00b0 to both the east and west of the Principal Meridians.\nSo if you move from west to east across the planet you will inevitably cross the boundaries between\nneighboring time zones. For instance, if you travel from Los Angeles (time zone based on the 120\u02daW\nPrincipal Meridian) to New York (75\u02daW) you will cross three time zone boundaries. Since you traveled\neast you would have to advance your watch three hours forward. It could be that you flew directly to\nNew York, leaving Los Angeles at 2pm and arriving in New York just five hours later at 10pm New\nYork time! In essence, traveling towards the east means that you lose an hour of your life for each time\nzone you cross into!\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 Map of US Time Zones from NationalAtlas.gov\nHowever, the old saying \u201cGo West Young Man\u201d can be applied to your return journey, as you gain\nhours back by traveling towards the west. For each time zone you cross in this direction, you gain an\nextra hour of your life by turning your watch back an hour each time you cross a time one boundary. By\nflying direct to Los Angeles from New York your plane might take off at 2pm New York time, arriving\nfive hours later at 4pm Los Angeles time.\nSo you might think \u2018what if I just kept going west, could I get progressively younger?\u2019 Well, the answer\nis yes\u2026and no. It is true that as you travel west you reset you watch back one hour for each time zone\nboundary you cross, but this only works until you get to 180 degree meridian, which is (or more\nprecisely, should be) the location of the International Dateline. At this critical line of longitude you\nhave to pay back 24 one-hour time resets all at one. So as you travel across the International Dateline by\ntraveling west, you lose an entire 24-hour day all at once as you move from the \u201cWestern Hemisphere\u201d\ninto the Eastern Hemisphere\u201d. The west side of the Dateline might be Wednesday at 10:45am while on\nthe east side it would be Thursday at 10:45am, a full 24 hours difference!\nIn 2012 I took an 18-hour flight from Los Angeles to Bangkok,\nThailand. I departed LAX at 9:00pm on Thursday January 27, and\narrived in Bangkok 18 hours later at 6:00am on Sunday January\n29th. This 18-hour flight had me arriving 33 hours later!\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 My return flight took me from Singapore to Tokyo, Japan and\nfinally back to Los Angeles. I departed Tokyo at 5:30pm on\nTuesday February 7, 2012 and arrived a little less than 9 hours\nlater at LAX to find that it was 10:15am on Tuesday February 7.\nThough the flight lasted almost 9 hours I arrived before I left!\nCheck out these YouTube links for Time Zones\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kDWHM00sZJc&feature=related\nQuite often time zone boundaries create a little trouble because part of a country or state might be split\ninconveniently by a time zone boundary (in your city it could be that your house would be located\nwithin one time zone while your workplace just a few miles away is located in another time zone). For\nthis reason time zones often wrap around political boundaries so that we avoid unnecessary problems.\nThe Pacific island nation of Samoa found itself in \u2018Time Zone Trouble\u2019 because it sat on one side of the\nInternational Dateline while most of the island\u2019s tourists came from nearby countries (Australia, New\nZealand) located on the other side of the Dateline. This meant that a tourist leaving New Zealand on\nSaturday would arrive into Samoa about 3 hours later, only to find that is was now Friday! On their\njourney home they might leave Samoa on Sunday morning, and after a short flight they would arrive in\nAuckland, New Zealand on Monday afternoon and be quite late for work! Samoa experienced so much\ndifficulty with its time zone they actually changed on New Year\u2019s Day 2012 so that they are now on the\nsame side of the International Dateline as Australia and New Zealand. However, their closest neighbor,\nAmerican Samoa, remains on the other side of the Dateline, so as one problem was fixed another was\ncreated. Check out the following link describing the situation in Samoa.\nhttp:\/\/www.npr.org\/2011\/05\/09\/136149457\/samoa-changes-time-zones\nFood for Thought: Where on earth are Principal Meridians located furthest from one another?

Furthermore, many countries and states, especially in the Northern Hemisphere mid-\nlatitudes, adopt Daylight Savings Time during their summer months by temporarily advancing time by\none hour starting in spring and then back again in the fall. The practice allows for more afternoon and\nevening sunlight at the expense of morning sunlight during the summer, with proponents arguing that it\nbenefits retail and restaurant sales after traditional summer work hours.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright Darren Leaver 2018 Here\u2019s a map of World Time Zones as compiled by the United States Naval Observatory.\nDST used\nDST no longer used\nDST never used\nWith all the variables to consider figuring out the time in a foreign city can get quite complicated.

Factors Influencing Weather and Climate\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver The Atmosphere\nPhoto Courtesy of NASA (http:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/multimedia\/imagegallery\/image_feature_519.html)\nOur atmosphere is an envelope of air surrounding the planet, but we rarely take the time\nto think about exactly what this \u201cair\u201d stuff is composed of, how the tiny components of\nair can have a huge impact on our climate, or that there are various layers to our\natmosphere, each one behaving differently from the other layers. We\u2019ve all had\nconversations about how our climate seems different lately, or that our weather is\ngetting \u2018weirder\u2019 by the year, but do we really understand the main difference between\nweather and climate? Can we explain to others the main factors which collectively yield\ndifferent climate types for two distant places on the planet? Can we explain how New\nYork was under miles of ice only a few thousand years ago? All of this can be explained\nif we know a little more about our atmosphere, so let\u2019s dig deeper into this together!\nOur atmosphere is defined as an envelope of gases, liquids and small solid particles\nsurrounding the earth. The liquids are mostly water droplets found in clouds, and the\nsolid particulate matter is mostly tiny specs of dust, ash, pollen, ice, and salt temporarily\ncaught in wafting air currents. The vast majority of the atmosphere consists of a mixture\nof gases; three main gases and numerous trace gases. If we were to take a sample of air\nfrom numerous places on the planet\u2019s surface and extract the small solid particles, any\nliquid drops, and all the water vapor in the air sample, we\u2019d be left with what atmospheric\nscientists call \u201cdry air\u201d. Now, upon analyzing this dry air we find it remarkable that the\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver samples all seem to have about the same concentrations of three main gases, as shown in\nthe diagram below:\n1) Nitrogen (N ), 78 %\n2\n2) Oxygen (O ), 21%\n2\n3) Argon (Ar), 0.93%\nFor actual concentrations click\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Air#Composition\nNitrogen\nAtmospheric Nitrogen in the lower atmosphere is found mostly in the form of N at a\n2\nconcentration of 78% of dry air, making it the earth\u2019s largest reservoir of Nitrogen.\nNitrogen is continuously recycled as it falls to earth trapped within rain drops and soaks\ninto layers of soil. It is then absorbed by bacteria in the soil, assimilated into the roots of\nplants, and then released back into the atmosphere, thereby keeping the atmospheric\nNitrogen concentration very stable over time.\nThe N form means two Nitrogen atoms have bonded together to form a single molecule.\n2\nThis bond is extremely strong, taking an enormous effort to break apart. This makes N\n2\nquite ineffective at mixing with other molecules in the atmosphere or for that matter, with\noxygen in our lungs. We breathe in air rich in N and we breathe out air rich in N , as our\n2 2\nbodies cannot take in the atmospheric Nitrogen in this form.\nThis is not to say that Nitrogen is not important. On the contrary, it is essential for life on\nEarth as it is a main ingredient in the formation of amino acids, proteins, DNA, RNA and\nneurotransmitters. Humans indeed require Nitrogen, but we don\u2019t get it from the\natmosphere. Instead, we rely on bacteria in the soil or certain specialized plants which\nbreak down the N bonds and allow the free Nitrogen atoms to create complex\n2\ncompounds like nitrates. These compounds are then absorbed by the roots of plants, and\nwhen we consume the plants we in turn absorb the Nitrogen necessary to form our own\namino acids, proteins, RNA and DNA. For more on the formation and recycling of\nNitrogen compounds click on this link http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nitrogen_cycle.\nWhen asked \u201cwhat is the main gas in the atmosphere\u201d most people would answer\n\u201cOxygen\u201d, but they would be quite wrong. Notice that the main atmospheric gas is\nactually Nitrogen, which is present at a concentration almost 4 times that of Oxygen.\nAt sea level N is quite harmless, but this isn\u2019t always the case. If you were to go scuba\n2\ndiving you\u2019d be breathing from a tank of compressed air, 78% of which is N . As a diver\n2\ndescends to a depth of about 66 feet, the air is compressed so much that the molecules\nnow take up only a third of the volume they did at sea level. Taking a breath at this depth\nwould fill the lungs with 3 times the number of (compressed) molecules as compared to\nsea level, so not only is the tank depleted of air 3 times faster, the tiny N molecules are\n2\nabsorbed by the blood stream more effectively. The Nitrogen mixes with oxygen in the\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver blood to form Nitrous Oxide, a.k.a. laughing gas. Nothing you want to deal with when\nyou\u2019re 66 feet below sea level.\nOxygen\nOxygen in the lower atmosphere is found at a concentration of 21% of dry air, in the form\nof O which is referred to as \u2018molecular Oxygen\u2019. This molecule\u2019s source is almost\n2\nentirely from photosynthesizing plants and algae, which has been ongoing for about 3.5\nbillion years. Our earlier atmosphere would have been devoid of O prior to the presence\n2,\nof our planet\u2019s earliest blue-green algae. O is critical for humans, as we inhale air rich in\n2\nO which we use for respiration, and we exhale air rich in carbon dioxide (CO\n2 2).\nArgon\nArgon (Ar) is Earth\u2019s third most-common atmospheric gas, with an atmospheric\nconcentration of 0.93% of dry air. Almost all of this Argon originates from the\nradioactive decay of Potassium in the Earth\u2019s crust. Argon doesn\u2019t readily mix or\ncombine with any other gases, so we breathe it in and breathe it out without taking it up\ninto our bodies, and this gas is not responsible for any climate change issues of note.\nIf we add up the concentrations of N O and Ar we can see that these three gases alone\n2, 2,\nmake up 99.93 % of dry air, leaving only 0.07% of the atmosphere\u2019s volume for all other\ngases (plus small particulate solids and water). So what\u2019s the big fuss over global\nwarming gases like carbon dioxide or acidic compounds like sulfur oxides if they\nrepresent such a small quantity of the atmosphere? Well, the answer is that very small\nconcentrations of these remaining gases can have a BIG effect on the atmosphere. We\ncall these remaining atmospheric molecules the variable gases because their\nconcentrations vary from place-to-place and from time-to-time. They also go by the\nname of trace gases because they have very small concentrations (there\u2019s only a small\ntrace of them in the atmosphere). Let\u2019s take a look at them.\nThe Variable Gases\n(It will help you understand these better if you make a chart of the following details).\n1. Water Vapor (H 0). Two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.\n2\nConcentration: Between 0% and 4%\nAir with close to 0% water vapor can be found in deserts and at the poles (the Atacama\nDesert and McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are the driest places on earth).\nAir containing 4% water vapor is found near the equator including the tropical rain\nforests and above the tropical oceans.\nSource: Evaporation from oceans, seas, lakes, and any other object containing water. It\nis estimated that the average water vapor molecule stays in the atmosphere for 10 days.\nProblem: None, it\u2019s natural. However, water vapor is the dominant atmospheric gas\nresponsible for the natural Greenhouse Effect. In this process, Water Vapor (along with\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Oxides of Nitrogen, Ozone and other gases) allows the sun\u2019s\nshort-wavelength radiation to pass through the atmosphere where the radiation is then\nabsorbed by earth\u2019s surface, which then heats up. The heated surface of the earth then\nsends long-wavelength heat energy back towards outer space, but these atmospheric\ngases (including water vapor) temporarily trap this outgoing heat energy.\nImage: http:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/paleo\/globalwarming\/images\/greenhouse_effect-v1.jpg\nFor analogy, think of a hot asphalt parking lot which has been in the summer sunshine all\nday. Long after the sun has gone down you can feel the heat rising up from the asphalt.\nThis heat would quickly rise through and out of the atmosphere if it wasn\u2019t for water\nvapor (and other gases) which temporarily trap this heat in the lower atmosphere so we\ndon\u2019t quickly freeze once the sun goes down.\nSo, water vapor in the lower atmosphere makes the air warmer than what it would be\notherwise. In this way, water vapor acts just like panes of glass in a greenhouse, which\nallow the sun\u2019s rays to pass through the glass to heat up the interior of the glass building.\nThe glass then tends to trap the warm air within the greenhouse. For this reason, water\nvapor (along with carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides, ozone) is considered to be a\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG), one which contributes to the Greenhouse Effect.\nScientists are concerned about Climate Change (more on this later), the warming of\nEarth\u2019s surface due to the addition of gases to our atmospheric gases with associated\nimpacts to earth\u2019s geographic spheres. Though atmospheric water vapor is not\nconsidered to be a direct contributor to Climate Change, this gas does tend to amplify the\neffects of those gases which do contribute to the unusual warming pattern we are\ncurrently experiencing. Additionally, a warmer lower atmosphere tends to promote\nhigher rates of evaporation which can temporarily (and locally) increase the water vapor\nconcentration of air, which can lead to localized increases in rainfall (but who knows\nexactly where?) and less snowfall in California\u2019s mountains. In Southern California we\nneed more winter snow which, upon slowly melting, feeds our rivers and recharges our\ngroundwater basins well into the summer months.\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver 2. Carbon Dioxide (CO\n2)\nConcentration: 410 ppm (parts per million) in\n2018 and rising 2ppm per year.\nSource: Multiple sources including burning\nanything that\u2019s carbon-based (fossil fuels,\nwood, coal, cigarettes, etc), volcanoes, and\ndeforestation\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere\nProblem: As previously mentioned, CO is a Greenhouse Gas, one with an ability to\n2\ntemporarily trap energy in the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide has many natural\nsources, including volcanic eruptions, brush fires, forest fires, and respiration. Between\n120,000 and 20,000 years ago, the atmospheric concentration of CO saw a pattern of\n2\nslow decline as we entered an ice age. This was followed by a rather steady increase\n(with fluctuations) in atmospheric CO as the climate began to warm rather quickly over\n2\nthe past 18,000 years. Throughout this entire 120,000 year time span, and most likely for\nthe past 650,000 years, global CO concentrations appear to have remained within a range\n2\nof 180 to 300 parts per million (ppm).\nSince human populations were quite small and technologies quite primitive, early human\nactivities could not have contributed significantly to the increase of atmospheric CO\n2\nuntil we began to clear land for villages and agriculture some 11,000 years ago. Even so,\nthis early contribution to changes in the atmosphere\u2019s composition would have been very\nsmall indeed. As the climate continued to emerge from the last ice age, there was a\nsimultaneous increase in human population coupled with advances in technology which\nallowed for a greater ability to clear forests. Evidence suggests that by 4,000 years ago\nancient Greek forests were already in peril, and as human population continued to\nincrease more forests were cleared and atmospheric concentration of CO inched higher.\n2\nBy the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th Century, the CO concentration\n2\nstood at approximately 280 parts per million, a number we often use to represent the pre-\nindustrial level of atmospheric CO Though there was certainly a human element to at\n2.\nleast some of this pre-industrial atmospheric CO , the contribution is considered to be\n2\nquite small and only a trace of it can be attributed to the burning of fossil fuels (i.e. coal,\noil, natural gas). The burning of fossil fuels began in earnest towards the end of the 18th\nCentury as coal seams became the power source of the Industrial Revolution in Europe\nand then North America. These fossil fuels had been created through a long process\nbeginning with ancient photosynthesizing plants, algae, and bacteria pulling carbon\ndioxide out of our early atmosphere. These ancient organisms used the carbon to create\ncarbohydrates, sugars and proteins (in essence they built themselves) and they released\noxygen back to the atmosphere. In certain instances, the carbon-based cells of the plants,\nalgae or bacteria were buried in low-lying, watery areas such as swamps or shallow seas.\nIf the organic matter was buried deeper and deeper before being decomposed, the added\npressure and heat over millions of years would convert it into coal, oil or natural gas. In\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver essence, the carbon pulled out of the atmosphere by photosynthesizing organisms was\nnow locked away in the form of a fossil fuel, buried deep below the earth\u2019s surface.\nIn time, and in a very cyclic manner, our atmosphere became progressively richer in\noxygen while being depleted in carbon dioxide so that by the time humans began to have\na significant impact to the environment the atmospheric CO concentrations had been\n2\nreduced to less than 200 parts per million (ppm). Once fossil fuels were selected as a\nmajor fuels source for industrial activity, this trend would be reversed. Burning of fossil\nfuels released CO back into the atmosphere, containing the carbon that was extracted by\n2\nthe ancient photosynthesizing plants, algae, and bacteria. The addition of this \u2018old\u2019\ncarbon would be the main driving force of Climate Change.\nThe image shown below is a graph of CO concentrations measured from Antarctic ice\n2\ncores with an associated temperature trend (superimposed in red) compared to the\naverage Antarctic temperature for the period 1850 to 2000 AD. It is very clear that a\ncorrelation exists between atmospheric temperature and CO concentration.\n2\nSource: http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/climatechange\/science\/pastcc.html#last\nThe main reasons for this increase are the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.\nOver the past 200 years our global industries have been fueled largely on the fossil fuels\ncoal, oil, and natural gas. The burning of these carbon-based fuels sends CO into the\n2\natmosphere, while deforestation means that trees that would have once \u201cvacuumed\u201d the\natmosphere of CO are no longer around to do so. The rates of both fossil fuel\n2\nconsumption and deforestation have increased along with human populations and our\ndesire for food, cars, and housing. This has been especially true since the 1950s, when\nmany developing countries began to seek the lifestyle of richer, western countries. This\ntrend continues into the 21st Century, even as many \u2018rich\u2019 countries appear to be second-\nguessing their own thirst for natural resources. On May 9, 2013 the daily average CO\n2\nconcentration measured at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii reached 400ppm for the\nfirst time since measurement began in 1958. The current average atmospheric\nconcentration of CO is close to 410ppm, and it\u2019s increasing in a seasonal zig-zag pattern\n2\nat 2ppm every year. It is likely this concentration of CO has not been seen in the\n2\natmosphere for at least 3 million years! Furthermore, it is estimated that the residence\ntime of CO in the atmosphere is approximately 100 years, so CO is here with us for\n2 2\nquite some time!\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Source (NOAA): https:\/\/www.esrl.noaa.gov\/gmd\/ccgg\/trends\/full.html\nThe additional atmospheric CO from deforestation and burning of fossil fuels makes\n2\nCO the primary gas responsible for what we variously call the Enhanced Greenhouse\n2\nEffect, Global Warming, Anthropogenic Climate Change, Climate Change, Global\nClimate Change, Climate Weirding and a handful of other names (opponents of this\nscience have some very colorful terms for it). The term Global Warming is less popular\nin the scientific community since it refers largely to the warming of the lower atmosphere\nand ocean surface (but does infer the related changes to earth systems). The scientific\ncommunity prefers the term Climate Change, which addresses the entirety of changes to\nEarth\u2019s geographic spheres due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\nWe refer to all the gases responsible for Climate Change as Greenhouse Gases (GHGs).\nThe main reason for this is that for the most part, these gases are responsible for both the\nGreenhouse Effect and for Climate Change. Admittedly, this creates a bit of confusion,\nbecause water vapor is a Greenhouse Gas but does not appear to contribute greatly to\nClimate Change.\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Courtesy of NOAA: https:\/\/www.esrl.noaa.gov\/gmd\/ccgg\/trends\/\nConfusion aside, the term Climate Change is a good choice for describing the process\nbecause while most places on the planet are getting warmer, some places are\nexperiencing slightly colder temperatures. Some places are getting wetter, while other\nplaces are drying out. Many places are experiencing overall warmer average\ntemperatures but are getting extremely cold winter spells which are still being offset by\nlong summer heat waves. Basically, weather and climate are becoming more extreme\nand unpredictable, impacting to the hydrosphere, biosphere and society.\nThe excess CO in the atmosphere appears to be the main cause of the unusual increase in\n2\nthe Earth\u2019s surface temperature over the past 200 years. The current high concentrations\nof CO correspond with the warmest average global temperatures since modern records\n2\nwere first kept starting in the 1880s. Though there are many methods and datasets for\nmeasuring the earth\u2019s temperature, the most highly regarded are those of NASA and\nNOAA. These sources both show that the 11 warmest global temperatures recorded in\nmodern times were all since 1998, with 2016 being warmest. NOAA shows 2017 as the\nthird warmest year on record, while NASA shows 2017 as the second warmest (see this\nvideo link). The following chart shows the top 10 warmest years in modern times\ncourtesy of ClimateCentral.org\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Source: http:\/\/www.climatecentral.org\/gallery\/graphics\/the-10-hottest-global-years-on-record\nThis short NASA Video shows how different our recent climate is from that of just 120\nyears ago, and the graph (below) shows that we are heating up faster than ever before.\nhttp:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/topics\/earth\/features\/2010-warmest-year.html\nOriginal Image: http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/GlobalWarming\/page2.php\nThe surface of the planet is warming up, and there\u2019s no stopping any time soon. The\ngreat majority of the heat released into the atmosphere has been absorbed by the oceans,\nwhich have heated up and stored much of the excess carbon dioxide. Estimates are that\nabout 94% of the excess heat attributed to Climate Change has been taken up by the\noceans compared to about 6% for the atmosphere, land surfaces and glaciers combined.\nThis means that even if we were to burn much less fossil fuels, resulting in a significant\nreduction in CO emissions into the atmosphere, we\u2019d still be dealing with elevated CO\n2 2\nconcentrations and Global Warming for the next several hundred years because the\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver oceans would steadily release their stored heat and CO back to the atmosphere. To\n2\nvisualize this, think of a hot tub on a cold winter night. Since the hot water stores so\nmuch heat energy, it continues to provide heat to the overlying air for many hours after\nthe heat has been turned off. In this way, the oceans will continue to supply both heat\nand CO for not just hours, but probably for the next thousand years.\n2\nAs the chart indicates\nto the right indicates,\ncarbon dioxide is\nestimated to be\nresponsible for 63%\nof the atmospheric\nwarming attributed to\nhuman activities,\nmaking CO2 the\ndominant\nAnthropogenic\nGreenhouse Gas.\nBesides the general warming of the lower atmosphere, some of the effects of Climate\nChange that we are already experiencing, and will continue to experience for the\nforeseeable future include:\no Melting glaciers\no Rising sea level\no Increased intensity of tropical storms\no Loss of farmland\no More extreme seasonal weather patterns\nThe atmospheric warming from Climate Change leads to the excessive melting of ice\ncaps located in Antarctica, Greenland and in high mountain ranges such as the Andes.\nThis melting, along with the associated warming of the oceans, is causing sea level to rise\nfaster than what would be considered natural. The Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) estimates that sea level will rise between 0.6 and 2 feet by the\nend of the 21st century, with low lying areas such as Florida\u2019s coastlines experiencing\nincreased coastal flooding and more intense hurricane activity.\nThe IPCC predicts that in general, the Polar regions will receive more precipitation while\ntropical regions will receive less rainfall. It is projected that the southwest USA and\nmany parts of Australia will experience periods of excessive drought and more intense\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver heat waves. The average weather conditions for these regions might not seem far\nfrom normal conditions, but it\u2019s the extreme summer weather which worries climate\nscientists. Additional predictions include excessive pressure on fragile ecosystems and\non food production. This has enormous consequences for society as we are dependent on\nthese crops as our main food supply.\nTo illustrate the economic concerns related to Climate Change, take a look at this graph\nshowing the distribution of just some of the record $306 billion in damages attributed to\nextreme weather patterns across the USA.\nSource: http:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/news\/2017-was-3rd-warmest-year-on-record-for-us\nFor California, scientists are very concerned about the prospect of years of prolonged\ndrought followed by the occasional excessively wet winter (with severe flooding).\nAgain, the average rainfall may change slightly, but the real worry is the extreme years of\ndrought and flood.\nFor example, the extreme dry conditions in California throughout the summer and Fall of\n2017 provided ideal conditions for the many wildfires throughout the state, resulting in\nsevere loss of forests, homes and lives. Though the 2017-18 Southern California winter\nhas been one of the driest on record, it only took one intense downpour to bring a river of\nmud and boulders cascading down the recently-burned hills above Santa Barbara and into\nresidential neighborhoods of Montecito, completely burying houses and highways. As\nClimate Change progresses unchecked, we can expect more events like these.\nAnother of our main concerns in California is the potential loss of snowpack in our major\nmountain chains. Not only does this affect our ability to go snowboarding, but if Climate\nChange results in higher winter rainfall at the expense of winter snowfall, our water\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver resources will be stretched thin over the summer and fall months. This will be\ncomplicated by changes in the distribution of rainfall. Our water resource plans have\nbeen designed based upon where available water can be trapped in dams and then\nallocated to places in need of water. We are already seeing that as rainfall patterns\nchange our reservoirs are drying up, and in time there may not be enough water to meet\nthe needs of agriculture, industry, cities and towns. The State of California, as well as\nmany of our cities and counties, has to plan accordingly and quickly.\nThe predicted effects of Climate Change can be viewed at\nhttp:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/GlobalWarming\/page6.php\nFor a further exploration of Climate Change, check out this NASA website:\nhttp:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/GlobalWarming\/\nand this YouTube link http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=USIAcXfv39k&feature=related\nFor another local perspective, a recent study of temperature data for two key locations in\nthe greater Los Angeles area from 1906 to 2006 (http:\/\/climate.nasa.gov\/files\/LAHeatWaves-\nJournalArticle.pdf) shows that the average annual maximum temperature increased 5.0\u00b0F\nover the past century. The analysis also revealed that long heat waves were virtually non-\nexistent prior to 1956 but are now commonplace in the midst of a Los Angeles summer.\nThe study also found that the average minimum temperature increased by 4.2\u02daF over the\npast century. This creates a major concern for the future if we are to expect more of\nSouthern California\u2019s mountain precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow, which we\ndepend upon to feed our streams, rivers and reservoirs in late spring, summer and even\nfall. Climate Change is here!\nSo I ask you, what can be done to stop Climate Change?\nCan anything be done to minimize the effects of Climate Change?\nWould these steps cost you money and create health problems, or otherwise?\n3. Methane (CH\n4)\nConcentration: Trace (small amount, just less than 2ppm)\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Methane#Atmospheric_methane\nSource: Methane is produced by microbes in the final phase of the decay of organic\nmaterial in oxygen-poor environments such as swamps and rice paddies. Microbes and\nbacteria present in the guts of termites and cattle can also produce vast quantities of\nmethane. Methane is the primary constituent of natural gas, the earth\u2019s most abundant\ncombustible material. Excess methane is released into the atmosphere through oil\ndrilling activities, coal mining, conversion of land to rice paddies, and conversion of land\nfor cattle grazing.\nProblem: Methane is the second most important Greenhouse Gas. It is estimates to be\nresponsible for 18.5% of the warming associated with Climate Change, and has a\nresidence time of 12 years in the atmosphere. It may sound odd at first, but we can\nreduce the atmospheric impact of this gas by reducing our intake of beef. This is because\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver much of the world\u2019s beef is now raised in tropical regions where rainforest is cleared to\nmake way for pasture. By reducing our consumption of beef we reduce the demand for\ncattle and by doing so we reduce the demand for tropical pasture. Less rainforest is\ndestroyed and there are fewer herds of cattle releasing methane. It\u2019s win-win, not to\nmention the health benefits!\n4. Oxides of Sulfur (SOx)\nConcentration: Trace (less than 1ppm)\nSource: Swamps, oil drilling, burning of coal\nProblem: Acid Rain\nAcid Precipitation:\nCO + H O = Carbonic acid (H CO )\n2 2 2 3\nSOx + H O = Sulfuric acid (H SO )\n2 2 4\nSulfur is found as an impurity in most fuels, but especially in coal. When we burn coal\nwe release not only CO but also Sulfur Oxides. Downwind, these gases mix with\n2\natmospheric water to create clouds with a high concentration of Carbonic Acid and\nSulfuric Acid. These clouds then precipitate highly acidic moisture onto forests, cities\nand lakes with nasty consequences.\nFor example, natural lake water should be blue-green or red-brown in color as a\nreflection of the algae and plants living in the lake ecosystem. As acidic rain falls on the\nlake it is like adding acid to a green swimming pool. With enough acidity all the green\nlife forms are killed, along with the entire ecosystem. Again, this typically happens\ndownwind of large industrial cities. This happened in places like Sweden and Finland\n(downwind of industrial W. Europe) and Canada (downwind of US industry in\nMichigan). However, \u201cwe all live downwind,\u201d which means since we are living on an\noblate spheroid, everything comes back around.\n5. Oxides of Nitrogen (N O, NO and NO , commonly written as NOx)\n2 2\nConcentration: Trace (about 0.3ppm)\nSource: There are numerous natural forms of Nitrogen Oxides, but the atmospheric\nconcentration has increased due to agriculture and the burning of fuels at very high\ntemperatures, like those in car engines or coal-burning power plants. These gases\nbecome part of a system where the nitrogen is cycled through the atmosphere, soil,\nvegetation and animals, but the excess NOx appears to remain in the atmosphere for over\n100 years.\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Problem: NOx molecules are Greenhouse Gases and also contribute to acid rain.\n6. Ozone (O )\n3\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ozone#Ozone_in_Earth.27s_atmosphere\nhttp:\/\/www.ozonelayer.noaa.gov\/science\/basics.htm\nConcentration: Trace (less than 0.1ppm)\nSource: There are two types of Ozone: Stratospheric and Tropospheric\nStratospheric Ozone (natural, good)\nThis layer of ozone is located about 8 to 30 miles above our heads, providing natural\nprotection from the sun\u2019s harmful ultraviolet rays. Stratospheric ozone forms when high-\nenergy ultraviolet radiation from the sun splits an O molecule into two separate oxygen\n2\natoms. The oxygen atoms then recombine with a nearby O molecule to form a molecule\n2\ncomprised of three oxygen atoms. We call this molecule ozone or O , and it has the\n3\nimportant function of absorbing most of the sun\u2019s high-energy ultraviolet radiation that\nreaches earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nWith a reduction in this natural sunscreen layer, we would be exposed to increased\nultraviolet rays from the sun, resulting in more frequent cases of sunburn, eye cataracts,\nand even skin cancer. Stratospheric ozone accounts for 90% of the earth\u2019s entire ozone\nsupply.\nThis same high-energy ultraviolet radiation can strip an Oxygen atom away from an O\n3\nmolecule, yielding O and O but these will recombine given enough time. The battle\n2,\nbetween the Ozone formation process and the Ozone depleting process has been waging\nfor the past 3.5 billion years, but over time our important stratospheric \u2018ozone layer\u2019 was\ncreated. Unfortunately, we\u2019ll soon see it has been under threat since the 1940s.\nTropospheric Ozone (derived from smog, bad)\nThis layer of ozone is formed at the earth\u2019s surface as a component of smog, in and\ndown-wind of cities. Tropospheric ozone forms as a reaction of sunlight on air\ncontaining the fumes from burned fuels. It irritates eyes, throats, and respiratory tracts. It\nis so toxic that it\u2019s often used to kill bacteria in sewage. Tropospheric ozone is also a\nvery effective Greenhouse Gas.\nProblem: Ozone is both toxic and a Greenhouse Gas. The residence time of tropospheric\nozone is quite short, usually a few days or less.\n7. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chlorofluorocarbon and http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/ozone\/science\/sc_fact.html\nConcentration: Trace\nSource: Refrigerants, fumigants, propellants, solvents.\nProblem: Ozone Depletion and a Greenhouse Gas\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are human-made compounds containing carbon, fluorine\nand chlorine atoms. They are related to another important group of human-produced\nhalocarbons called halons, which contain carbon, bromine, fluorine, and chlorine. CFCs\nand halons are used as aerosol propellants, circuit board solvents, fumigants, and most\ncommonly as refrigerants (such as Freon).\nImage: http:\/\/www.ozonelayer.noaa.gov\/science\/StratO3.jpeg\nWhen released, CFCs drift into the upper atmosphere where they are subjected to very\ncold temperatures and sunlight, which breaks these compounds down, releasing free\nChlorine atoms. Once free to roam, the Chlorine atoms find and break apart multiple\nozone molecules, thereby weakening our protective Stratospheric Ozone Layer.\nThis leads to more of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays making their way through the atmosphere\nand damaging our skin. This is especially so over the Antarctic, where the ozone layer\nhas been weakened so much it\u2019s referred to as an ozone hole.\nThe severity of ozone depletion over the Antarctic was first recognized in the late 1970s\nand has been monitored closely since then. Both land-based and satellite observations are\nmade every Antarctic spring (September through November) when the sun emits\nultraviolet radiation into the bitterly cold Antarctic stratosphere for the first time in six\nmonths, readily breaking CFC molecules apart, releasing free chlorine atoms to do their\ndamage. The following diagram shows the progressive depletion of Antarctic ozone\nfrom 1980 to1991 (the purple color represents less total ozone).\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Image: Antarctic Ozone 1980 to 1991 http:\/\/www.atm.ch.cam.ac.uk\/tour\/part2.html\nThe international community came together to pass the Montreal Protocol in 1987,\nwhich phased out the production of ozone-destroying compounds such as CFCs.\nAlthough this was an environmental success, the CFCs already emitted can reside in the\natmosphere for over a century.\nIn addition, some CFCs are still being used along with\nother ozone-depleting compounds, albeit in much\nsmaller quantities than before. The result is that\nstratospheric ozone is still being destroyed, but at the\nsame time we see more and more stratospheric ozone\nreforming. The greatest total Antarctic ozone loss to\ndate occurred in September 2006 as shown in the\nNASA image to the right. The 2006 Antarctic ozone\nhole covered 29.5 million square kilometers with a\nvery low ozone concentration measured as 82 Dobson\nUnits, where normal concentrations would be about\n300 Dobson Units.\nEven this \u201cnormal\u201d amount of ozone is quite small, as this entire quantity of ozone would\nbe no thicker than two pennies if it was under the same atmospheric pressure as at sea\nlevel. Since 2006 the size of the Antarctic ozone hole has gotten smaller (better) but in a\nzig-zag pattern. The September 2012 hole reached a maximum size of 21.1 million\nsquare km with a minimum ozone concentration of 124 Dobson Units, the best scenario\nin over 20 years. However, the news for the 2013 through 2016 Antarctic ozone holes\nwas not quite so good, with 2015 reaching a maximum size of 28.2 million square km\nand a minimum ozone concentration of just 101 Dobson Units. Lastly, we saw a vast\nimprovement in 2017, with the Antarctic ozone hole reaching just 19.6 million square km\nin area, with a minimum ozone concentration of 131 Dobson Units\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Ozone Hole Area Minimum Ozone\n(million km2) (DU)\nMaximum Daily Minimum Daily\nYear Date Value Date Value\n1979 17 September 1.1 17 September 194.0\n1980 21 September 3.3 16 October 192.0\n1981 10 October 3.1 10 October 195.0\n1982 02 October 10.8 02 November 170.0\n1983 17 October 12.2 06 October 154.0\n1984 24 September14.7 03 October 144.0\n1985 03 October 18.8 24 October 124.0\n1986 06 October 14.4 06 October 140.0\n1987 29 September22.5 05 October 109.0\n1988 20 September13.8 30 September 162.0\n1989 03 October 21.7 07 October 108.0\n1990 19 September21.1 05 October 111.0\n1991 04 October 22.6 06 October 94.0\n1992 27 September24.9 11 October 105.0\n1993 19 September25.8 25 September 104.0\n1994 30 September25.2 30 September 73.0\n1996 07 September26.9 05 October 103.0\n1997 27 September25.1 24 September 99.0\n1998 19 September27.9 06 October 86.0\n1999 15 September25.8 29 September 97.0\n2000 09 September29.9 29 September 89.0\n2001 17 September26.5 22 September 91.0\n2002 19 September21.9 20 September 131.0\n2003 24 September28.4 26 September 91.0\n2004 22 September22.8 04 October 102.0\n2005 11 September27.2 30 September 103.0\n2006 24 September29.6 08 October 84.0\n2007 13 September25.2 24 September 108.0\n2008 12 September27.0 04 October 101.0\n2009 17 September24.4 26 September 97.0\n2010 25 September22.6 01 October 119.0\n2011 12 September26.1 08 October 95.0\n2012 22 September21.1 01 October 124.0\n2013 16 September24.0 29 September 116.0\n2014 11 September24.1 30 September 114.0\n2015 02 October 28.2 04 October 101.0\n2016 28 September23.0 01 October 114.0\n2017 11 September19.6 09, 12 October 131.0\nCourtesy of NASA: https:\/\/ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov\/statistics\/annual_data.html\nWith a reduction in CFC use is the ozone hole repairing itself and have we seen the worst\nalready? Only time will tell. Here\u2019s a good animation of Antarctic ozone from 1979-\n2017 (the dark blue colors show thin ozone levels). Please check out this link for the\ncurrent status of the Antarctic ozone hole at http:\/\/ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov\/.\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Lastly, CFCs have also been shown to be effective Greenhouse Gases, with each\nmolecule being thousands of times more potent than CO and residing in the atmosphere\n2\nfor up to 100 years. Being this potent, we are lucky that CFCs (and related compounds)\nremain a minor component of the atmosphere, yet they still represent almost 12% of the\nGlobal Warming that can be attributed to human activities.\nParticulate matter\nIn addition to gases we also have solid particles (some alive, some inorganic) suspended\nin the atmosphere, which go by the name particulate matter or aerosols (though these\nare not exactly the same they are often used synonymously). These include pollen, dust,\nash, salt, bacteria, viruses and soot. The great majority are natural in origin, with\nvolcanic eruptions, forest fires and dust blown from the surface by winds being the most\ncommon. Plants and algae can also release gases that react with existing atmospheric\ngases to produce aerosols such as sulfate compounds.\nEvery time you breathe in air you are taking particulates into your body, but for the most\npart our bodies have developed defenses to deal with them (including the good old\nsneeze). These airborne particles are so small that once injected into the atmosphere they\ndrift around the lowest layers of the atmosphere for days to years (in general the smaller\naerosols can stay adrift longer). Without particulate matter, cloud formation would not\nbe possible and the color of our sunsets would just not look the same.\nImage: Dust storm over the Arabian Peninsula, March 2011\nhttp:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/IOTD\/view.php?id=49892\nCheck out the following link for in in-depth look at these important components of our\natmosphere: http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/Aerosols\/\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver ATMOSPHERIC LAYERS\nIf you were to hop in a hot air balloon at the ground surface and begin rising through our\natmosphere, you\u2019d likely notice the air cooling off as you rise higher and higher. This\nmakes sense, as we tend to think of mountain tops as cold places and low elevations as\nwarmer places (Death Valley, CA is thought of as being a hot place at mid-day in part\ndue to its low elevation, parts of which are 280 feet or more below sea level). While this\nimpression is valid for the lower few miles of our atmosphere, a zone known as the\nTroposphere, the atmosphere acts completely different a few miles higher up. Let\u2019s\nexplore these atmospheric layers a little more thoroughly.\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atmospheric_layers#Principal_layers\nSource: NOAA (http:\/\/www.srh.noaa.gov\/images\/crp\/education\/temperature\/layers2.jpg)\nThe Troposphere is the lowest level of atmosphere found between 0 and approximately\n8 miles above sea level, within which temperature decreases as elevation increases. In\ngeneral, the troposphere extends higher in altitude towards the equator and is thinner\ntowards the poles. The troposphere is the only portion of the atmosphere we humans ever\nexplore, unless you are an astronaut or an Air Force test pilot. Almost all atmospheric\nmoisture and storms are found in the troposphere, as are the flights of commercial aircraft\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver and the tops of the highest mountains. Clearly, it is the most important layer of the\natmosphere for humans.\nThe Tropopause is the 2nd atmospheric level between about 8 and 12 miles, in which\ntemperature remains constant as elevation changes. It should be noted that (as with the\ntroposphere) the height of the tropopause is maximized at the equator and decreases in\nheight all the way to the poles.\nHeight of the Troposphere and Tropopause: http:\/\/www.srh.noaa.gov\/jetstream\/global\/jet.htm\nThe Stratosphere is the 3rd atmospheric level between about 12 and 28 miles, in which\nthe temperature rises as elevation increases. The temperature rise is due to increased\nozone concentrations which absorb the sun\u2019s energy and heat up (stratospheric ozone)\nThe Stratopause is the 4th atmospheric level and is located approximately 28 to 32 miles\nabove earth\u2019s surface. Temperature stays relatively unchanged as you increase elevation\nin the Stratopause.\nThe Mesosphere is the layer of the atmosphere from approximately 32 to 50 miles above\nearth\u2019s surface. Within this layer temperature decreases as elevation increases. Most\nmeteors that burn up upon entering earth\u2019s atmosphere do so here.\nBeyond the Mesosphere are the Thermosphere (where the International Space Station\norbits the earth) and the Exosphere, where only a few molecules of Helium and\nHydrogen exist but are still gravitationally attracted to earth. In essence, these two layers\nrepresent outer space in functional terms, and are more home to the field of Astronomy\nthan to Geography.\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver WHAT\u2019S the DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WEATHER and CLIMATE?\nWeather refers to the atmospheric conditions for a specific place and time. For example,\nat the very same moment Los Angeles\u2019 weather may be different than that of nearby\nPasadena, CA. Weather also changes constantly over time. It may well be raining one\nmoment only to have the skies clear a few minutes later. Some of the ways we describe\nthese atmospheric conditions are by observing, measuring and recording the following:\n1. Temperature\n2. Precipitation\n3. Cloud cover\n4. Humidity\n5. Wind speed and Direction\n6. Atmospheric Pressure\nClimate is the atmospheric condition for a large area over a long period of time and\ninvolves monthly maximums and minimums of mostly Temperature and Precipitation.\nDuration is the key difference between weather and climate, with weather being shorter\nin duration and climate being much longer (typically 30 years or more). Though\nPasadena and Glendale, CA have slightly different weather at any moment, they have the\nsame type of climate known as Mediterranean.\nCheck out http:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/mission_pages\/noaa-n\/climate\/climate_weather.html\nSEVEN FACTORS WHICH DETERMINE YOUR WEATHER\/CLIMATE\nThere are numerous reasons why two places on earth might experience different weather\nor climate, but in order to make an analysis manageable we have grouped these into\nseven main factors.\n1. Latitude\nIn general, it is colder at the poles and warmer in the tropics. This is largely a result of\nthe sun\u2019s energy being received towards the equator, with less solar energy reaching the\npolar regions. The following image (for April 2005) clearly shows that it is warmer\n(lighter colors) towards the tropics and colder (dark blue tones) towards the poles, which\ncan be expected in a general sense throughout the year.\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Source: http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/GlobalMaps\/view.php?d1=MOD11C1_M_LSTDA\n2. Elevation\nIn general, high elevation places tend to be colder than places at or below sea level. High\nmountains like California\u2019s Mount Whitney (14,494\u2019 elevation) are cold and dry places,\nwhile the adjacent Owens Valley (approx. 4-5,000\u2019 elevation) tends to be much warmer.\nThe same is true of the foothills of South America\u2019s Andes mountain chain. The lower\nfoothills are much warmer than the high snow-packed peaks, as shown in this photo from\nArgentina\u2019s El Chalt\u00e9n region.\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver 3. Distance from a large water body\nCoastal locations like Santa Monica, CA have more moisture in the air, which means\nsummers are cooler and winters milder than for more inland (drier) locations at the same\nlatitude like Pasadena, CA or even drier continental places like Phoenix, Arizona.\n4. Topographic (mountain) Barriers\nHigh barriers like mountains steal moisture on the windward side so that there\u2019s no water\nleft for the leeward (rainshadow) side. This helps explain why Santa Monica receives\nabout 13\u201d of rainfall annually, the top of the San Gabriel Mountains get about 40\u201d\nannually, while Palmdale and Lancaster (on the leeward side of the mountains) get about\n6\u201d annually. The winter rain just cannot get to the other side of the mountains.\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver 5. General Circulation of the Atmosphere\nOur atmosphere has a natural circulation patterns which promotes air rising (and cooling)\nat the equator. This constantly-rising equatorial air promotes the growth of clouds and\nrain, so that equatorial locations frequently receive 60 to 150\u201d or more of rain annually.\nConversely, this same atmospheric circulation pattern promotes the sinking of air close to\n30N and 30S latitude. This sinking air does not allow for the development of clouds, so\nthese areas tend to be occupied by dry deserts. The contrast of equatorial and subtropical\nweather\/climate is illustrated in the following NOAA map, where the red, orange and\nblue colors represent high precipitation totals, while the green and white colors represent\nrelatively low precipitation totals.\nSource: http:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/products\/Global_Monsoons\/gl_obs.shtml\n6. Oceanic Circulation\nLikewise, our oceans have a natural circulation pattern which in many ways mirrors our\nwind patterns. Northern Hemisphere currents turn constantly towards their right,\nresulting in a clockwise circulation pattern. This means warm equatorial waters will be\ndriven towards Florida along the current known as the Gulf Stream. The warm, moist air\nabove this current is pulled inland, giving Florida warm, humid summers with afternoon\nthunderstorms. Conversely, the West Coast of the USA is under the influence of the cold\nwater California Current, resulting in cool, stable air masses along the coast (this may\ngive morning fog but not afternoon thunderstorms in the summer).\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Map Courtesy of NOAA: http:\/\/www.adp.noaa.gov\/currents_map.html\n7. Storms\nThere is a pattern to the location of storms and the paths they follow, which we refer to as\n\u201cstorm tracks.\u201d Some places like Seattle, WA are located smack in the middle of storm\ntracks, giving them year-round potential for rainfall. Conversely, places like San Diego,\nCA are located on the edge of these storm tracks, resulting in less rainfall as the storms\nonly reach them in the midst of winter.\nSource: http:\/\/www.erh.noaa.gov\/btv\/images\/us_pcpn.png\n\u00a9Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Chapter 4: TEMPERATURE and INSOLATION\nWhen, on a hot summer day, the local television weather reporter exclaims \u201cWhoa, we\u2019re\ngoing to have a high of 40 degrees today\u201d, what does he\/she really mean? There\u2019s a big\ndifference between 40 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Furthermore, what are\nwe really measuring when we take the temperature? What exactly is solar radiation, and\nhow can it still feel \u2018hot\u2019 even after traveling 93 million miles from the sun? What\nhappens to this energy once it reaches the Earth? Why is the sky blue at noon and\norange-red at sunset? Let\u2019s get into the details so we can answer these questions and\nmore.\nTemperature is defined as the measure of heat energy stored in a substance or object.\nHeat is one form of energy which is related to how molecules move, mainly in the form\nof molecular vibrations and molecular collisions. In essence, air\nmolecules with lots of energy vibrate and collide more\nfrequently than those with less energy. As they collide more\noften, the molecules tend to spread out (disperse), thereby\nincreasing the volume of the air. Think of a set of racked balls\non a pool table as molecules with low energy. Then add an\nenergy source (the analogy would be \u2018putting some heat\u2019 onto\nthe racked balls by hitting a cue ball into them at high speed).\nOnce contact is made, the racked balls will disperse all over the pool table, just like\nmolecules do when sufficient heat energy is transferred into them.\nThis heat energy can be measured using a simple thermometer, which consists of a\nvolume of fluid with known behavior (usually alcohol or Mercury) sealed within a long\nglass vacuum enclosure. Let\u2019s take this device outside on a cold winter morning. As the\nsun rises and heats the atmosphere, some of this heat is conducted through the glass and\ninto the fluid, so the molecules begin to collide more and the fluid expands in volume.\nThe fluid then rises into the long tube, and we can mark off the point at which ice begins\nto melt. We\u2019ll mark this point on the thermometer and call this \u201czero\u201d. We could then\ntake our device inside and put it inside a pot of boiling water. If we mark off the place on\nthe thermometer where the contained fluid level has risen to as the water boils, we can\ncall this \u201cone grade\u201d. So, 1 grade is the difference in temperature between ice melting\nand water boiling, and our thermometer can clearly show this difference based on the\nheight of the fluid.\nWe can then divide this \u2018grade\u2019 into 100 equal parts, each of them representing 1 degree\nCentigrade (\u2018centi\u2019 means one hundredth of a unit, just as a centimeter is a 100th of a\nmeter). This also means that water melts\/freezes at 0 degrees Centigrade and water boils\nat 100 degrees Centigrade. Centigrade is also known as Celsius, based on the founder of\nthis system of measuring temperature, and is abbreviated as \u00baC.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Image: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thermometer\nThe USA insists on being just about the only remaining country on Earth to use an older\nsystem of temperature measurement known as the Fahrenheit (or \u00baF) scale. In this scale,\nwater boils at 212\u00baF and freezes\/melts at 32\u00baF.\nConverting Between Temperature Scales\nC to F:\nF= (C x 1.8) + 32\nExample: given 40 C, find F\n(40 x 1.8) + 32 = F\n72 + 32 = F\n104 = F\nF to C: (basically, everything is REVERSED)\nC = (F \u2013 32)\/ 1.8\nExample: given 212 F, find C\n(212 \u2013 32)\/ 1.8 = C\n180\/ 1.8 = C\n100 = C\nYouTube example: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OxD7E0-x7Mk&feature=related\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Insolation (Incoming Solar Radiation)\nIncoming\u2026to Earth\nSolar\u2026from the sun\nRadiation\u2026electromagnetic radiation, largely in\nthe form of waves of energy\nSo Insolation is electromagnetic radiation emitted from the sun which then travels across\nspace towards Earth. A very small portion (0.5 of a billionth of the energy released from\nthe sun) actually reaches the Earth. By this time the solar energy has traveled about 93\nmillion miles in an average time of 8.3 minutes.\nELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM\nThe energy from the sun travels across space mostly in the form of a package of\nelectromagnetic waves, each with a different wavelength, frequency (number of waves\nemitted per second) and energy. Wavelength (\u03bb) is the most common way of\ndifferentiating the types of electromagnetic waves, and is defined as the distance between\nthe crest of two successive waves (see below).\nShort wavelength: High energy\nHot objects like stars have short\nwavelengths with high energy.\nLong wavelength: Low energy\nThe package of electromagnetic radiation consists of an entire range (spectrum) of\nwavelengths, which is broken down into individual sections called gamma ray, x-ray,\nultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave, and radio waves (see the diagram on the\nfollowing page). Gamma rays have wavelengths a fraction of the size of an atom, while\nradio waves have wavelengths longer than ten football fields. Check out this NASA link\nfor a tour of the Electromagnetic Spectrum. https:\/\/science.nasa.gov\/ems\/01_intro\nOnly super-hot objects like stars (including our sun) are capable of emitting short, high-\nenergy wavelengths like gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet and visible light. Lucky for us,\nour upper atmosphere absorbs or reflects away almost all of these potentially-dangerous\nwavelengths, but some of this high-intensity radiation does make it through to the earth\u2019s\nsurface, especially some of the ultraviolet wavelengths as well as the visible portion of\nthe spectrum. These wavelengths with the ability to pass (to be transmitted) through the\natmosphere are referred to as \"atmospheric windows.\" As the following diagram shows,\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver this also includes some very long-wavelength microwaves and radio waves, but these are\nentirely harmless to life forms on earth. Please note that the top of the following diagram\nshows \u201cY\u201d and \u201cN\u201d columns to indicate whether each particular wavelength of insolation\nis transmitted all the way through the atmosphere. In actuality these designations are\nshowing whether or not \u201cmost\u201d of the particular wavelength makes it through, not \u201call\u201d\nthe wavelength. For instance, the diagram appears to show that ultraviolet wavelengths\ndo not make it through the atmosphere. Instead, this should be read to mean that MOST\nof the ultraviolet entering the top of the atmosphere does not make it all the way to\nearth\u2019s surface.\nSource: http:\/\/mynasadata.larc.nasa.gov\/images\/EM_Spectrum3-new.jpg\nThe longer wavelengths of the insolation (infrared, microwave, and radio waves) are\nharmless to humans. We can\u2019t see them, and for the most part we don\u2019t feel them, but\nthink about this. When you go for a fun afternoon at the beach, you apply sunscreen and\nsettle onto your beach blanket. Looking up towards the sky you can see the bright yellow\nsun and a blue sky (among other things). In this case your eyes are making sense of the\nvisible wavelengths. You feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, which means your\nbody is sensing the presence of infrared wavelengths. Finally, if you didn\u2019t put enough\nsunscreen on, you might find your exposed skin to be a little sunburned later that\nevening. This is the effect of prolonged exposure to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet wavelengths\n(UV-A and UV-B).\nThe central portion of the spectrum contains wavelengths known as visible light, and this\nportion of the spectrum can itself be divided into separate wavelengths, each representing\na specific color of the rainbow. The longest-wavelength of the visible portion of the\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver spectrum is Red while the shortest-wavelength portion is Violet. From red to violet the\nwavelengths get progressively shorter, with a resulting color order of Red, Orange,\nYellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and finally Violet. This is often remembered by the\nacronym Roy G. Biv.\nImage Courtesy of http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Linear_visible_spectrum.svg\nIt is important to remember that this is the only portion of the electromagnetic spectrum\nthat our eyes can see. If a wavelength is shorter than that of violet, the wavelength would\nbe in the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum, which is invisible to us. Wavelengths\nslightly longer than those of the color red would fall into the infrared portion of the\nspectrum, and again these would be invisible to us.\nThe sun sends all of these individual visible wavelengths towards earth as part of the\nbeam of insolation. For astronauts viewing this energy beyond the top of our atmosphere,\nthe sun would appear bright white in color. This is because the cumulative result of\nadding all the visible wavelengths together (from red to violet) is the color white. The\nreason we don\u2019t see a brilliant white sun down on the earth\u2019s surface will be explained\nshortly. For now, we\u2019ll conclude our discussion of visible light by asking the question\n\u201cwhat makes a green t-shirt green?\u201d Have you ever thought about that? Many of us\nwould just say \u201cit\u2019s easy\u2026it\u2019s because the shirt is green, silly!\u201d But I can easily turn\nyour green shirt to a dark black color by placing it in a dark room and closing the doors\nand windows! So, to make a green shirt appear green in color, we need a source of light.\nIn a lighted situation, especially in sunlight, the specific materials and pigments that the\nshirt was manufactured from absorb most other wavelengths and reflect the green\nwavelengths back to our eyes. Our eyes and brain recognize the reflected \u201cgreen\u201d\nwavelength as the color green. More about reflection and absorption a little later, but let\nme leave you with this thought: Would an object which is white in color represent more,\nor less reflection than an object that is black in color?\nRadiation Laws\nWein\u2019s Law states that the hotter a celestial body (a star or planet), the shorter the peak\nwavelength of radiation emitted by that body. This means that since the sun is much\nhotter than the earth (11,000\u00b0F at the surface), the sun emits much shorter peak\nwavelengths than does earth (with an average surface temperature of 60\u00b0F).\nIn fact, visible light accounts for fully half of the wavelengths emitted from the sun, with\nan additional 7% emitted in the ultraviolet and shorter wavelengths, so we classify the\nsun as an emitter of short wavelength radiation.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver This short wavelength energy emitted from the sun makes its way across space and then,\n93 million miles later, a small fraction hits the top of Earth\u2019s\natmosphere. Every place at the top of the atmosphere which is pointing\ntowards the sun receives a constant amount of energy known as the\nsolar constant, measured at 2 calories\/cm2\/minute. One cm2 or \u201csquare\ncentimeter\u201d is about the size of one side of a sugar cube, and there are\ntrillions of square centimeters at the top of our atmosphere, each receiving 2 calories of\nsolar energy every minute!\nHowever, this solar energy still has to make it through the atmosphere in order for us to\nfeel it, but not all of this energy will make it through to the surface of the Earth.\nFOUR THINGS HAPPEN TO INSOLATION as it travels through the atmosphere\nhttp:\/\/www.srh.weather.gov\/jetstream\/atmos\/energy_balance.htm\nHere\u2019s a good NASA link describing reflection and absorption, among other astronomical\nphenomena https:\/\/science.nasa.gov\/ems\/13_radiationbudget\n1. Reflection: The insolation is bounced back to space by earth\u2019s atmosphere and\nsurface. This is why we can see earth from space, as the reflected light remains\nvisible to astronauts. Clouds and other components of the atmosphere are responsible\nfor reflecting about 25% of the insolation, while the earth\u2019s surface (especially ice,\nsnow, light-colored sand and rocks, and salt) is responsible for reflecting about 6%.\nFor example, walking barefoot on light-colored beach sand on a summer afternoon\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver does not tend to burn your feet because the light sand is better at reflecting solar\nenergy than it is at absorbing it.\nSince the atmosphere reflects 25% of the available insolation, and the earth\u2019s surface\nreflects 6% of the insolation, the total percentage of insolation that earth reflects back to\nspace (known as earth\u2019s albedo) is 31 percent.\n2. Absorption: The insolation is captured (absorbed) by Earth\u2019s atmosphere and\nsurface. Typically, dark materials are better absorbers than light colored materials.\n4% absorbed by clouds\n19% absorbed by rest of atmosphere\n46% absorbed by earth\u2019s surface\n4 + 19 + 46 = 69% absorbed\nOf the 100% insolation reaching the top of earth\u2019s atmosphere, approximately 4% is\nabsorbed by clouds, 3% by ozone, 16% by the remainder of the atmosphere, and fully\n46% is absorbed at earth\u2019s surface, especially by the oceans (which appear dark blue in\ncolor), plants, dark rocks, and man-made surfaces like house roofs and asphalt paving.\nThis clearly shows that the place which absorbs most of the sun\u2019s incoming energy is the\nsurface of the earth.\n3. Scattering (aka Diffusion Radiation) refers to the process where short wavelengths are\n\u201cbounced off\u201d the main beam of insolation by nitrogen, oxygen, and especially by small\nparticulate matter (dust, soot, ice, ash and salt) in the atmosphere, leaving only the longer\nwavelengths in the incoming beam of radiation.\nFor the visible portion of the spectrum, violet-indigo (short)\nwavelengths are most-affected by scattering, while orange-red\nwavelengths are least-affected.\nDuring daytime hours, the sun\u2019s rays pass through a thin layer of\natmosphere, so the sun appears yellow as dust in the atmosphere\nscatters away only short wavelengths (v-i-b) and leaves longer\nwavelengths (g-y-o-r) to be viewed by us.\nAt sunrise and sunset, the sun\u2019s rays must travel a longer path\nthrough the atmosphere, and much of this path is through layers\ncontaining lots of particulate matter. Almost all of the\nwavelengths are scattered away, leaving an orange-red sun with a\nyellow-orange sky.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver This effect can be exaggerated on very smoggy days or following a forest fire. The\npresence of excessive dust, particulates or ash creates a very red sunset because the extra\nparticles in the air scatter away more insolation.\n4. Transmission or Filtering Short wavelength energy from the sun is transmitted\nthrough the atmosphere and this energy is absorbed by the Earth\u2019s surface. The heated\nsurface on earth then heats up and emits long wavelength energy back towards space, but\ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere (water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, etc.) don\u2019t let\nit escape easily, temporarily heating the lower atmosphere.\nENERGY TRANSFER MECHANISMS\nSo the Earth ultimately reflects about 31% of the solar energy available to us back into\nspace, and we absorb about 69%. This energy is not absorbed equally on the planet, and\nit makes sense that the tropical regions would absorb more than polar locations. In fact,\nthere is a general surplus of energy being absorbed in the tropical and sub-tropical\nregions (approximately 30N to 30S) and a general deficit of energy absorbed pole-ward\nof 30N and 30S. With this in mind, it would appear logical that the tropical regions\nshould be warming up and the polar regions (with an energy deficit) should be cooling\ndown. The reality is quite different. The tropical regions are indeed warming up, but the\npolar regions are warming up faster than all other places on earth. The reason for this is\nthat energy received in the tropical regions is being transferred towards the poles.\nThe Earth has the following mechanisms to transfer energy away from places where the\nenergy is absorbed so that these regions never get too hot (the first three are described\nquite well in the following link. https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/heat\n1. Re-radiation: Earth absorbs (captures) insolation, warms up, then emits long\nwavelengths back to space. Again, since most energy is absorbed at the earth\u2019s\nsurface, re-radiation allows the surface to cool down by transferring energy to the\nbottom of the atmosphere as long wavelengths are emitted. The effect is that the\nlower atmosphere tends to warm from the bottom-up.\n2. Conduction: Absorbed energy is also transmitted through the process of\nconduction, the transfer of \u2018sensible\u2019 heat from a hot object to a cooler object when\nIN CONTACT (touching). For example, an asphalt parking lot absorbs a lot of\ninsolation during the daytime, and in the process it heats up. Any atmospheric\nmolecules that come into contact with the heated asphalt will see a sharing of the\nheat: the atmospheric molecules hear up and the asphalt in turn, cools down. Again,\nthis energy transfer mechanism occurs only when objects are in contact. The heated\nmolecule has more energy and moves around the lower atmosphere to find a cooler\nmolecule and process of heat transfer continues.\n3. Atmospheric Convection is the vertical and horizontal mixing of air. Warm air is\nless dense, therefore more buoyant, and wants to rise. As the warm air rises it pulls in\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver cooler air from the sides, which then absorbs energy from the surface, warms up and\nalso rises. This pulls cooler air downward, creating a loop known as a convection\ncell. This allows energy absorbed at the surface to be circulated around in the lower\natmosphere very efficiently.\n4. Latent (hidden) Heat Transfer involves a phase change of water from a solid, liquid\nor gas. In essence, it requires energy to turn ice into liquid water, or to turn liquid\nwater into water vapor (a gas). The energy required to do this stays with the higher\nphase (form) of water. For example, a tremendous amount of solar energy is required\nto evaporate water into water vapor. When this occurs, the energy cannot be seen but\nis in fact \u2018hidden\u2019 in the evaporated water molecules, which are now vibrating and\ncolliding much more frequently. When the air containing the vapor rises and cools,\nthe vapor may condense, forming a cloud of suspended liquid droplets. The energy\nthat was absorbed as the water was evaporated at the surface is now released into the\ncloud as the water vapor condenses. This is a very effective way of transferring\nenergy.\n5. Oceanic and atmospheric circulation is probably the most effective method of\ntransferring heat from one place on earth to another. In essence, energy absorbed at\none location can be carried by wind or ocean currents and physically moved to\nanother location. Globally, we see a general trend of equatorial energy being moved\ntowards the poles, but we\u2019ll explore this more in an upcoming chapter.\n7 CONTROLS OF TEMPERATURE (same factors as for weather and climate)\n1. Latitude\n2. Distance from a large water body\n3. Elevation\n4. Atmospheric circulation\n5. Oceanic circulation\n6. Topographic barriers\n7. Storm tracks\nFocus on Distance from a Large Water Body: Maritime vs. Continental Locations\nPlaces located along the coastline of an ocean, sea or large lake usually have a year-round\nabundance of moisture in the air. The presence of moisture influences not only the\nannual rainfall amounts of coastal locations, but also affects their temperature. Coastal\n(Maritime) locations tend to have mild summer temperatures, mild winter temperatures,\nmild temperatures at sunrise, and mild temperatures in the middle of the afternoon. In\nessence, the presence of moisture in the air means that temperatures don\u2019t get too hot or\ntoo cold when compared to inland (Continental) locations. This can be measured in a\ncouple of main ways, notably the Annual Temperature Range (ATR) and Daily\nTemperature Range (DTR).\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver ATR (Annual Temperature Range) is the average temperature of the warmest month\nminus the average temperature of the coolest month. The range (difference) tends to be\nsmall for coastal places and large for continental (and dry) places. For three Southern\nCalifornia examples, Santa Monica Pier\u2019s ATR is about 10\u00b0F, Pasadena\u2019s is about 21\u00b0F,\nand Palm Springs\u2019 is approximately 36\u00b0F.\nHere\u2019s a Climograph showing the annual pattern of rainfall (bars) and temperature (line)\nfor downtown Los Angeles. As for most places on the planet, the highest average\nmonthly temperatures are experienced a month or two after the summer solstice, with the\nminimum average monthly temperatures being recorded a month or two after the winter\nsolstice. For downtown Los Angeles, these months are August-September and January-\nFebruary, respectively.\nCheck out the following link and determine the ATR\u2019s for four Central California places\n(the list is sorted alphabetically): Monterey, Fresno, Mammoth Lakes, and Death Valley.\nhttp:\/\/ggweather.com\/normals\/CA.html\nDo you notice a trend at all? Do you think there might be a test question about this?\nA second way to quantify the effect of moisture in the air is through Daily Temperature\nrange (DTR), which is the maximum temperature for a day minus the low temperature\nfor a day. The DTR for Santa Monica, just like the ATR, is lower than that of an inland\ncity like Pasadena, and much lower than Palm Springs. The graph below (source\nunknown) shows that most places, all other things being equal, get their minimum daily\ntemperature right around sunrise (note that sunrise is earlier in the summer and later in\nthe winter). The maximum daily temperature is usually received in the middle of the\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver afternoon (2-4pm is typical), where incoming energy from the sun is balanced by\noutgoing energy from the heated surface of the earth.\nFor August 27, 2011, Santa Monica\u2019s DTR was 5F (70-65), Pasadena\u2019s was 29F (103-\n74), Riverside\u2019s was 37F (108-71) and Palm Springs\u2019 DTR was 23F (112-89). The lower\nthan expected DTR for Palm Springs was due to the presence of moisture sneeking in\nfrom the Gulf of California, making the air a little more moist and providing some\nlocalized thunderstorms. This shows that although we can make sense of the atmosphere,\nit is a very fluid environment with many variables to consider at any given moment. This\nis why predicting the weather is so delicate, and often wrong! We\u2019ll explore these\ncomplexities in the upcoming chapters.\nFocus on Topographic (Mountain) Barriers\nAs described in the previous chapter, mountain barriers can play an important role in\n\u2018stealing\u2019 moisture on the windward side (the side facing the wind) leaving very little\nmoisture on the down-wind (leeward) side, and creating what\u2019s referred to as a rain\nshadow.\nThese same mountain barriers can have an enormous impact on temperature, creating\nvery hot temperatures on the leeward side under certain conditions. For example, a\nspring-time storm may bring cool weather to Los Angeles along with wet weather to the\nSan Gabriel Mountains above the city, but this same storm may help create warmer and\ndry conditions on the leeward side of the mountains, even at slightly higher elevation.\nThe reason for this is that as the air rises over the mountains on the windward side, it\ntends to cool and water vapor condenses to form clouds. As the process of condensation\nprogresses, latent heat is released into the forming cloud, so that the rising air cools very\nslowly.\nIn fact, condensing air tends to cool at a rate of approximately 3\u00b0F for every 1,000 feet of\nelevation gain, while air that rises without any water condensing out cools at a much\nfaster rate of 5.5\u00b0F per thousand feet of elevation gain. Air that sinks never forms clouds,\nso this air will warm up at a rate of 5.5F per thousand feet of elevation loss.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Here\u2019s an example:\nSo why does rising air cool down in the first place? The answer is because of Adiabatic\nCooling, the change in heat energy due to the changing density of rising air. To fully\ncomprehend this, we have to remember that heat energy is related to the vibrations and\ncollisions of molecules. Air that rises from the earth\u2019s surface experiences lower air\npressure and tends to expand as a result of this lowered air pressure. The molecules\nwithin this air now tend to vibrate and collide less often, so the air cools down.\nConversely, air that sinks in the atmosphere is \u2018crushed\u2019 tighter together as it descends.\nThe higher pressure means that molecules tend to collide and vibrate more often,\nresulting in higher temperatures (this is called Adiabatic Heating). So, why does air\ncool quickly when it rises without forming clouds, but that same air cools slowly when it\nrises while forming clouds? I\u2019ll leave the answer to you\u2026but I know you can find it!\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Ch. 5 Atmospheric Pressure\nOur atmosphere extends hundreds of miles out from the earth\u2019s surface, though most\nscientists agree by the time you get about 100km (62 miles) from the surface there are\nvery few molecules remaining. In fact, about 95% of the atmosphere\u2019s molecules are\nfound in the bottom 16 miles, and 50% of the molecules are found in the lowest 4 miles\nof the atmosphere. In fact, people who climb mountains 4 miles (about 23,000 feet) high\nare breathing air with only half as many molecules (including oxygen) as compared to sea\nlevel, which makes it very difficult to breath or even think straight at those elevations.\nThere are more molecules at the bottom of the atmosphere\nbecause they are being pulled towards the earth surface by\ngravity. The air at the bottom of the atmosphere feels the\nweight of all the molecules above pushing downwards, and\nthis is referred to as \u201cair Pressure.\u201d It\u2019s sort of like the guy\non the bottom of a \u2018dog pile\u2019 after winning the World Series\n(the guy on the bottom is feeling the pressure\u2014he\u2019s red in\nthe face and eyes are about to pop out).\nSo how do we measure this air pressure? Well, back in the early 1600\u2019s\na number of early scientists were experimenting with long water-filled\ntubes in a quest to create a vacuum within the tube. The debates which\nfollowed spurned Torricelli to argue that the atmosphere indeed had\nweight (a novel concept at the time) which he proved by using a tube\nfilled with Mercury rather than water. Mercury (Hg) is a heavy metal\nwhich is liquid at most temperatures on Earth and about 14 times the\nweight of water, so a much shorter glass tube can be used. Torricelli\u2019s\ninvention, known as a Mercury Barometer, allowed people to measure\nthe \u201cweight\u201d or \u201cpressure\u201d of the atmosphere in relation to the height of\nMercury being pushed up within the tube by the force of the atmosphere\noutside the tube (see the diagram to the right). The atmosphere\u2019s weight\npushes down on the glass tube (a vacuum tube) and the mercury level\nrises. Note that if the atmosphere pushes down harder than normal, the\nheight of the mercury within the tube will get higher. Mercury\nBarometer\nIf we used a barometer to measure atmospheric pressure at multiple places over the planet\nand calibrated for sea-level, we would find the average seal-level air pressure for Earth.\nAverage atmospheric pressure (at sea level)\n76 cm Hg\n760 mm Hg\n29.92 inches Hg\n14.7 psi (pounds per square inch)\n1 bar (or 1 atmosphere)\n1,000 millibars (mb) or more accurately\u20261,013.25 mb\n1,013.25 hectopascals (hPa)\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Here\u2019s a good National Weather Service link about atmospheric pressure:\nhttps:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/pressure\nEvery square inch of your body has 14.7 psi of air pressure pushing in from all directions.\nWe don\u2019t crush inwards because our bodies have adapted by pushing outwards with the\nsame force. However, if we travel quickly to high elevations (where there\u2019s less air\npressure) we find our bodies don\u2019t quickly adapt to the lower air pressure.\nExample: Snowboarders can experience headaches because at high elevation\n(and less air pressure than at sea-level) the body is pushing out with more\npressure than the atmosphere is pushing in. There is a lack of equilibrium.\nNow, we must remember that Average Sea-Level Pressure is just that\u2026the\naverage at sea-level. Sometimes the sea-level pressure can be higher than\naverage (High Pressure) and at other times it can be lower than average (Low Pressure),\nwhich leads us to the following terms:\nHigh pressure is defined as air pressure significantly higher than the average for the\nsurrounding area. We can over-generalize here and say that High Pressure is that which\nis greater than 1013.25mb. We can locate areas of high pressure by taking a barometer\nreading at the surface of the earth and then re-calculating this for elevation (we\nrecalculate to see what the pressure would be if we were at sea level). What we find are\ncentral areas of high pressure (called High Pressure\nCells if circular in shape or High Pressure Ridges if\nlinear). Within High Pressure Cells the air is sinking\nand warming up as it descends, creating clear skies.\nHigh pressure cells are also known as Anticyclones,\nand are partly responsible for the presence of smoggy\ndays in Los Angeles as well as the formation of dry\nSanta Ana winds.\nA High Pressure Cell in USA. http:\/\/www.wrh.noaa.gov\/images\/twc\/monsoon\/july.gif\nLow pressure is defined as air pressure significantly\nlower than the surrounding area (we can cheat a little\nand say that Low Pressure is less than 1013.25mb).\nAn area of low pressure is associated with rising air\nwhich is cooling as it ascends, often producing clouds.\nClouds, rain and storms are always associated with\nareas of Low Pressure. Low Pressure Centers\n(Cyclones) migrating from the Pacific Ocean are\nlargely responsible for our winter moisture in Southern\nCalifornia.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver So Where Do Sinking and Rising Air Go?\nAir that sinks in a high pressure cell (anticylone) hits the bottom of the troposphere and\nthen moves outwards in all directions along the earth\u2019s surface, away from high pressure\nand towards areas of lower surface air pressure. The air flowing across the surface (we\ncall it WIND) is driven by the Pressure Gradient Force (or PGF), which basically tells\nair to try and move from high surface pressure towards low surface pressure. Wind is\nalways driven by the PGF, so it always tries to move from HIGH to LOW surface\npressure.\nUpper-Level and Surface Winds\nAs the above diagram shows, there are two basic groups of winds: Geostrophic Winds\nare found at high elevation where they can\u2019t bump into anything, so they move quite fast.\nFriction Layer Winds are located at the bottom of the troposphere. As these winds\nmove horizontally across the earth\u2019s surface they are slowed down by bumping into and\nrubbing against (hence, friction) obstacles like mountains, valleys, trees, people and\nbuildings, so they have a much slower speed than high-altitude winds.\nShowing High and Low Pressure Areas on Weather Maps\nThe diagram shown above is drawn as if you were looking across the earth\u2019s surface\ntowards the horizon, with the ground on the bottom of the diagram and the atmosphere\nextending towards the top of the diagram. Weather maps show High and Low Pressure\nCenters in a \u2018plan view\u2019 orientation, as if you were looking down from a satellite with the\nsurface of the map representing earth\u2019s surface. On weather maps the locations of high\nand low pressure centers are identified by the capital letters L and H, which are enclosed\nby lines of equal pressure called Isobars (see the following diagram).\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver There are several isobars identified on this diagram, specifically the 1023, 1020, 1017,\n1014, 1011, 1008 and 1005 mb isobars. For each of these isobars, any location on the\nsame line represents an equal amount of atmospheric pressure. In addition, there are two\nsmall dots visible on the diagram, one is green and the other is red. The red dot is located\njust to the right of the 1014mb isobar (in this case we only see a small portion of this\nisobar), so the air pressure for the red dot would be just less than 1014mb. The green dot\nis located between the 1017 and 1020mb isobars, but closer to 1017, so the air pressure\nfor that location can be estimated at very close to 1018mb. The gold-colored lines on this\ndiagram represent the Pressure Gradient Force, showing the direction that air will attempt\nto move; Away from High Pressure and towards Low Pressure. Please keep in mind that\nevery direction away from the center of high pressure would in fact be towards lower\npressure.\nThe isobar contour interval on the map is 3mb, which is not always the case. Where the\nisobars are located close together the pressure is changing quickly over a short distance\n(let\u2019s say in 100 miles), and where the isobars are spaced far apart, the pressure doesn\u2019t\nchange much over that same 100 miles. This rate of change of atmospheric pressure per\nunit distance is referred to as the Pressure Gradient. If the Pressure Gradient is large,\nthis means that in a small geographic area there are places with much different\natmospheric pressure, and nature will want to even this difference out quickly by moving\nextra air molecules from the area of higher pressure towards the area of lower pressure.\nThe greater the difference in pressure between two nearby places (shown by closely-\nspaced isobars), the greater is the rush of molecules. The force of air molecules from\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver high to low pressure is referred to as the Pressure Gradient Force or PGF as discussed\non the previous pages. If the PGF is small, a slow evening-out of molecules creates a\nmild breeze along earth\u2019s surface. If the PGF is quite large, we might instead experience\nvery strong winds.\nHere\u2019s a National Weather Service map showing atmospheric pressure over the USA in\nOctober 2006. Can you clearly see the high and low pressure areas as well as the\ncorresponding isobars? What is the isobar contour interval for this map?\nThe Coriolis Force\nBesides gravity, friction, and the PGF, there is a fourth force acting on air as it moves\nacross the surface. The Coriolis Force (or Coriolis Effect) is created as the earth rotates\nwest-to-east once every 24 hours. Since the equator moves almost 25,000 miles in 24\nhours and the poles move 0 miles as they rotate, there is a large differential in the angular\nmomentum created (the equator moves at a rate of over 1,000 mph while the poles move\nat a rate of 0 mph).\nClick on the following links for descriptions of the Coriolis Force.\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mcPs_OdQOYU&feature=related\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aeY9tY9vKgs&feature=related\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver The effect of the Coriolis Force is to \u201cbend\u201d moving currents of air and water to the:\n- Right of the intended path (clockwise) in the Northern Hemisphere\n- Left of the intended path (counter clockwise) in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe Coriolis force is the greatest at the POLES and with FAST WINDS. There is no\nbending at the equator or with air that is standing still (not moving). Essentially, air\nmoving just north of the equator will be bent slightly to the right by the Coriolis Force.\nAir in the Mid-Latitudes will feel a stronger force bending to the right, and air at the\npoles will feel the strongest influence of the Coriolis Force.\nSo air moving horizontally (wind) within the troposphere feels the following all at once:\n1. Gravity, pulling air molecules towards earth\u2019s surface\n2. The Pressure Gradient Force, sending air molecules away from high pressure and\ntowards low pressure, thereby creating wind\n3. Friction, slowing the wind as it \u2018drags\u2019 along the earth\u2019s surface. Friction is\ninsignificant for high-altitude winds.\n4. The Coriolis Force, bending the wind to the right of its intended path in the\nNorthern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This force is\nstrongest at the Poles and for fast wind speeds.\nUpper-Level Air Flow\nAt high altitude, the lack of friction means that wind speeds are very fast, so the Coriolis\nForce is strong enough to equal the PGF. This results in clock-wise circular air motion\naround high pressure centers and counter-clockwise circulation around low pressure\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver centers in the Northern Hemisphere, with the opposite flow directions for the Southern\nHemisphere.\nFriction-Layer Air Flow\nAir moving out of a High Pressure Center will spread out across the surface of the earth\nin all directions (as a wind) which is then bent in a spiral, outwards pattern to the right in\nthe Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. We refer to this as\nAnti-Cyclonic flow.\nIt is the surface winds around low pressure centers which are more difficult to envision,\nbut let\u2019s give it a shot. Wind moving across the surface (friction layer) towards a Low\nPressure Center in the Northern Hemisphere will feel a tug-of-way effect between the\nopposing forces of the PGF and the Coriolis Force. The PGF will try to pull the air\nmolecules in the Low Pressure Center, while the Coriolis Force will try to bend the air to\nthe right. Since friction slows surface winds down, the PGF is stronger than the Coriolis\nForce, and the net effect is a slight bending towards the left. This bending motion\nincreases as the air gets closer and closer to the Low pressure Center, where the air\nultimately rises with an inward, counter-clockwise spiral motion that we call Cyclonic.\nThe net result is that air moving across the surface (friction layer) in the Northern\nHemisphere produces the following realities:\nAreas of low pressure (where the air is rising, cooling, and forming clouds) rotate\ncounter-clockwise with an inward spiral, what we refer to as Cyclonic Flow.\nAreas of high pressure (where the air is sinking from clear skies and warming\nadiabatically) rotate clockwise with an outward spiral, what we call Anticyclonic\nFlow.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver This link might help to visualize high and low pressure cells in the Northern Hemisphere:\nhttp:\/\/ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu\/(Gh)\/wwhlpr\/anticyclone_ani.rxml?hret=\/guides\/maps\/sfc\/\ntemp\/sfctmpslp.rxml\nFor the Southern Hemisphere the direction of rotation is completely reversed.\nhttp:\/\/www.bom.gov.au\/lam\/Students_Teachers\/pressure.shtml#high (So. Hemisphere only)\nSo Let\u2019s Put This All Together\nIn summary, we see that gravity pulls atmospheric molecules (air) towards earth\u2019s\nsurface. The Pressure Gradient Force directs the air from areas of High Pressure towards\nareas of Low Pressure. At the surface of the earth, where the moving air experiences\nenough friction to slow its movement, a battle between the PGF and a weaker Coriolis\nForce results in air spiraling out from High Pressure Centers (clockwise in the Northern\nHemisphere) while air spirals inward (counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere)\ntowards Low Pressure Centers. With upper-level air flow there is very little friction,\nhence the Coriolis Force and PGF are of equal strength. Here, the air flows in a\ncontinuous circular pattern around the High and Low Pressure Centers rather than into or\naway from them.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver GLOBAL WIND AND PRESSURE BELTS\nNow that we\u2019ve seen how high and low pressure belts and winds are related to one\nanother, as well as the forces which subsequently bend the winds, let\u2019s take a look at the\nmajor pressure and wind belts encircling the planet.\nhttp:\/\/www.srh.weather.gov\/jetstream\/global\/circ.htm\nThe diagram above and text (below) from the National Weather Service identify three\ndistinct atmospheric circulations cells known as the:\n1. Hadley cell \u2013 A large convection cell with rising air at the equator which then diverges at high\naltitude, producing upper-air flow away from the equator. This air descends to create a high\npressure zone in the sub-tropics. Air then flows back along the earth\u2019s surface from the subtropics\nto the equator, providing air flow for the Trade Winds.\n2. Ferrel cell - A mid-latitude cell with descending air in the sub-tropics and rising air in the sub-\npolar regions. The surface air flow between the high and low pressure areas powers the Westerly\nwinds of the mid-latitudes.\n3. Polar cell - Air rising in the sub-polar regions splits at high altitude, with a portion of that air\nflowing towards the poles where it sinks in a vortex. This sinking air creates a zone of high\npressure at the poles which in turn powers the polar easterly winds as surface air attempts to return\nto low pressure in the sub-polar region.\nThe model of the Hadley, Ferrel and Polar Cells explains the presence of major global\npressure belts located at the equator and every 30 degrees of latitude from there. These\nseven global pressure belts can be identified as follows:\nInter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ): a.k.a. Equatorial Low or Doldrums. This is\na zone of low pressure located at the equator. The low pressure means rising air, which\ncools on its way up, producing clouds and rain. Because of this the equator is one of the\nwettest regions in the world.\nSub Tropical High Pressure Zone (STHPZ): There are two zones of high pressure\nlocated approximately 30 degrees north and south of the equator. These areas of high\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver pressure provide sinking, dry air to the sub-tropics year-round, and are a major factor in\ndetermining the location of the world\u2019s largest deserts such as the Sahara of North Africa.\nSub Polar Low Pressure Zone: These zones, associated with both the Polar Front and\nthe Polar Jet Stream, are located approximately 60 degrees north and south of the equator.\nThese are zones of rising air which produce year-round moisture, especially along the\nwestern coastlines of continents at these\nlatitudes. The Sub-Polar Low separates\nwarm air on the equatorial side from very\ncold, dry air on the polar side. Also of note is\nthe location of the Polar Jet Stream, a fast,\neastward-moving river of air located about\n40,000 feet in the troposphere directly above\nthe Sub-Polar Low. This river of air can\neasily travel 100-150 mph, and can push jet\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver airplanes faster as they travel from west-to-east at these latitudes. For this reason, is it\nusually faster to fly from Los Angeles to London than to fly in the opposite direction?\nPolar High Pressure Zone: These are zones of very cold, very dry air descending at the\nNorth and South Poles. The descending air precludes the presence of clouds at the poles,\nin essence making these areas very cold deserts.\nThe air that descends from the Polar High and Sub-Tropical High pressure belts moves\nacross the earth surface towards the low pressure belts, feeling the bending effect of the\nCoriolis Force along the way. We are able to recognize six global wind belts located\nbetween the pressure belts as follows:\nNortheast Trade Winds: The air that sinks at the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s Sub-Tropical\nHigh Pressure Zone diverges in all directions once it nears the earth\u2019s surface. The\nportion of this air flow which moves south, towards the equator, is bent slightly to the\nright by the Coriolis Force (remember that this force is not very strong near the equator).\nThis slight bending effect results in a steady flow of warm wind blowing from the\nnortheast between approximately 30\u00b0N and the equator.\nSoutheast Trade Winds: These winds are the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s trade wind,\nblowing from a southeast direction between 30\u00b0S and the equator. The Southeast Trades\nand the Northeast Trades converge at the equator, where the air rises in the Inter Tropical\nConvergence Zone.\nPrevailing Westerlies: The Prevailing Westerlies (or just Westerlies for short) are\nlocated in both hemispheres between approximately 30\u00b0N and 60\u00b0N and 30\u00b0S and 60\u00b0S.\nThey originate from air that descended in the STHPZ and then flowed poleward. The\nCoriolis Force is stronger in the mid-latitudes, so the poleward-moving air gets bent more\nthan in the tropics, resulting in a strong wind pattern coming from the west. The\nPrevailing Westerlies in the Northern Hemisphere explain many weather patterns\naffecting California, especially our winter storms which are pushed along by these winds.\n.\nPolar Easterlies: These wind belts are located between the Poles and 60 degress latitude\nin both hemispheres. They are formed when air sinking in the Polar Highs diverges in all\ndirections (equatorward). At high latitude the Coriolis Force exerts maximum influence,\nso the very cold, flowing air is bent so much that the resulting wind comes from the east\nand encircles the poles.\nHere\u2019s a link to help visualize the pattern of global wind and pressure belts.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HWHwp75aBZo\nLimitations of this Global Circulation Model\nWe need to keep in mind that this is a MODEL of how our global wind and pressure belts\nwork. The model is based upon the presumption that we live on an all-water planet,\nwhich of course we do not. Land surfaces, with their irregularities of mountains, valleys,\ntrees, buildings, etc., tend to slow winds down and interfere with the locations of high\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver and low pressure systems by heating up differentially from one place to another (a forest\nwould heat up more slowly than bare soil on a warm summer day). Also, the locations of\nhigh and low pressure cells changes as the sun\u2019s direct rays migrate between the Tropics\nthroughout the year. In general, the pressure zones shift slightly north during the\nNorthern Hemisphere summer, and slightly south during the Southern Hemisphere\nsummer. Take a look at these links and focus on what happens to the location of strong\nprecipitation at the ITCZ as well as the general movement of high and low pressure belts\nas the months progress through the year.\nhttp:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/products\/precip\/CWlink\/wayne\/preciploop.gif\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DHrapzHPCSA&feature=related\n(please note in this video a feature called a Rossby Wave; try to remember for Chapter 7)\nHow the Global Circulation Model Helps Explain LA Weather\nNow that you\u2019ve seen for yourself that the High and Low Pressure Zones of the General\nCirculation Model shift north and south with the seasons, let\u2019s explore how this shift\naffects Los Angeles. Los Angeles is located along the Pacific coast approximately 34\ndegrees north of the equator, close to the border of the Prevailing Westerly Winds and the\nSub-Tropical High Pressure Zone (STHPZ). During the winter months in a typical year,\nthe Prevailing Westerlies and STHPZ shift a few degrees south, bringing to Los Angeles\nthe occasional winter storms which travel within the Prevailing Westerlies. However, for\nthe past few years this model has not always behaved as expected. From 2011 to 2016 a\nlarge high pressure cell that some meteorologists called the \u201cRidiculously Resilient\nRidge\u201d remained off the coast of California throughout much of the winter. This high\npressure cell pushed many incoming storms to the north of California, bringing us\nsignificantly less winter precipitation than normal. Luckily, this high pressure ridge was\nnot as prevalent in the winter of 2016-17, allowing Southern California to receive average\nwinter rainfall for the first time in several years. For winter 2017-18 the Ridiculously\nResilient Ridge was back, and Southern California rainfall was significantly below\nnormal once again. (http:\/\/www.sanluisobispo.com\/news\/weather\/weather-\nwatch\/article198288524.html). If this pattern continues, we are going to need to find\nbetter ways to conserve and capture water.\nOur summer months are dominated by the Sub-Tropical High Pressure Zone. By July-\nAugust the wind and pressure belts have migrated north and Los Angeles comes under\nthe influence of the Sub Tropical High Pressure Belt. During these months LA is\ntypically under the influence of sinking, dry air, so there are few if any clouds present.\nWith a clear sky and a strong sun overhead for many hours of the day, it\u2019s no surprise we\nsee very hot temperatures during the midst of summer. Of further\nnote is that the summertime high pressure tends to trap air between\nthe ocean and the mountains for days or even weeks. As we burn\nfuel and release exhaust into the air from our local industries or as\nwe commute to school, work or to the beach, the sun converts the\nexhaust into a toxic smog which we all breathe in. The smog only\ndissipates once the high pressure system breaks down or moves out\nof the area.\nPhoto courtesy of California Air Resources Board\nhttp:\/\/www.aqmd.gov\/news1\/Archives\/History\/marchcov.html#The Arrival of Air Pollution\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver LOCAL WINDS\nThe previous section focused on global wind and pressure zones, but there are also\nhundreds of winds that affect only local areas of the planet. Some of these have great\nnames like the \u2018Sirocco\u2019 which blows between North Africa and Mediterranean Europe,\nthe \u2018Nor\u2019easter\u2019 of New England, and the \u2018Diablo\u2019 winds of San Francisco, CA. Check\nout this link for details on many local winds: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_local_winds.\nI\u2019ll go ahead and describe a few local winds below, as these are world-famous or have a\npotential to affect Southern California.\nMonsoons\nMonsoons are winds that reverse direction with the seasons, bringing summer rains and\nwinter drought. The summer wet monsoon brings heavy downpours of rain for weeks on\nend, as the winds blow from the ocean to the land during these months. The opposite is\ntrue in winter, where the dry monsoon blows cool, arid air from the land to the ocean.\nMonsoons occur in several places on earth, but the most famous are the monsoons of\nSouth Asia (India and neighbors).\nCheck out these four links:\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1Qtf7M1s__w (looks like a student project but OK)\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jN9Z0rn3W1g\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:The_South_Asian_Monsoon.gif#file\nhttp:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/products\/Global_Monsoons\/Asian_Monsoons\/Asian_Monsoons.shtml\nOther areas with monsoon winds include Southeast Asia, northern Australia, and West\nAfrica. Some would argue that the southwest USA and northern Mexico have a monsoon\n(named the North American Monsoon), but others would argue there is insufficient\nseasonal wind reversal to call this a true monsoon. This area does experience heavy\nconvective thunderstorms in the summer months as the desert Southwest heats the air and\npulls in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of California. The thunderstorms are\nlargely restricted to the Mojave, Sonora and Colorado Deserts, but they can reach as far\nas California\u2019s Peninsula Ranges, San Gabriel Mountains and San Bernardino Mountains.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver On a hot summer day we can even see the tops of these thunderstorm clouds from\nGlendale College\nTop of a Mojave Desert Thunderstorm cloud as seen from Glendale College, CA in early Sept. 2011\nPhoto Courtesy of Catherine Crawford\nSouthern California Winds\nLand heats up faster and to higher temperatures than water when both are exposed to\nsunlight. It\u2019s also true that land cools down faster and to much cooler temperatures than\nwater does once the sun has set. The main reasons for this are that:\n1. Water allows the sun's rays to penetrate deep into the ocean (up to 650 feet in\nideal conditions) so the energy from the sun is absorbed within this entire\nthickness of water. On the other hand land absorbs the sun\u2019s energy only at the\nvery surface, allowing the land surface to heat up much faster.\n2. Water\u2019s physical properties are such that it takes 1 calorie of energy to raise the\ntemperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. On average, it takes only\nabout 0.2 calories of energy to raise the temperature of 1 gram of soil or rock\nmaterial the same 1 degree Celsius. So it takes five times less energy to get the\nland surface to heat up compared to the ocean surface.\n3. If the water surface gets too hot it begins to mix (via convection) with cooler\nwater from below, thereby making the surface water more moderate in\ntemperature. Land surfaces are not able to convect, so very hot land surfaces\nremain hotter than water surfaces throughout the afternoon hours.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver This differential heating and cooling of water and land results in differences in air\npressure between the Pacific Ocean and Southern California\u2019s coastal cities, which in\nturn creates coastal breezes known as the Land Breeze and the Sea Breeze. A Sea\nBreeze comes from the sea\/ocean (or even very large lakes in some parts of the country)\nduring the daytime, when the coastal land surfaces have heated up significantly while the\nocean remains much cooler. The warm air above the land rises and pulls air in from the\nocean, resulting in strong, cool winds blowing from the ocean to the land. Sea Breezes\nare especially strong in mid- to late-afternoon.\nSea Breeze: The diagram shows a heated daytime land surface with associated Low Pressure (1), strong Sea Breeze\n(2), rising air above the land (3), upper-level divergence (4), upper-level return air flow (5), sinking of cool air (6) into\nHigh Pressure over the ocean (7), which completes the circulation cell and further promotes the sea Breeze (2).\nOnce the sun has set the land surface cools much faster than the ocean, so by the early\nmorning hours the land can actually be slightly cooler than the ocean surface. The\naccompanying pressure differential promotes air to gently rise over the ocean, creating a\nmild breeze from the land to the ocean known as a Land Breeze. Land Breezes are most\ncommon in the early morning hours because sunrise offers the best opportunity for the\nland to have cooled down below the temperature of the adjacent ocean.\nHere\u2019s a quick (slightly funky) link describing Sea Breezes and Land Breezes.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZQV72Yzmjyc\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Land Breeze: The diagram shows sinking air and High Pressure (1) over the land which promotes a mild Land\nBreeze (2) flowing from the land to the ocean during the night or early morning. At this time the ocean is warmer than\nthe land so Low Pressure over the ocean (4) results in rising air (3) which diverges at high altitude (5) to create upper-\nlevel return air flow (6). The air sinks (7) promoting the High Pressure (1) over the land surface.\nSanta Ana Winds\nSanta Ana winds are strong, dry, downslope winds that affect Southern California in late\nfall to early spring. These winds are formed when a High Pressure Cell stagnates in the\nGreat Basin (Nevada-Utah) with the resulting anticyclonic air flow being directed\ntowards Southern California by the area\u2019s mountain ranges. The winds heat up as they\ndescend in elevation towards sea level, and can reach speeds of over 70 miles per hour as\nthey squeeze through low mountain passes and canyons on their way to the coast. These\nexcessively dry winds can promote or magnify the intensity of wildfires, especially\nduring the fall when vegetation is already extremely dry.\nSanta Ana Winds: A High Pressure Cell in the Great Basin\nsends air in an outward clockwise spiral. Mountain ranges in the\nsouthwest USA direct the air flow towards Southern California.\nThe air warms adiabatically as it descends from the Great Basin\n(approx. 4,000\u2019 elev.) towards the coast, and wind speeds\naccelerate as they squeeze through mountain passes and canyons.\nFor these reasons Santa Ana Winds are a major contributor to\nSouthern California wildfires.\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Santa_ana_winds.jpg\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Santa Ana Winds generally blow from the northeast and enter the San Fernando Valley,\nSan Gabriel Valley, and Los Angeles Basin after crossing the nearby San Gabriel\nMountains. Wind speeds can exceed 70 miles per hour in some of the low-lying canyons\nand passes including the Newhall Pass (near Sylmar), the Cajon Pass (where Highway 15\ncuts through the pass separating the San Gabriel Mountains and the San Bernardino\nMountains) and Santa Ana Canyon above Pasadena, from where the winds\u2019 name is\nderived.\nBy the time the winds reach the Los Angeles area\u2019s coastline the relative humidity of the\nair can be below 10 percent, and during Santa Ana conditions it may well be hotter along\nthe coast than in the deserts. The influx of warm air to the coastline also means that the\naverage September temperatures for some coastal cities are almost as high as they are for\nAugust. The excessive wind, heat, and aridity brought by the Santa Ana winds creates a\nrecipe for extreme fire danger, with massive wildfires common throughout Southern\nCalifornia in late Fall each year.

However, before we discuss\natmospheric water we should familiarize ourselves with where all of the Earth\u2019s water is located.\nOceans account for 71% of the total world surface area\nLand accounts for 29% of the world\u2019s surface area\nStill, the total volume of water on earth represents a tiny fraction when compared to the total\nvolume of the earth\u2019s lithosphere ash shown in the United States Geological Survey (USGS)\nimage to the right. In the image, the size of each\nsphere represents the volume of the earth and the\nvolume of water (total water, liquid fresh water, and\nfreshwater lakes\/rivers)\nhttp:\/\/ga.water.usgs.gov\/edu\/waterdistribution.html.\nSo where exactly is earth\u2019s water to be found?\nAccording to the USGS, if we took 100% of earth\u2019s\nwater volume we would find that 96.5 % of the total\nwater supply is in our oceans. In essence we have just\none ocean called the World Ocean. For ease we split\nthis \u2018world ocean\u2019 into four distinct ocean basins as\nshown below.

H., 1996: Water resources. In Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather, ed. by S. H. Schneider,\nOxford University Press, New York, vol. 2, pp.817-823.\nPhases of Water\nThere are three phases of water on Earth: solid, liquid, and vapor (or gas). Water easily changes\nfrom one phase or another, and there are some specific terms we use to describe these phase\nchanges.\nThe transformation of water vapor to solid ice is called sublimation or deposition. This takes\nplace in the atmosphere as water vapor transforms into snow or hail. As the process occurs,\nlatent energy is released into the cloud.\nThe reciprocal process, where ice transforms directly into water vapor is called sublimation.\nThis process occurs in very dry, cold air which is exposed to the sun, especially in the polar\nregions. It\u2019s not possible to see water vapor, so you cannot see sublimation occur. However,\nyou\u2019d probably be able to see that over time the thickness of ice diminishes (from the surface on\ndown) when sublimation occurs. It takes a tremendous amount of solar energy to transform ice\ninto water vapor.\nThe transformation of liquid water into ice is called freezing, a process which releases latent heat\nenergy into the environment, especially on cold mornings and during the winter. The reciprocal\nprocess of transforming ice into liquid water is called melting. This is very common during the\nspring season, when sunlight and heat allow for the melting of winter snows.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Liquid water\u2019s transformation into water vapor is called evaporation, which requires large inputs\nof solar energy. This is most common at the interface between the atmosphere and the oceans.\nThe transformation of water vapor into liquid water is called condensation. This process occurs\nwhen clouds, fog, and dew are formed, releasing latent heat into the environment.\nWater is constantly moved within the hydrosphere, as well as between the four Geographic\nSpheres in what we call the Hydrologic Cycle. There\u2019s a great NASA website describing this\ncycle at http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/Water\/page2.php.\nDiagram from NASA: http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Features\/Water\/page2.php\nThe largest source of atmospheric moisture is via evaporation from the oceans and seas. The\ngreat majority of this moisture falls back to the surface of the oceans, but according to the US\nGeological Survey (http:\/\/ga.water.usgs.gov\/edu\/watercycleevaporation.html) about 10 percent\nof the water evaporated from the oceans advects (moves horizontally) from above the oceans\ntowards the land, where it falls as precipitation. The hydrologic cycle details this movement of\nearth\u2019s water, and includes the following elements:\n\u2022 Advection is the horizontal movement of air (wind)\n\u2022 Infiltration and Percolation are terms used to describe the movement of water as it seeps into the pores and\ncracks of both soil and rock material.\n\u2022 Ponding is the temporary storage of water during or after a storm\n\u2022 Evaporation is the change of phase of water from a liquid surface to a vapor (gas).\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver \u2022 Transpiration is when water is lost from trees\/plants and goes into the atmosphere.\n\u2022 Evapotranspiration is when water changes from liquid to vapor after being stored in Earth\u2019s land materials\n(i.e. trees, soil, and rocks). Note: Evapotranspiration includes transpiration\n\u2022 Condensation is the process where water vapor in a parcel of rising air cools to its Dew Point temperature\nand transforms into liquid water droplets. These droplets are held aloft by the rising air, creating a cloud.\n\u2022 Precipitation is when moisture FALLS through the atmosphere (rain is the most common form).\nThe following links do a nice job of visualizing this movement of water in the hydrologic cycle.\n1. http:\/\/pmm.nasa.gov\/education\/videos\/tour-water-cycle\n2. http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HvQPPXhvJ_Y&feature=results_main&playnext=1&list=PL2\n3C6F3C3DD7D79AE\n3. https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/hydro\nHUMIDITY (Moisture in the air)\nHave you ever complained how sticky the air feels on a hot summer afternoon? You probably\nhave if you\u2019ve spent any time in the tropics, or a summer on the eastern half of the USA. The\nstickiness of the air means that the air is already quite full of moisture, and it will have a difficult\ntime pulling moisture away from your skin once you sweat. Since the evaporation of sweat from\nyour skin is a natural way of cooling your skin down, not being able to do so means that you feel\nhotter and stickier when the air is already moist. The measure of the moisture contained in the\nair is termed Humidity. It can be measured in several different ways (Specific Humidity,\nAbsolute Humidity, etc.) but the one which makes most sense to our daily lives is the measure of\nRelative Humidity.\nRelative Humidity (RH) refers to how much moisture is actually in the air in relation to how\nmuch moisture the air can possibly hold\nThe formula RH = AMR x 100\/SMR puts this concept into mathematical terms.\nAMR is the Actual Mixing Ratio, defined as the amount of moisture actually in the air per unit\nvolume. The AMR will remain constant unless there is evaporation or condensation. In other\nwords, if you have 4 grams of moisture in the air, that won\u2019t change unless more water is\nevaporated into it, moisture is condensed out of it, or another air mass (wetter or drier) mixes\nwith it.\nSMR is the Saturation Mixing Ratio, which refers to the amount of moisture the air could hold\nif completely saturated.\nRelative Humidity is just a comparison of how much water vapor is actually in the air compared\nto how much water vapor the air could possibly hold. As an example, think of a car that has 8\ngallons of gas in it but can hold 16 gallons. How full is the gas tank? The solution is 8\/16 x 100\n= 50%, meaning the gas tank is holding half the amount it can possibly hold. Instead of a car\u2019s\ngas tank, think of an air mass which actually contains 8 units of water vapor but could hold 16\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver units if completely saturated. In this case, the \u201crelative humidity\u201d would be 50% since the air is\nholding half the amount of water vapor it could possibly hold.\nThe only difference is that, unlike a car\u2019s gas tank, air\u2019s ability to hold water vapor (SMR)\nincreases as temperature increases. This makes sense if you think about it, because as air warms\nup the molecules move further apart, creating more room for other gases, especially water vapor.\nThis relationship between SMR and temperature is made evident by the following graph which\nshows that SMR increases as temperature rises (warmer air has the ability to hold more moisture\nsince warming air expands and provides more room for water vapor to be present).\nTemperature & SMR\nSMR\nTemperature\nThe graph also points out that as air cools down its ability to hold water vapor decreases. The\nimplication of this is that any air containing water vapor can be cooled down to the point that it\ncan no longer hold the water vapor, which gets \u2018kicked out\u2019 and transformed into either a liquid\n(through condensation) or a solid (through deposition).\nThe fastest way to cool air down naturally is to have it rise into the atmosphere. As the air cools\nits AMR stays constant, while the SMR continually decreases. At some critical point, the SMR\nwill have decreased to the point where the amount of water vapor the air can possibly hold is\nequal to the amount of water vapor actually in the air. When this occurs it means the Relative\nHumidity has reached 100%, and with the air completely saturated with water vapor several\nthings occur all at once:\n1. AMR = SMR\n2. Relative Humidity = 100%\n3. Dew Point Temperature has been reached (temperature required for saturation)\n4. Lifting Condensation Level (LCL) has been reached (elevation required for saturation)\n5. CONDENSATION BEGINS\u2026and clouds begin to form\nThe main ways to get air to rise into the atmosphere and cool enough to form clouds are:\n\u2022 Convective Uplift, the rising of warm surface air due to thermal properties.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver \u2022 Convergent Uplift, wind currents of similar temperature colliding and forcing air\nupwards.\n\u2022 Orographic Uplift, where the air is forced over a mountain or hill.\n\u2022 Frontal Uplift, as warm air comes in contact with a cold air mass and is forced upwards.\nSTEPS TO PRECIPITATION\nThe following steps are required in order for clouds to form and precipitation to occur from\nrising air.\n1. Dirty, moist air. In order for precipitation to occur we must begin with air containing both\nmoisture and small dust particles called hygroscopic nuclei or condensation nuclei.\n2. Rising and cooling: The air must then rise and cool.\n3. Condensation: Once the air has cooled to its Dew Point Temperature, the air is saturated,\nRH is 100%, LCL has been reached, and clouds begin to form as the condenses from a vapor to\nsmall liquid droplets.\n4. Droplet Growth: The air continues to rise, forming more droplets which coalesce (bump and\njoin together) to form larger drops of water.\n5. Precipitation: Finally the drops get so large they can no longer be kept afloat by the rising air,\nand they begin to fall to earth. The moisture falling down through the atmosphere is called\nprecipitation, which comes in 5 main varieties.\nTYPES OF PRECIPITATION\nThere are many forms of precipitation encountered in the atmosphere. We can define these\ndifferent types of precipitation by the average size of the water drops, as when we differentiate\nrain from drizzle, and we can further differentiate types of precipitation based on whether they\nare comprised of liquid water, solid ice, or a combination of both. The following represent the\nmost common forms of precipitation:\nRain\nLiquid precipitation with an average diameter greater\nthan 0.5mm is referred to as rain. Rain is the most\ncommon form of precipitation and is especially\nprevalent near the equator. Since rain drops can be\nquite large and thus they can fall at considerable speed,\nthey tend to have an aerodynamic tear-drop shape.\nWinter rain which falls through the atmosphere with a\nfreezing layer just above the ground tends to instantly\nfreeze the rain, producing a treacherous frozen rain.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Drizzle\nDrizzle is basically small rain, as this form of precipitation is defined as\n\u201cliquid precipitation with an average diameter less than or equal to\n0.5mm.\u201d Since drizzle is so small the droplets don\u2019t fall very fast\nthrough the atmosphere, so they tend to take on a more spherical shape.\nDrizzle is very common in the early morning hours, especially in the\ntropics and mid-latitude coasts. Very small drizzle is called mist.\nSnow\nSnow is solid precipitation which formed from deposition of\nwater vapor directly into ice crystals within a very cold cloud.\nSnow is most common at high altitude and high latitude,\nespecially during the cold winter months. Though there are\nmultiple varieties of snow based on the temperature of the air\nwhen it formed, each and every crystal of snow has a\nhexagonal (6-sided) shape.\nSleet\nIf falling snowflakes encounter a layer of warm air during their\ndescent, the snow will partially melt and reach the surface as\npellets composed of both ice and water (slush) called sleet.\nSleet is most common during winter in the mid-latitudes.\nHail\nThe National Weather Service defines hail as \u201cShowery\nprecipitation in the form of irregular pellets or balls of ice more\nthan 5 mm in diameter, falling from a cumulonimbus cloud\u201d.\nThe irregular pellets have a concentric pattern, formed from\nmultiple cycles of growth as the ice is repeatedly lifted and\nforced downwards within the cumulonimbus cloud. Each time a\nhail stone is carried higher by the updraft it grows in size as it\ncollides with supercooled raindrops or other pieces of hail. The\nhailstone then falls downwards and either exits the cloud or is pulled back upwards again by the\nstrong updraft within the cloud. When the updraft can no longer lift the falling hailstone back for\nanother cycle, it falls to the earth as hail.\nThe stronger the updraft, the larger the hailstones produced.\nThough the minimum size is 5mm (0.2-inch) in diameter it is not\nunusual for hail to exceed one inch in diameter, and the record\ndiameter for hail is 8.0 inches! Updraft speeds within a hail cloud\nmust exceed 100mph to form softball-size hail, so this enormous\nhail must fall to earth at an even faster speed. A description of\nhail-related hazards (including fatal grapefruit-size hail), can be\nfound at https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/hail.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver The World Record size for a confirmed hailstone\nis 8 inches which fell during a severe thunderstorm\nin the town of Vivian, South Dakota on July 23,\n2010. The hailstone weighed just less than two\npounds and had a circumference of 18.62 inches.\nhttps:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/5rhd1coDR?url=http:\/\/www.crh.noaa.gov\/abr\/?n=stormdamagetemplate\nThe most common place in the world to observe large hail is in the Great Plains and Rocky\nMountain states of the USA. In these locations, especially in the months of spring and early\nsummer, cold arctic air moving south can readily collide with warm tropical air moving north,\ncreating ideal conditions for thunder storm development and hail formation. The darker green\nareas on this NOAA map indicate areas that reported large hail at least 10 days per year for 2003\nthrough 2012. The areas reporting the most are in the central and southern Great Plains states.\nhttp:\/\/www.spc.noaa.gov\/wcm\/2013\/HAIL.png\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver So Where Does Most Precipitation Occur in The World?\nNow that you\u2019re familiar with the types of precipitation, we should take a quick look at where\nthis precipitation falls across the planet. In the diagram below, the darker blue colors indicate\nhigher amounts of annual precipitation, while the lighter blue tones indicate drier annual\nconditions. It becomes quite clear that the dark blue areas, representing higher annual rainfall,\nare found near the equator (black line) as well as along mid-latitude coastlines.\nMAP of GLOBAL PRECIPITATION https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:World_precip_annual.png\nThinking back to Chapter 5, you might connect the areas of heavy precipitation near the equator\nwith the location of the ITCZ. Does this make sense to you? Take a couple of minutes to think\nabout this, and then check out the following NASA link and click the play button.\nhttp:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/GlobalMaps\/view.php?d1=TRMM_3B43M#\nCan you see that the area of heavy rainfall near the equator (dark blue color) seems to move in a\nnorth-south pattern throughout the year? During which month does this rainfall reach furthest\nnorth? When does it reach furthest south? Reflecting back to Chapter 1, does this follow the\npattern for the annual migration of the sun\u2019s direct (vertical) ray?\nLook at the Global Precipitation map once more. Do you notice the areas of light blue color,\nrepresenting dry annual conditions, are located in places like North Africa, the Arabian\nPeninsula, and central Australia. Which global pressure belt of sinking air do you think matches\nup with these areas?\nIn Chapter 8 we\u2019ll explore these questions in greater detail, but it\u2019s a good idea to identify the\nconnections between topics and chapters whenever possible.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Where Do We Get Most Precipitation in the Contiguous 48 States of the USA?\nhttp:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/products\/analysis_monitoring\/regional_monitoring\/us_12-month_precip.shtml\nThis color map shows the annual rainfall throughout the continental USA for a typical year\n(2010). According to the map, when we don\u2019t include Alaska or Hawaii, where are the wettest\nregions of the USA? Notice how annual precipitation decreases rapidly when you move\neastward from the Pacific Northwest (WA, OR) but takes many hundreds of miles to decrease as\nyou move westward from the Atlantic states. Can you provide any reasonable explanations for\nthis?\nAny Recent Rainfall Near You?\nCheck out https:\/\/www.cnrfc.noaa.gov\/ol.php and see who received most rain near you in the\npast 24 hours (click on the 24-hour box on the right side of the web page then zoom in to your\narea). If there was any precipitation in your area, can you account for why some places received\nmore precipitation than others?\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver CLOUD CLASSIFICATION\nClouds are divided into three main Cloud Levels (called \u00e9tages) based on their base elevation.\nThese cloud levels include:\n\u2022 High Clouds. These are the highest of clouds, formed entirely of ice crystals as they are\nfound towards the top of the troposphere. They are typically thin and wispy in\nappearance, as the upper-level winds disperse their moisture across the sky. Individual\nforms include Cirrus (Ci), Cirrocumulus (Cc), and Cirrostratus (Cs) clouds.\n\u2022 Middle Clouds. These clouds are typically found between 6,500 and 25,000 feet high.\nAt these elevations they are composed mostly of liquid water droplets, with some ice\nforming at elevations cold enough to freeze the water. Individual forms include\nAltocumulus (Ac), Altostratus (As), and Nimbostratus (Ns) clouds.\n\u2022 Low Clouds. Found at elevations ranging from the surface to 6,500 feet, Low Clouds\nare composed mostly of water droplets. Individual forms include Cumulus (Cu),\nStratocumulus (Sc), Stratus (St), and Cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds, though the latter\n(Cb) clouds can grow vertically to great heights.\nThe specific height of each \u00e9tage varies by season, with each of the cloud levels extending to\ngreater elevations during the summer when compared to winter, and with greater heights in the\ntropics when compared to the poles. The following diagram clearly shows the latitudinal\ncomponent of this. Source: https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/corefour\nLevel Polar Region Temperate Region Tropical Region\nHigh Clouds 10,000-25,000 feet (3-8 km) 16,500-40,000 Feet (5-13 km) 20,000-60,000 feet (6-18 km)\nMiddle Clouds 6,500-13,000 feet (2-4 km) 6,500-23,000 feet (2-7 km) 6,500-25,000 feet (2-8 km)\nLow Clouds Surface-6,500 feet (0-2 km) Surface-6,500 feet (0-2 km) Surface-6,500 feet (0-2 km)\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Cloud Forms\nIn addition to cloud levels, clouds are divided into four main forms based on their shape or\nwhether they are producing precipitation or not. The following descriptions of the four main\ncloud forms are from the National Weather Service (NWS).\n(https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/corefour)\nCirro-form clouds are high-level clouds composed of ice crystals. They are\ntypically thin and white in appearance but can create an array of colors at\nCirro-form sunrise and sunset. Cirrus generally occur in fair weather.\nNimbo-form clouds produce steady precipitation. As the clouds thicken and\nprecipitation begins to fall, the bases of the clouds tend to lower toward the\nground. The dark gray color is from sunlight being reflected from the top and\nsides of the cloud by water droplets and ice, which produces a dark shadow.\nNimbo-form\nCumulo-form clouds are \u2018heaped\u2019 so they look like fluffy white cotton balls\nwith a flat base. This heaped nature tells us that the air is unstable and wants to\ncontinue to rise. The height of the cloud base depends upon the moisture\ncontent of the rising air, with higher moisture content linked to lower cloud\nbase. The total height of the cloud depends on the temperature of the rising air\ncompared to that of the surrounding air.\nCumulo-form\nStrato-form clouds are layered horizontally so as to cover the sky with a dull\nblanket of gray weather. These are usually low-level clouds and are considered\nto be \u2018stable\u2019, meaning they do not want to rise into the atmosphere unless\nStrato-form\nforced to do so. If these cloud forms touch the ground, even on hills or\nmountains, they may then be called fog.\nMAJOR CLOUD TYPES\nUsing the groupings of clouds based on elevation (\u00e9tages) and cloud form we can now explore\nthe main types of clouds identified by the National Weather Service\u2019s Cloud Chart, which can be\nfound towards the bottom of this link: https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/cloudchart. The chart\ndivides 27 major cloud types into three rows based on cloud height (high, middle, and low\n\u00e9tage). An additional 5 \u2018special case\u2019 cloud types are shown on a fourth row at the bottom of the\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver chart, including tornadoes and wave clouds. Click on a few of the cloud forms so that you can\nsee different examples of how they appear in the atmosphere.\nAlso check out this video link http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ur0k7UDrrvg&feature=related to\nhelp you identify some basic cloud types.\nTwenty seven cloud types, is a lot to remember, so the National Weather Service has identified\nwhat it considers to be the \u201cTen Basic Clouds\u201d. These can be found on the on the NWS page\nhttps:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/basicten\nSince this is a Physical Geography course and not a Weather course, we\u2019ll focus on a select few\nof these individual cloud types. Make sure you can identify and describe the cloud types listed\nbelow in bold letters, based mainly on their height and their form.\nNational Weather Service \u201cBasic Ten\u201d Cloud Chart. https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/basicten\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Cirrus: Very high clouds made of ice. The fast winds disperse the ice to give the appearance of\na horse\u2019s tail.\nStratus are low, horizontally layered clouds that make everything look gray. They are\nsometimes associated with light mist and drizzle, but not heavy rainfall.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Cumulus clouds are puffy and white on top with flat, gray bottoms. They grow vertically.\nNimbostratus clouds are dark gray, low altitude clouds that produce rain and drizzle.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Cumulonimbus: Massive clouds that grow vertically. They usually have flat gray bottom with\nwhite sides and are associated with violent rain, hail, thunder, and lightning.\nIt is important to remember that clouds are continually on the move, and some can morph from\none type to the other quite readily. Stratus clouds can be forced upwards into the atmosphere,\nbecoming Nimbostratus. Cumulus clouds can bunch together, becoming Cumulus Congestus,\nand if they continue to grow vertically along an updraft they can develop into a mature\nCumulonimbus cloud (with strong updrafts and downdrafts within the same cloud). It is the\nfriction between ice crystals, water, and air moving in opposite directions in the updrafts and\ndowndrafts which allows electrons to be \u2018chipped\u2019 away from molecules, leaving parts of the\ncloud with opposing electrical charges. The uneven electrical charge found during the mature\nstage of cumulonimbus cloud formation can result in lightning and thunder. Later, the cloud\ndissipates as the updrafts are no longer present and the cloud is dominated by downdrafts. We\u2019ll\nexplore this in greater depth in the next chapter on Air Masses and Storms.\nCheck out this link as cumulus clouds develop into cumulonimbus:\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NiCSk1zxMEs\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver DEW, FROST and FOG\nIt is also possible for condensation to occur without the air rising and cooling. In fact, this is\nhow both fog and dew are created, and we can add frost to the list if we include the deposition\nof ice. Let\u2019s explore each of these:\nDew\nDew is defined as condensation of liquid droplets onto cold surfaces. In nature, it is most\ncommon at the end of a long, cold, calm clear winter night. It forms on objects like glass\nwindows, metal gates, and car bodies because these objects radiate heat energy very effectively,\nso on long winter nights they cool faster and further than the air temperature does. In the early\nmorning hours they may be the coldest objects around, and if moist air comes into contact with\nthem, the moisture condenses onto the cold object. You can see the same thing happen in the\nmiddle of a summer afternoon if you have a cold glass of ice-water. Leave the cold glass out\nfor a few minutes and you\u2019ll notice the glass gets wet on the\noutside. It\u2019s not that your glass is leaking\u2026this is dew forming on\nthe outside of the glass! Dew can be experienced in many places\nthroughout the world, wherever atmospheric moisture and cold\ntemperatures can be found together. Sometimes it gets so cold in\nthe morning that the dew, once formed, begins to freeze. The\nproduct is called frozen dew, and appears as icy bumps on\nfreezing cold objects. In this case, condensation occurred first and\nthen the condensed water froze later on.\nPhoto of Morning Dew\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:TauTropfenGerbera1.JPG\nFrost\nAir with a dew point temperature which is lower than 32\u00baF, and\nwhich comes into contact with very cold objects (also below 32\u00baF\nor 0\u00baC) can deposit a fine layer of ice onto the very cold object.\nThis fine layer of ice is called frost, and forms directly from air to\nice. It is most common on cold, clear, winter nights, especially at\nhigh elevation and high latitude. Photo of morning frost on vegetation by\nEmmanuel Boutet https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frost#\/media\/File:Feuilles-avec-glace-\nleaves-with-ice-1.jpg\nFog\nCondensation of the air layer located just above the ground\nsurface is called fog. Fog can range in height from a few inches\nto several hundred feet above the ground. Fog can exist as a very\nthin veil of moisture (sometimes called mist) or as a thick body of\nsuspended droplets making it difficult to see (this would be a\nclassic fog). It is basically a cloud at ground-level, but unlike a\ncloud, fog does not form as a result of air rising. Fog forms\nmainly on long, cold, winter nights when the ground surface cools the overlying air to below its\ndew point temperature. This is sometimes aided by extra moisture evaporated into the air above\nwater surfaces. Evaporation Fog (photo courtesy of NOAA)\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver There are many types of fog, including radiation fog, evaporation fog, advection fog and\nupslope fog, all of which are composed of small suspended drops of liquid water.\nAdvection Fog in San Francisco (NOAA)\nFor a detailed description of the types of fog check out http:\/\/www.nws.noaa.gov\/om\/fog\/.\nHere\u2019s a description of a few major types of fog.\nRadiation Fog\nRadiation fog forms after a long, cold, clear,\ncalm night when so much heat has radiated away\nfrom the ground surface the air immediately\nabove the ground chills to it dew point\ntemperature. The thickness of Radiation Fog\nvaries from a few feet to over 1,000 feet,\ngradually thickening as temperatures continue to\nfall. Radiation fog tends to form mostly in\nvalleys as cold air tends to sink there, and this\nfog doesn\u2019t tend to move far once formed. In the\nwinter Radiation Fog can form very quickly,\ncausing deadly pile-ups on California\u2019s Central Valley freeways in the early pre-dawn hours.\nOnce the sun comes up and warms the ground surface, radiation fog quickly dissipates.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Frozen Fog\nA specialized type of fog composed largely of ice\ncrystals rather than water droplets is known as Frozen\nFog or Ice Fog. Ice Fog forms only when the air\ntemperature near the ground surface is well below\nfreezing. The presence of \"supercooled\" water\ndroplets may create problems as these droplets remain\nin the liquid state until they come into contact with a\nsolid surface, upon which they freeze, coating the\nobject in ice.\nAdvection Fog\nAdvection fog is caused by the horizontal movement\nof warm, moist air over a cold surface (land or\nocean). Once formed, this fog moves horizontally\nalong the ground. A classic example is the warm,\nmoist air of the Pacific Ocean moving towards the\nCalifornia coastline. Before reaching the coast, this\nair is chilled by the cold surface waters of the\nCalifornia Current. During winter and spring nights\nthe waters of this current can be so cold they chill the\nPacific air to below its dew point temperature,\nthereby forming a fog. This fog then creeps onto the\ncoast, pushing further inland in the pre-dawn hours.\nBy sunrise, the fog layer has thickened and moved (horizontally) many miles inland. After the\nsun rises, it may take hours for this Advection Fog to evaporate into the air, or it might rise\nabove the ground to form a low stratus cloud. Point Reyes Sea Shore in Northern California has\nover 200 foggy days per year! Take a look at the following link for a discussion of this type of\nfog and its link to California\u2019s Marine Layer. https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/marine\nUpslope Fog\nUpslope fog forms when light winds push moist\nair high enough into a cold hill or mountain that the\nair reaches its dew point temperature and condenses.\nUpslope fog is common in California\u2019s mountain\nregions during the winter and spring when cold\nmountain temperatures chill moist air coming from\nthe Pacific Ocean.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Evaporation Fog\nFog forming over a water body such as a lake or river is\nreferred to as Evaporation Fog. This forms most often\nwhen the water body has evaporated moisture into the\nair during a long, cold, calm night. The higher moisture\ncontent of the air sitting above the lake or river means\nthis air doesn\u2019t have to cool as much in order to reach its\ndew point temperature. With overnight cooling, an\nEvaporation Fog forms only over the water (and\nimmediately next to it) whereas the surrounding land\nremains fog-free. The formation of this fog is helped if\nthe water temperature is much warmer than that of the air.\nTake a look at the following links for more details on fog.\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fog\nMy favorite hail Clip: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wZr8jXo1Uso\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Storms\nWe\u2019ve all experienced storms, but understanding how they work is beyond most of us.\nThere are various types of storms found over the planet, so this chapter sets out to\nuncover the geographic distribution of storm types, how they form, how they are\nstructured, and how they end. We\u2019ll look at mid-latitude winter storms, tornados,\nhurricanes, and thunderstorms, as well as longer-term weather patterns that influence the\nfrequency of storms, such as El Ni\u00f1o - Southern Oscillation. In order to begin, we must\nrealize that many storms form when different air masses mix together, so let\u2019s first\nexplore the nature of these air masses.\nAir mass: An air mass is a large parcel of air which sits still over an area for days or\nweeks, by which time the entire parcel has taken on the temperature and moisture\ncharacteristics of the underlying surface. If the underlying surface is an ocean (a\nmaritime air mass), the air will tend to be moist, whereas dry air masses tend to form over\nland (continental) surfaces that are far from a coastline. If the air mass is located at high\nlatitude (Polar) it will tend to be cold, whereas if located towards the equator (Tropical) it\nwill tend to be warmer in temperature.\nwww.srh.noaa.gov\/crp\/?n=education-airmasses\nSource regions are areas over which air masses form.\nAir masses are represented on weather maps by using one or more of the following letter\ndesignations:\nc = continental\nm = maritime\nT = Tropical\nP = Polar\nA = Arctic\nE = Equatorial\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Main Air Mass Types for North America\nmP: Maritime Polar. These cold and very moist air masses form over the polar oceans\nand seas. The air cannot get too cold because they form over the oceans, and they are not\nconsidered to be excessively wet air masses because cold air cannot hold very much\nmoisture. For North America we see these air masses form in the Gulf of Alaska and in\nthe Labrador Sea off the northeast coast of Canada. They can migrate into the mid-\nlatitudes most any time of year but this is most common during the winter months.\ncP: Continental Polar. These very cold and very dry air masses form in Central Canada\nduring the height of winter. These air masses sneak into the mid-latitudes during the\nwinter and spring months, bringing bone-chilling temperatures and storm activity with\nthem. Except for on very rare occasions, the Rocky Mountains and Prevailing Westerly\nwinds tend to keep these very cold air masses away from California.\nA: Arctic. These super cold and extra dry air masses form in northern Canada during the\nwinter, and tend to stay within the Arctic. Even though these air masses form over the\nfrozen Arctic Ocean, the icy surface of the ocean acts just like land, giving up very little\nmoisture to the dry air immediately above.\nmT: Maritime Tropical. These are very warm, wet air masses which form over the\nCaribbean Sea and in the tropical Pacific. The warm air can hold lots of water, and when\nthese air masses migrate into the mid-latitudes they provide the moisture source for many\nof our storms.\ncT: Continental Tropical. These are hot and dry air masses which form during the\nsummer months along the northern border of Mexico (Sonora and Chihuahua) and the\nUSA\u2019s southwest states of New Mexico and Arizona. There is sufficient distance from\nthe coast for these air masses to become very dry and very hot during the long summer\nmonths. When these air masses begin to migrate they can bring hot, dry conditions to\nColorado, Texas and beyond.\nhttp:\/\/ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu\/(Gh)\/wwhlpr\/air_masses.rxml?hret=\/guides\/mtr\/af\/frnts\/cfrnt\/cyc.rxml\nhttp:\/\/ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu\/(Gh)\/wwhlpr\/tropical_airmass_def.rxml?hret=\/guides\/mtr\/af\/frnts\/cfrnt\/cyc.r\nxml&prv=1\nSo air masses form in specific areas where the air can sit still for weeks. This also means\nthat air masses tend not to form in areas with constant wind motion such as in the\nWesterly winds of the mid-latitudes. However, once air masses have formed, they do not\ntend to stay still forever. In fact, it is the mixing of different air masses that creates our\ntypical mid-latitude winter storms. So what makes the different air masses move away\nfrom their source regions, allowing us to have winter storms? It\u2019s the Rossby Waves!\nRossby Waves\nRossby Waves are big bends in the Polar Jet Stream, that river of air found\napproximately 30-40,000 feet high in the troposphere, typically around 60\u00baN and 60\u00baS\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Latitude. Rossby Waves are mild (flat) and located closer to the poles in the summer, but\nthey are extreme and located more equatorward in the winter.\nhttps:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/jet and http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?NR=1&v=CgMWwx7Cll4\nAs the Polar Jet Stream tends to provide a border between very cold air on the pole-ward\nside, and warmer air on the equator-ward side, once Rossby Waves form in the midst of\nwinter, they allow cold polar air to be pulled equator-ward while at the same time they\nallow warm tropical air to be forced towards the poles.\nIn the midst of winter we find the mid-latitudes with parcels of cold, polar air sitting next\nto parcels of warm tropical air, both parcels separated by a bend in the Polar Jet Stream, a\nRossby Wave. Recall also, that the surface winds of the mid-latitudes are the Prevailing\nWesterly winds, which will now push both the cold air and warm air parcels off to the\neast\u2026thus begins the path of our winter storms, known formally as Mid-Latitude Wave\nCyclones.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Mid- Latitude Wave Cyclones\nCheck out http:\/\/www.srh.noaa.gov\/crp\/?n=education-airmasses and http:\/\/www.aos.wisc.edu\/~aalopez\/aos101\/wk13.html\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Occluded_cyclone.svg http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyclogenesis\nFor the west coast of the USA, strong Rossby waves lead to the formation of our typical\nwinter storms, the classic Mid-Latitude Wave Cyclone. These winter storms are usually\ncomprised of three main segments: Low Pressure Center, Cold Front and Warm Front.\nhttp:\/\/ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu\/(Gh)\/wwhlpr\/air_masses.rxml?hret=\/guides\/mtr\/af\/frnts\/cfrnt\/cyc.rxml\nEach of these segments will be pushed to the east by the Prevailing Westerly Winds, but\nthe Cold front will move faster than the other two segments due to the higher density of\nthe cold air. The faster motion of the Cold Front means that the warm air between the\nCold Front and Warm Front will ultimately get \u201csqueezed\u201d up into the atmosphere.\nThe Low Pressure Center generally occurs at the crest of a Rossby Wave, where the\nbends in the Polar Jet Stream have allowed for circular rotation of warm and cold air\nparcels.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver A cold front marks the border of cold air moving into warm air, and is represented using\ntriangles. http:\/\/ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu\/(Gh)\/guides\/mtr\/af\/frnts\/cfrnt\/prcp.rxml\nA warm front marks the border of warm air moving into cooler air, and is represented by\nsemi-circles.\nUplift, and therefore rain, is associated with all three segments of this storm. The Low\nPressure Center is an area of general atmospheric uplift, but warm air is also being\nuplifted along both fronts. Along the Cold Front, cold air moves in quickly to wedge the\nwarm air aloft. This type of front has a steep angle, so the warm air rises quickly,\ncondenses, and yields heavy rainfall. On the other hand, Warm Fronts have a much\nlower angle for the uplift to take place along, so the warm air rises gently over the cool\nair, and the rainfall is lighter in nature and located well in advance of the Warm Front\u2019s\nlocation at ground level.\nhttp:\/\/ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu\/(Gh)\/wwhlpr\/warm_front_precip.rxml?hret=\/guides\/mtr\/af\n\/frnts\/cfrnt\/prcp.rxml\nWhen the Cold Front catches up to the Warm Front, the warm air has effectively been\nlifted off the ground, and the term Occluded Front is used to describe this condition.\nOcclusion usually occurs at the Low Pressure center first and then progresses equator-\nward (south in the Northern Hemisphere) like a zipper being pulled. With the warm air\nalready lifted off the ground, the storm\u2019s energy has been largely dissipated and the storm\nsoon fades out. The typical Low Pressure Center, and thus the storm in general, moves at\na speed of approximately 20 to 40 mph from west to east. The Cold Front moves slightly\nfaster and the Warm Front moves a little slower. Since the Cold Front moves fastest it\nwill ultimately catch up to the Warm Front, resulting in an Occluded Front, which is\nshown on a weather map as a line with both triangles and semi-circles pointing in the\ndirection of frontal movement. Occlusion represents the dying days of a storm, as the\nwarm air has all been pushed high into the troposphere.\nIn a very general sense, Mid-Latitude Wave Cyclones tend to deliver more precipitation\nto the higher mid-latitudes (45-60 degrees of latitude) and to the coastlines. The lower\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver mid-latitudes (30-45\u02da) tend to receive less moisture as they are located further from the\nwinter\u2019s Low Pressure Centers, while inland locations tend also to receive less moisture\nthan the coastlines. However, storm tracks and mountains such as the Cascade Ranges,\nSierra Nevada and Rockies have an enormous impact on the distribution of these storms.\nFor a quick review click http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=endscreen&v=Tr9vMb44TZc&NR=1\nTORNADOES\nMake sure to check out these awesome links\nhttp:\/\/www.spc.noaa.gov\/faq\/tornado http:\/\/www.srh.noaa.gov\/crp\/?n=education-tornadoes\nhttp:\/\/www.nssl.noaa.gov\/education\/svrwx101\/tornadoes\/faq https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/tornado\nA Tornado is defined as a funnel shaped, rotating column of air emanating from a\ncumulonimbus cloud and in contact with the ground. This differs slightly from a funnel\ncloud, which does not show ground contact. Tornadoes and Funnel Clouds are associated\nwith heavy rain, strong winds, hail, lightning and thunder.\nThe diameter of a tornado is typically 100 to 600 feet, but ground disturbance has\nindicated a size as small as 7 feet and as wide as 2.5 miles. Rotational wind speeds are\ntypically less than 110mph, but speeds over 300mph have been recorded. Tornadoes\ntypically travel across the land at between 20 and 40mph, and take a path determined by\nthe direction of the cloud it\u2019s attached to. They typically last anywhere from a few\nseconds to several hours, but the average is approximately 10 minutes, cutting a path of\ndestruction approximately 5 miles in length. Tornadoes were once responsible for\nhundreds of deaths per year, but recent advances in atmospheric research and technology\nmeans that this number is down to about 60 deaths per year in the USA.\nTornado Damage Scale: http:\/\/www.ouramazingplanet.com\/tornado-damage-scale-image-110425-1435\/1\/\nTornado Formation\nMost strong tornadoes form from an area of localized rotation (sometimes referred to as a\nTight Circulation or Mesocyclone) within a large variety of cumulonimbus cloud called a\nSupercell. The Mesocyclone forms when warm, surface-level winds move at a different\nspeed (or different direction) than cooler, higher-level winds, so that the air near the\nsurface begins to roll (see Diagram A) https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/tornado\n(A) (B)\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Once the rolling air is forced to lift upwards (Diagram B) the rolling motion creates mini\ncirculation patterns which rotate counterclockwise (the left side of Diagram B) and\nclockwise (the right side). For the Northern Hemisphere, the counterclockwise\ncomponent is amplified as rising air (an area of low atmospheric pressure) tends to\nnaturally rotate counterclockwise, while the clockwise rotating mini-circulation is\ncanceled out. Therefore, mesocyclones and most (but not all) tornadoes rotate counter-\nclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. The rising air within the mesocyclone condenses,\ndroplets grow, and ultimately produces rain and hail. In turn, the intense rainfall and hail\nemanating from the mesocyclone drag air downwards with it, getting faster and faster as\nthe precipitation approaches the ground. This downdraft draws an edge of the\nmesocyclone downward, and as it approaches the ground a visible condensation funnel\nappears. This funnel cloud becomes a tornado once ground disturbance takes place. The\ntornado feeds upon a steady supply of warm air being drawn upwards, and will continue\nto exist as long as this supply is available.\nTornado Frequency and US Distribution\nAbout 1,000 tornadoes occur in the United States each year, and almost every state\nexperiences tornadoes as shown in the following map.\nhttps:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/tornado\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver This map (below) reiterates that the frequency of tornadoes in the USA is concentrated in\nthe area to the east of the Rocky Mountains, a region known as the Great Plains.\nIndeed, the true hotspot of tornado activity in the USA, and for that matter the world, is\nthe southern part of the Great Plains, centered in Oklahoma. The Southern Great Plains\nis thus nicknamed \"tornado alley.\"\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver The peak of tornado season for the entire USA occurs in late spring and early summer,\nwith a monthly peak in May.\nSource http:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/oa\/climate\/severeweather\/tornadoes.html\nHowever, this depends on location. The following graph clearly shows that the south-\nsoutheastern US states (Alabama and Arkansas, part of what some scientists refer to as\n\u201cDixie Alley\u201d) experience their peak tornado seasons in early spring. The southern Great\nPlains state of Oklahoma and the more northerly states of Kansas, Ohio and Illinois in\nmid- to late-spring, and South Dakota, the most northerly of those listed, in latest spring\nto early summer.\nhttp:\/\/www.nssl.noaa.gov\/users\/brooks\/public_html\/tornado\/#alltorn\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Alabama and Arkansas, and to a point Oklahoma, appear to have a minor secondary peak\nin latest Fall, possibly due to the insertion of tropical moisture at the tail end of the\nCaribbean hurricane season. Illinois\u2019 peak appears to be a bit early for this synopsis to\nfit perfectly, but latitude is not the only factor to consider here, and where most peaks on\nthe graph dive quickly, the graph for Illinois does not do so, indicating that tornado\npotential is still strong throughout spring.\nThough not graphed here, even states like California or New York are subjected to\ntornadoes, which are usually associated with strong cumulonimbus cloud cells within\nwinter storms. These tornadoes tend to be much less frequent and much weaker than\nthose of the southern Great Plains.\nGlobal Tornadoes\nAccording to the NOAA, the most favorable locations for tornadoes to form are the mid-\nlatitudes, between 30 and 50 degrees from the equator, where cold polar air can collide\nwith warm, moist tropical air. Additionally, tropospheric winds at these latitudes tend to\nflow at different speeds and directions as you go up in altitude, which allows storm cells\nto rotate more easily. The USA is the global leader in tornado occurrence, recording over\n1,000 tornadoes each year on average. Canada is home to the second most tornadoes,\nrecording an average of approximately 100 per year. Tornadoes are also common in the\nmid-latitudes of Europe, western Asia, Japan, eastern China, Australia, New Zealand,\nSouth Africa and Argentina.\n(http:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/oa\/climate\/severeweather\/tornadoes.html).\nThough 80% or more of all tornadoes on the planet are found in the USA, the following\nmap shows that many other places do indeed experience them too!\nhttp:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/img\/climate\/research\/tornado\/globdist.jpg\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Hurricanes\nCheck out http:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/resource-collections\/hurricanes\nHurricanes are defined as organized storms of the tropics with\nsustained winds exceeding 74 mph. Tropical cyclones forming\nin the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific are called hurricanes, while in\nthe Western Pacific they are called typhoons, and in the Indian\nOcean they are called tropical cyclones.\nHurricanes are characterized by:\n- Sustained winds over 74 mph\n- Typical size of 100 to 600 miles in diameter\n- Northern Hemisphere hurricane season is from June to December\n- Form from 5\u00ba-25\u00ba N & S latitude. Over 80% form from 5-15\u00baN and 5-15\u00baS, but\nthey never form between 5\u00baN and 5\u00baS.\n- Hurricanes form over warm water, usually over 80\u00baF\n- Intense circulating low pressure, as low as 850mb\n- Lowest pressure, fastest wind speeds and most destruction found at the eye wall\n- Calm eye extends 10 to 25 miles in diameter at the center of the hurricane\n- Deadly storm surge as high as 25 feet found at the advancing eye wall\n- Typical track in the Northern Hemisphere is from the east before they track to the\nnorth to be caught up in the Westerly winds\n- Over 80% occur in September, August and October\n- 90% of hurricane-related deaths are by drowning\nHurricane Formation\nHurricanes all form from simple lines of tropical\nthunderstorms called \u201cEasterly Waves\u201d or \u201cTropical\nDisturbances\u201d which migrate east-to-west as they are\npushed by the Trade Winds. Wind speeds are below\n23mph. If an Easterly Wave stays over warm, tropical\nwaters it will continue to pull in warm, moist air, which\nallows the storm to grow in intensity as it becomes\nmore organized. Once wind speeds exceed 23mph, the\nstorm is called a Tropical Depression. At this stage the\nstorm is beginning to spin, which allows it to bring in\nmore moist air, which acts as the fuel for the storm as\nthe rising moist air releases latent heat once it\ncondenses into the clouds. If a Tropical Depression\nstays over warm water and its wind speeds exceed\n39mph, it has now become a Tropical Storm, and it is\ngiven an official name (see storm names below).\nAgain, if the Tropical Storm stays over warm oceanic\nwaters, it will continue to intensify in strength and size.\nOnce sustained wind speeds exceed 74mph, a hurricane\nis born.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Summary of Formation Sequence\nTropical Disturbance: Sustained winds below 23mph\nTropical Depression: Sustained winds 23-38 mph\nTropical Storm: Sustained winds 39-74 mph\nHurricane: Sustained winds greater than 74 mph\nTROPICAL CYCLONE FEATURES\n- spiral bands (bands of rain getting more intense closer to the eye wall)\n- no fronts\n- eye and eye wall cloud\n- 100-600 mi diameter is typical\nHURRICANE NAMES http:\/\/www.nhc.noaa.gov\/aboutnames.shtml#enp\nAtlantic tropical storms are named by the National Hurricane Center and are maintained\nand updated by an international committee of the World Meteorological Organization.\nMale names alternate with women's names in a 6-year cycle as shown on the chart on the\nfollowing page.

They occur\nin warm, moist areas, especially in the tropics and over continents during the summer and\nfall months. Thunderstorms are virtually non-existent north of 60\u02daN and south of 60\u02daS\nlatitude. Thunderstorms develop from cumulus clouds which are allowed to progress into\nmature cumulonimbus clouds. The stages of development are:\n\u2022 Cumulus stage: updrafts prevail and the cloud grows vertically\n\u2022 Mature stage: Both updrafts and downdrafts occur with hail, rain, strong winds,\nan anvil-head shape, lightning and thunder.\n\u2022 Dissipating stage: Downdrafts dominate, light rain still possible\nStages of Thunderstorm Development: https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/life\nSource: https:\/\/www.nssl.noaa.gov\/education\/svrwx101\/thunderstorms\/\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver For an in-depth description of specific types of thunderstorms including ordinary cells,\nmulti-cluster cells, squall lines and supercells, check out this link:\nhttps:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/tstrmtypes\nLightning\nLightning is the discharge of electricity and occurs in mature thunderstorms. It is caused\nby charges (pos. and neg.) separating in clouds, creating electrical potential.\nLightning equalizes these differences in electrical potential.\nThunder\nThunder is the sound made by lightning\nas a compressional wave is sent out from\nthe displaced air. The sound can range\nfrom a loud crack or bang to a soft\nrumble, depending how far you are from\nthe source. The distance of the lightning\ncan be calculated by the listener based on\nhow many seconds elapse between the\nflash of the lightning and the sound of the\nresulting thunder. Since the speed of light is about 300,000,000 m\/s or 186,000 miles per\nsecond, we consider that to be pretty much instantaneous for events on the Earth. The\nspeed of sound is about 343 m\/s or about 760miles per hour, depending on the air density.\nThe difference between these rates of speed means that every 5 seconds that elapses\nbetween the flash of lightning and the noise of thunder is equal to about 1 mile of\ndistance.\nOccurance\n1500-2000 lightning storms are active and occur around the world at any time. However,\nsome places are more susceptible than others to thunderstorm activity. The most globally\nactive place to witness thunderstorms is equatorial west Africa, as shown on the NASA\nmap below, which shows the average annual number of lightning flashes\/square km.\nhttp:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/vision\/earth\/lookingatearth\/intense_storms.html\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver US Thunderstorms\nFor the USA, the highest concentration of thunderstorms is in the southeastern states of\nFlorida, Georgia, and Alabama.

The oscillation occurs in an approximately 2- to 5-year cycle and refers to\nchanges in both sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and atmospheric pressure on both sides\nof the equatorial Pacific.\nIn order to understand the phenomena known as El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO for\nshort), we have to break down the process into three distinct components known as\nNormal Conditions, La Ni\u00f1a Conditions, and El Ni\u00f1o Conditions. We must also\nunderstand that this is mainly a tropical Pacific phenomenon, but it does have long-range\nimpacts to other parts of the world, which we are just beginning to understand.\nNormal Conditions: The trade winds blow with normal force from east to west, creating\na flow of warm tropical Pacific waters away from South America and towards the\nwestern Pacific (Australia & Indonesia) which experiences low atmospheric pressure &\nexcessive rains. At the same time the tropical Americas experience rather dry conditions,\nhigh atmospheric pressure, and chilly sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The chilly waters\nare due to cold water upwelling from deep in the Pacific as the surface waters are dragged\nto the west by the trade winds. These cold upwelling waters are rich in dissolved\nnutrients, which provide a base for algae and plankton to bloom once the cold water sees\ndaylight. Great fisheries are found along the west equatorial coast of South America (the\neastern part of the Pacific) because of the upwelling of these nutrient rich waters.\nhttp:\/\/www.pmel.noaa.gov\/tao\/elnino\/nino_normal.html\nLa Nina Conditions: Every now and then the trade winds blow with increased force,\nyielding a stronger westward flow of warm tropical Pacific waters towards the western\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Pacific, where Australia & Indonesia experience even lower atmospheric pressure and\nexcessive rains, while the tropical Americas experience drier than normal conditions,\nmore upwelling, and more bountiful fisheries.\nhttp:\/\/www.pmel.noaa.gov\/tao\/elnino\/nino_normal.html\nEl Nino Conditions: Every few year, for reasons still to be uncovered, the trade winds\nweaken. The result of this is that the warm water which had been piling up (and pushed\ndown) along the coastlines of the western Pacific (Australia, Indonesia) begins to slowly\nmigrate eastwards across the equatorial Pacific, eventually arriving as abnormally warm\nsea-surface temperatures (SSTs) along the coast of Ecuador and Peru in December-\nJanuary, and with it low atmospheric pressure and rainfall. At the same time, the western\npacific is experiencing colder-than-normal SSTs, high atmospheric pressure and drought.\nThese changes in SSTs are referred to as El-Nino, while the changes in atmospheric\npressure are referred to as the Southern Oscillation.\nhttp:\/\/www.pmel.noaa.gov\/tao\/elnino\/nino_normal.html\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Historical ENSO Trends\nThe following link shows ENSO trends (known as the Oceanic Nino Index) since 1950\nbut the past 28 years of data are shown in the chart below. Blue represents La Ni\u00f1a, red\nrepresents El Ni\u00f1o, and black represents Normal conditions.\nhttp:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/products\/analysis_monitoring\/ensostuff\/ensoyears.shtml\nDESCRIPTION: Warm (red) and cold (blue) episodes based on a threshold of +\/- 0.5oC for the Oceanic Ni\u00f1o\nIndex (ONI) [3 month running mean of ERSST.v3b SST anomalies in the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region (5oN-5oS, 120o-170oW)],\nbased on the 1971-2000 base period. For historical purposes cold and warm episodes (blue and red colored numbers)\nare defined when the threshold is met for a minimum of 5 consecutive over-lapping seasons.\nBased on this data, of the 29 Southern California winters encompassed between January\n1990 and February 2018 there were 8 years where the January to March period (Southern\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver California\u2019s rainy season) was in the El Ni\u00f1o stage, 11 years with Normal Conditions,\nand 10 in the La Ni\u00f1a stage. This means that on average, in recent years we\u2019ve seen an\nEl Ni\u00f1o stage about once every 3.5 years. Note the rather large El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98, a\nyear which brought about double the normal precipitation to Los Angeles. The 2015-16\nEl Ni\u00f1o saw even warmer ocean temperatures but did not translate into excessive\nprecipitation for Southern California. Here\u2019s a short video clip of the 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o\ncompared to the current conditions. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=whsQbIwWjBo\nEl Nino Effects on Los Angeles\nIt is important to remember that ENSO is a tropical Pacific phenomenon, but there are\nindeed far-reaching impacts. In essence, the build-up of warmer surface waters along the\neastern Pacific during the El Ni\u00f1o stage means that there is a lot more moisture in the\nMaritime Tropical air masses there. These air masses are the source of moisture for Mid-\nLatitude Wave Cyclones, the winter storms of the mid-latitudes. During El Ni\u00f1o years, it\nappears that winter storms approaching the west coast of the USA draw in more moisture\nfrom these mT air masses, so that the same number of storms can yield higher rainfall\nthan normal for places like Los Angeles. At the same time, it appears that upper air flow\nis diverted by the expanded presence of mT air masses, which affects the location of the\nsub-tropical and sub-polar jet streams. It also appears that Los Angeles begins its rainy\nseason with slightly higher than normal precipitation during the typical La Ni\u00f1a phase,\nfollowed by much lower than normal rainfall from January to May, so that the total\nannual precipitation is lower than the long-term average during the La Ni\u00f1a phase. This\nresearch is ongoing, and answers are sure to come as to the myriad of impact ENSO\nexerts on Southern California as well as far-away places.\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver Current Conditions (March 2018)\nhttp:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/products\/analysis_monitoring\/lanina\/enso_evolution-status-fcsts-web.pdf\nEl Ni\u00f1o conditions are constantly monitored by NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center, and\nthis agency releases monthly status reports and weekly updates. As of March, 2018 La\nNi\u00f1a conditions are present with cooler than normal equatorial sea surface temperatures\n(SSTs) across most of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. The current prediction is for\nLa Ni\u00f1a conditions to continue through our 2018 spring months. Based on this\ninformation, can you guess what the impact will be on LA\u2019s winter\/spring rainfall?\n\u00a9 Text Copyright 2018 Darren Leaver CLIMATE ZONES and BIOMES\nIn the previous chapters we learned about how the earth interacts with radiation from the sun to\nheat our atmosphere and put it into motion. We\u2019ve explored the composition and layers of the\natmosphere, how energy is moved from one place to another, how atmospheric molecules rise in\nlow pressure cells, sink in high pressure cells, and then flow across the surface as wind. We\u2019ve\nlearned about the movement of water in the atmosphere, the formation of clouds, the many types\nof precipitation that these clouds produce, and we\u2019ve explored the storm systems which bring the\nvarious air masses together. Now we\u2019ll use this knowledge to explore the various climate zones\nwhich exist on our planet and describe the general characteristics of the large ecosystems\n(biomes) associated with each climate zone. We\u2019ll describe what makes each zone unique in\nterms of climate and vegetation, map out the locations of these zones, and then we\u2019ll determine\nthe main reasons why these zones exist where they do.\nWhat is Climate?\nWhile weather refers to atmospheric conditions for a specific place and time, Climate refers to\natmospheric conditions for a large region over a long period of time. For the most part, a specific\nClimate is determined by analyzing monthly temperature and precipitation patterns over long\nperiods of time (typically 30 years or more). The analysis involves not just the average\ntemperature and precipitation, but also if there is a strong seasonal component to these variables\n(e.g. whether most of the precipitation falls in the winter or if it\u2019s evenly spread throughout the\nyear).\nWhat Influences Climate?\nAs a reminder, the main factors which work together to produce different climate types around\nthe world are:\n1. Latitude\nClimate zones are generally colder at the poles and warmer near the tropics.\n2. Elevation\nHigh mountains like Mount Everest are cold and dry places, while low elevations tend to\nbe warmer.\n3. Distance from a Large Water Body\nCoastal locations like Santa Monica have more moisture in the air, which means summers\nare cooler and winters milder than for inland (dry) locations at the same latitude such as\nLancaster and Palmdale, CA.\n4. Topographic (mountain) Barriers\nHigh barriers like mountains steal moisture on the windward side so that there\u2019s no water\nleft for the leeward (rainshadow) side. This explains why downtown LA gets about 14\u201d\nof rainfall annually, the top of the San Gabriel Mountains get about 40\u201d annually and\nPalmdale (on the leeward side of the mountains) gets about 6\u201d annually. The winter rain\njust cannot get to other side of the mountains.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 1 5. General Circulation of the Atmosphere\nOur atmosphere has a natural circulation patterns which promotes air rising (and cooling)\nat the equator. This constantly-rising equatorial air promotes the growth of clouds and\nrain, so that equatorial locations frequently receive 60 to 150\u201d or more of rain annually.\nConversely, this same atmospheric circulation pattern promotes the sinking of air close to\n30N and 30S latitude. This sinking air does not allow for the development of clouds, so\nthese areas tend to be occupied by dry deserts. The contrast of equatorial and subtropical\nweather\/climate illustrates the important impact of the atmosphere\u2019s natural circulation\npattern.\n6. Ocean Circulations\nLikewise, our oceans have a natural circulation pattern to them. Northern Hemisphere\ncurrents turn constantly towards their right, resulting in a clockwise circulation pattern.\nThis means warm equatorial waters will be driven towards Florida along the current\nknown as the Gulf Stream. The warm, most air above this current is pulled inland, giving\nFlorida warm, humid summers with afternoon thunderstorms. Conversely, the West\nCoast of the USA is under the influence of the cold water California Current, resulting in\ncool, stable air masses along the coast (this may give morning fog but not afternoon\nthunderstorms in the summer).\n7. Storms\nThere is a pattern to the location of storms and the paths they follow, which we refer to as\n\u201cstorm tracks.\u201d Some places like Seattle, WA are located smack in the middle of storm\ntracks, giving them year-round potential for rainfall. Conversely, places like San Diego,\nCA are located on the edge of these storm tracks, resulting in less rainfall as the storms\nonly reach them in the midst of winter.\nGEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF CLIMATE ZONES\nThe K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification System\nClimate types have been identified, described, and mapped in any number of ways over the\nyears, but the classification system we\u2019ll use was developed by Wladimir K\u00f6ppen (1846-1940), a\nRussian-born meteorologist and botanist of German descent. He published an early version of\nthe K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system in the early 1900s, and he continually modified his\nwork over the next four decades. In the 1920s and 1930s K\u00f6ppen cooperated with many climate\nscientists, including the German climatologist Rudolf Geiger. After K\u00f6ppen's death in 1940,\nGeiger continued to work on modifications to the climate classification system. The system we\nstill use is formally referred to as the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger Climate Classification System, but we\noften still call it the Modified K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification System for ease. It is interesting to\nnote that K\u00f6ppen\u2019s son-in-law was Alfred Wegener, who we\u2019ll discuss in later chapters.\nThe K\u00f6ppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and\nprecipitation. The most commonly used form of the K\u00f6ppen classification has five primary\ntypes labeled A through E, moving from the tropics to the poles, respectively, plus the\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 2 designation \u201cH\u201d for Highland climates where elevation becomes the dominant climate\ndeterminant. See the following link for specific details on the letters used in the K\u00f6ppen System.\nhttps:\/\/www.weather.gov\/jetstream\/climate_max\nA Tropical\nBW Dry Desert\nBS Dry Steppe (not as dry as BW)\nC Mesothermal (generally found in the lower mid-latitudes, 30-45 degrees N and S)\nD Microthermal (generally found in the upper mid-latitude, 45-65 N)\nET Polar Tundra\nEF Polar Ice Cap\nH Highland\nThese primary classifications can be further divided into secondary (lower case) letters:\nMoisture Classification (lower-case letters)\nf wet all year\nm monsoon\nw wet and dry with winter drought\ns summer drought|\nn fog\nTemperature Classification (lower-case letters)\nk cold and dry\nh hot and dry\na very hot summer\nb very warm summer\nc warm summer\nd cool summer with very cold winter\nCombining the primary and secondary letters (2-4 total letters) gives us the lettering system at\nthe heart of the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification system. For instance, Csa refers to a mesothermal\nclimate typically found between 30 and 45 degrees latitude with dry, very hot summers. We call\nthis a mediterranean climate, which should sound familiar because this is the climate type of\ncoastal Southern California! So, even though all of us living from San Francisco to San Diego\nare thousands of miles from the coastlines of Italy, Greece, and Spain, we\u2019re all very much\nmediterranean!\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 3 Simplified K\u00f6ppen Climate Map\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 4 CLIMATE\u2019S INFLUENCE ON ECOSYSTEMS AND BIOMES\nAccording to the US Environmental Protection Agency (http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/ebtpages\/ecosystems.html)\nan Ecosystem is \u201ca place having unique physical features, encompassing air, water, and land,\nand habitats supporting plant and animal life.\u201d Thus, an ecosystem is not just a grouping of\nplants and animals, but also includes the environment upon which the plants and animals depend\nfor sustenance. There are all types and sizes of ecosystems, from the microscopic ecosystems on\nyour hands right now, to enormous ecosystems which are big enough to encompass large chunks\nof continents.\nPhysical Geographers focus on ecosystems which are large enough to be mapped on a global\nscale, and we call these ecosystems Biomes. According to NASA\u2019s Earth Observatory\n(http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Experiments\/Biome\/vocabulary.php), a Biome is defined as \u201ca\ncommunity of plants and animals living together in a particular climate.\u201d Since climate is\ndetermined largely by precipitation and temperature, and since the type of plant that can survive\nnaturally is determined largely by the temperature and precipitation of the plant\u2019s location, the\nlocations of biomes are determined mostly by the climate that exists there.\nBiomes are defined initially into two categories: aquatic (water-based) and terrestrial (land-\nbased) biomes. Aquatic biomes are further divided into Marine biomes (coral reefs, intertidal,\netc.) and Freshwater biomes (lake, wetland, marsh, etc.). Geographers focus more on\nTerrestrial Biomes, which are defined largely by their dominant plant properties (tree, shrub or\ngrass; broadleaf or needle-leaf; forest or woodland), and to a lesser degree by the animals present\n(bears or tigers; monkeys or squirrels). Remember, if the environment isn\u2019t quite right for an\nanimal it can move away, while this luxury proves a little out-of-reach for plants.\nThere have been numerous attempts to make sense of the world\u2019s biome distributions. Some\nscientists tend to split a biome into two or more individual biomes, where others tend to group\ntwo or more into a single biome. Furthermore, the borders of biomes may differ depending on\nthe specific criteria used to delineate them. Add to this the fact that biomes are changing based\non the activities of humans, from global climate change and seal-level rise to direct habitat\ndestruction. Where Biomes show what should be there, we often find that the natural plants,\nanimals and habitat are quite different from what was there 200 years ago, sometimes even just a\nfew years ago.\nIt\u2019s also important to realize that biomes have transitional borders. It\u2019s not that you leave a\ndesert by taking one step and all of a sudden you find yourself in a land of grasses and shrubs.\nInstead, there is typically a transition zone, often tens of miles wide and irregular in pattern,\ncontaining elements of both desert and shrubby grassland before you truly leave the desert\nbehind. These zones of transition are called ecotones and it is important to recognize that they\nexist at most biome boundaries.\nThe map on the following page is a good representation of Global Biome Distribution. Notice\nthat ecotones aren\u2019t represented on this map since they are too small to see at this map scale.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 5 Please take a minute to compare the map of Global Biome Distribution with the maps of Global\nClimate Zones. Do you see any similarities? Where do we find the world\u2019s Tropical Rainforest\nBiomes? Where do we find the Tropical Wet Climate Zones? Are Climate Zones and Biomes\noriented in an east-west pattern or a north-south pattern? Which factor do you think is more\nresponsible for determining this pattern, Latitude or Longitude?\nThere\u2019s a lot of information to contemplate already, so moving forward we\u2019ll focus on\ndescribing and analyzing the main climate zones and then describe the general biome\ncharacteristics associated with each of them.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 6 K\u00f6ppen Climate Zones\nTROPICAL WET (Af)\nTropical wet (Af) climate zones are warm and wet all year. They are generally found close to\nthe equator where they are under the influence of the ITCZ year-round.\nLocations:\n- Equatorial (about 10\u02daN to 10\u02daS)\n- Windward slopes of trade winds\n- Amazon Basin\n- Congo Basin\n- Indonesia and Malaysia\nRainfall in the Tropical Wet typically ranges from\n60\" to 150\" per year (but can be over 400\" per\nyear in the world\u2019s wettest locations). These\nregions receive at least 2.4\" of rainfall during the\ndriest month, meaning the soil remains moist all\nyear. Though it could rain on any given day and\nat any given time, a typical rainfall pattern would\nbe light rainfall in the early morning with heavy\nrainfall during the afternoon\/evening.\nTemperatures remain quite warm in the Tropical\nWet. Mean monthly temperatures exceed 64\u00b0F\nevery month and typically stay within a range\nbetween the low 70\u2019s and the low 90\u2019s\n(Fahrenheit) year-round. Temperatures change so\nlittle from month-to-month and from day-to-day,\ngiving these regions the world\u2019s lowest Annual\nTemperature Range (2-6\u02daF) and Daily\nTemperature Range (10-15\u02daF).\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 7 The Tropical Wet Climate Zone is associated with the Tropical Rainforest Biome. Within these\nzones of constant high temperatures, high humidity, and year-round precipitation the vegetation\ndoesn\u2019t have to worry about moisture availability. Instead, seedlings must focus their energy on\ngrowing as fast and tall as possible, so they\ncan reach the available sunlight before being\ncrowded out by other plant species.\nTherefore, the dominant plants found in the\nTropical Rainforest Biome are tall, broadleaf\nevergreen trees such as Mahogany, Teak,\nBanyan and Ironwood.\nThe entire ecosystem seems to be dependent\nupon the constant growth of leaves, nuts,\nseeds, fruits, roots, branches and trunks of the trees, and there are literally tens of thousands of\nplant and animal species which live on and below these trees. The tropical rainforest has been\npresent for at least the past 65 million years, so that plants and animals have had plenty of time to\nevolve and to require very specific environments, so much so that this one biome is home to over\nhalf of all known plant and animal species on earth.\nFour distinct areas can be defined within rainforest trees, each with unique properties: the\nemergent, canopy, understory and forest floor layers (see\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rainforest#Layers).\nThe emergent layer contains very tall trees, often growing to over 200 feet in height and\nsticking up above all other trees around them. Birds of prey like the Harpy Eagle live in the\nemergent layer along with several species of bats, monkeys and insects.\nThe canopy layer consists of hundreds of tree species about 100 to 150 feet in height that\nhave inter-connecting branches and leaf matter, so that they capture most of the available\nsunlight. The canopy contains the highest biodiversity and biomass of the rainforest, making\nit the richest biological treasure trove on the planet. The rainforest canopy is home to insects,\nmonkeys, sloths, snakes, birds, and even other plants which grow on the main tree (including\nvines and epiphytes).\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 8 The understory layer lies below the canopy in an area of shade and diffuse light because less\nthan 10% of the available sunlight makes it past the canopy layer. Therefore, the leaves must\nbe quite large in order to catch enough sunlight to grow. Although the leaves are large in this\nlayer, many plants are no larger than shrubs. The tallest understory plants are not tall by any\nstandards, rarely growing taller than 10-20 feet in height. Most of the species found in the\nunderstory live their entire life cycle here, while others are seedlings of tallest canopy or\nemergent species just waiting for an opening so they can grow to maturity. The understory is\nhome to birds, snakes, frogs, and a huge number of insects.\nThe forest floor is a dark, shady environment which receives very little (estimated around\n2%) of the available sunlight. A few plants and fungi have adapted to this low-light\nenvironment, but the great majority of the forest floor is void of vegetation. This area is\nhome to the wide birds-foot-like buttresses of the taller trees, which serve to stabilize the\ntrees from heavy winds. It is important to remember that young rainforest trees tend to grow\nupwards (to reach sunlight quickly) rather\nthan put their energy into making deep root\nsystems (especially as the deeper rainforest\nsoils are nutrient poor). As the trees\nmature and grow taller, they create the\nbuttresses to stabilize themselves.\nBetween the buttresses the forest floor is\ncomposed of decaying leaves, branches,\nand the fallen fruit and nuts. The high\ntemperatures and moist conditions mean\nthat this fallen organic material\ndecomposes quickly into a rich uppermost\nsoil layer known as humus. The tree roots\nare concentrated in the humus layer, where they can absorb nutrients efficiently, so the\nnutrients make their way back into the trees very rapidly. Animals such as the Agouti and\nPeccary rummage through the fallen fruits and nuts for their sustenance, while these animals\nfall prey to large predators such as Jaguars and constrictor snakes. Ants, termites and fungi\naid in the decomposition of organic material on the forest floor, so the entire system allows\nfor an efficient, natural recycling of energy and nutrients.\nThe world\u2019s main rainforests are located in Central\nand South America, Central Africa, Southeast Asia,\nand Northeast Australia. Tropical rainforests\noccupied about 12 percent of the earth\u2019s land area\njust a few thousand years ago, but that percentage is\nnow less than 5 percent. Though there are many\nreasons for the disappearance of tropical rainforests,\nthey are rapidly disappearing mainly due to human\nactivities such as deforestation and conversion to\nfarmland and plantations. This is especially true in\nareas like the island of Borneo where the rainforests\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 9 are being converted to Palm Oil plantations. This practice is placing enormous strain on\nrainforest animals, particularly the pygmy rhinoceros, proboscis monkey, gibbon and orangutan\n(see http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rainforest#Deforestation).\nTROPICAL MONSOON (Am)\nTropical monsoon (Am) climate zones are very similar to the tropical wet (some people even\ninclude them as one single climate zone) except that there is a short dry season with 1 to 4\nmonths receiving less than 2.4\u201d of precipitation. This climate region also sees heavy\nsummertime rain as the wet monsoon winds blow from the sea to the land.\nTropical Monsoon Climate Regions\n- Windward coasts of South Asia and SE Asia\n- Includes India, Myanmar, and Thailand\n- Parts of tropical Central & South America\n- Parts of tropical Africa\nIn the Tropical Monsoon annual rainfall typically ranges from 100-200\", but can be as high as\n425\". This precipitation falls mainly within the summer months. These regions have a distinct\nwinter dry season\nlasting from one to four\nmonths with rainfall\namounts of less than\n2.4\"\/month.\nThough still quite low,\nTropical Monsoon\nregions have a slightly\nlarger ATR (4 to 15 F)\nand DTR (10 to 16 F)\ncompared to Af\nClimate zones. The\nhottest month is\ntypically in late spring,\njust as the clouds and\nrain arrive.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 10 The Biome associated with the Tropical Monsoon Climate Zone is known as the Tropical Deciduous\nForest. This Biome is also known as the Tropical Monsoon Forest, Tropical and Subtropical Dry\nForest, and Tropical Seasonal Forest.\nThese forests are located on the margins of the Tropical Rainforest (such as the margins of the Amazon\nrainforest and parts of India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Cambodia) due to the short but significant dry\nseason. The total annual precipitation may be quite high in the Tropical Deciduous Forest, but there is a\ndistinct dry season of 1 to 4 months, and in\norder to survive the vegetation has to respond\nto this short drought. Though broadleaf\nevergreen trees can exist where they can\naccess groundwater year-round, the dominant\ntrees in this biome are broadleaf deciduous\ntrees such as teak and ebony. These\ndeciduous trees respond to the drought\nperiods by lying dormant and shedding their\nleaves in order to reduce transpiration, and by\nnot growing quite as tall as they would in the\nTropical Rainforest.\nThe shedding of leaves means that sunlight can reach the ground level, thereby allowing for the\ngrowth of thick underbrush. Tropical Deciduous Forests are less biologically rich than Tropical\nRainforests, but are still home to an enormous variety of insects, birds, frogs, and mammals such\nas rodents, monkeys and large cats like the tiger.\nTROPICAL SAVANNA (Aw)\nThe tropical savanna (Aw) climate zone is often called the tropical wet and dry climate zone,\nlargely because this climate region sees half the year with significant rainfall, while the other half\nof the year is quite dry. Average temperatures remain quite warm (64\u00b0F or higher) year round\nand rainfall between 35\u201d and 70\u201d a year, most of which falls during the summer months.\nTropical Savanna Climate Regions\n- Located just poleward of Af\/Am\n- Parts of tropical Africa (Big Game Parks)\n- Parts of South Asia (India)\n- Parts of the Central and South. America\n- Parts of the Caribbean\n- Southernmost Florida (Miami)\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 11 The region is under the influence of the ITCZ and its associated rainfall during the summer. As\nthe seasons change the region becomes under the influence of the dry Sub Tropical High\nPressure Zone in winter, with\nthree to six months receiving\nless than 2.4\u201d of rain\/month.\nDuring these winter months\nthe soils can dry out\nsignificantly, and the native\nplants need to adapt to this.\nThe hottest month is usually\nin late spring, and both the\nATR are DTR are higher than\nthe other two tropical climate\nzones (5-20\u02daF) when\ncompared to Af or Am\nclimates.\nThe Tropical Savanna Climate Zone is associated with the biome called the Tropical\nWoodland, Scrub and Savanna. This biome is characterized by the presence of scattered trees\n(woodland) with thorny bushes (scrub) and tropical grasses\n(savanna) located between the trees, which together can be\nreferred to as the \u2018trifecta\u2019 of the Tropical Woodland, Scrub\nand Savanna biome. In the wetter portions of this biome\nthere are more trees, but their canopies are not inter-\nconnecting (this is the main difference between a forest and\nwoodland) which allows for the limited growth of scrub\nand grasses between the trees. In the drier portions of this\nbiome there are only scattered trees, so the landscape is\ndominated by either scrubland or grassland, but usually\nboth together. The composition of this biome is further\ncomplicated by the use of fire by humans and natural\nlightning strikes. The fire normally only scorches the\nouter bark of the trees but it burns away the scrub and\ngrasses. After the fire, the grasses are quick to regenerate\nfrom seed, while the bushes take much longer time to\ngrow back. This creates a biome where grasses exist in\nlarger abundance (and scrub in less abundance) than they\nwould likely be without the use of fire. In Africa the abundant savanna grasslands provide an\nenormous food source for grazing herbivores like zebra, wildebeest, and cattle. The grasslands\nare found between woodlands or scattered patches of Acacia and Baobab trees, and short, thorny,\ndrought-resistant scrub (known as African thorn scrub).\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 12 The Tropical Woodland, Scrub and Savanna biome is\nwell represented in Tropical and Subtropical regions of\nAfrica, South America, South Asia, and the eastern\nislands of Indonesia to northern Australia. The flora\nand fauna of these areas have adapted to a climate with\nprecipitation for 6 to 8 months of the year and drought\nfor the remainder of the year, which precludes the\npresence of forests. Plants have adapted to this\nsignificant dry period by growing smaller leaves and\nless of them.\nIn Africa the Acacia tree has adapted to this\nenvironment by using a deep tap root to access\ngroundwater supplies during the dry season. This plant\nalso has long, sharp thorns and an ability to quickly\nmake its leaves more alkaline and bitter-tasting once\nanimals begin to browse on them. These adaptations\nhelp prevent large-scale leaf-loss from the Acacia.\nAnother African tree, the Boabab, has tiny leaves for\nits size and also stores huge volumes of water in its\nmassive trunk in order to survive the dry season.\nAnimals tend to deal best with the challenges of the\ndry season by lying dormant in underground burrows\nor by temporarily migrating to more favorable\nlocations. Migratory animals in this biome include the\nzebra, wildebeest, and numerous bird species.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 13 Exercise:\n\u2022 Locate the three Tropical (A) climate zones on the following map and then draw them\nonto a blank outline map of world climates (from your professor).\n\u2022 Can you describe the locations of the tropical climate zones relative to each other?\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 14 DRY (B) CLIMATES\nThe Koppen \u201cB\u201d climates fall into two categories, desert (or arid) and steppe (or semi-arid),\nboth of which have low annual precipitation totals and high rates of potential evapotranspiration\n(the amount of moisture that could be evaporated away from the land IF there was enough\nmoisture there to do so).\nDesert Climate (BW)\nDesert (BW) climates are very arid regions characterized by very low precipitation, very high\npotential evapotranspiration, and low humidity. Because the air is so dry in deserts, they have an\nability to become very hot in the afternoons but also to cool down overnight to near-freezing\ntemperatures, giving deserts some of the largest Daily Temperature Ranges in the world.\nThere are two main varieties of desert climates based largely on their geographic location: Sub-\nTropical Deserts and Mid-Latitude Deserts. Subtropical (Hot) Deserts (BWh) are found at sub-\ntropical latitudes (approx. 20-30\u02da) where they are constantly under the presence of the Sub-\nTropical High Pressure Zone (STHPZ). These deserts include the Sahara Desert, Arabian\nDesert, Kalahari Desert, Sonoran Desert and Great Sandy Desert.\nThe second type of Desert is known as the Mid-Latitude (Cold) Desert (BWk). These include\nthe Gobi, Taklamakan, Mojave, Great Basin, and Patagonian deserts. These deserts may\nexperience the high atmospheric pressure of the STHPZ for part of the year, but their presence in\nthe mid-latitudes is due mainly to their distance from storm tracks and moisture sources, or for\nbeing in the rain-shadow of large mountain ranges.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 15 As the names might imply, the main difference between Hot Desert Climates and Cold Desert\nClimates is that of temperature. The average annual temperature of Hot Desert Climates is over\n64\u02daF, while for Cold Desert Climates it is 64\u02daF or below. In both desert types the dry air means\nthat the summers are very hot (120\u02daF or higher) and the winters can bring very cold (below\nfreezing) nights. Summer daytime temperatures tend to be higher for BWh climates, and winter\nnight-time temperatures tend to be lower for BWk climates. Both desert types have very large\nDaily Temperature Ranges (DTRs), often over 50\u02daF and at times over 100\u02daF, giving BWh\nclimates the world\u2019s highest DTRs. Annual Temperature Ranges (ATRs) are usually over 30\u02daF.\nAnnual precipitation totals are very low in both desert climates, typically less than 15\" for BWh\nclimates and less than 11\u201d for BWk climates. The slight difference between the two is due to the\nhigher rates of potential evaporation for BWh climates. Precipitation is not dependable from\nyear-to-year in the deserts. There might be heavy rainfall one year followed by almost none the\nnext year. Winters in BWk climates can be bone dry or they can bring small amounts of\nprecipitation, at times in the form of snow.\nConveniently, the biome associated with Desert Climates is known as the Desert Biome. Desert\nBiomes are found in approximately the same location as both Subtropical and Mid-Latitude\nDesert Climate Zones, areas of very low precipitation and very high potential evapotranspiration.\nKey examples are the Sahara, Arabian, Kalahari, Gobi, Atacama, Sonora, Colorado, Mojave, and\nGreat Victoria Deserts.\nDesert vegetation is\ndominated by scattered\nxerophytes, plants which\nhave adapted to very dry\nconditions. These\nxerophytic adaptations fall\ninto two basic categories:\nthose for annual plants and\nthose for perennial plants.\nAnnual plants, those which will survive for a single season, focus on\npassing along their genetic details through their seeds. This ensures the\npreservation of the species rather than the individual plant. In essence,\nseeds lay dormant in the thin soil until the rainy season arrives. Within\ndays to weeks the seeds begin to grow and flower. When the soil begins\nto dry these flowering plants also begin to dry and wither, they drop their\nseeds, they dry up and they die, with the seeds laying dormant until the\nnext rainy season. Examples of local desert annuals include the California\nPoppy (Escholtzia californiaca), Fiddleneck (Amsincaia sp.) and Gilia\n(Gilia latiflora).\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 16 Perennial plants, those which survive for many years, have numerous strategies for surviving the\ndry, hot afternoons and cold nights of the desert. These adaptations include:\n\u2022 Waxy or leathery leaves to reduce moisture loss\n\u2022 Small leaf size or thorns\/spines instead of leafs to\nminimize transpiration and predation\n\u2022 Extensive horizontal roots to collect water during\nthe rainy season\n\u2022 Deep tap roots to \u2018drill\u2019 down and \u2018tap\u2019 into the\ngroundwater supply\n\u2022 Storing moisture within their leaves, stems, and\nroots. Plants that do this are referred to as\nsucculents, and examples include the cactus.\n\u2022 Lay dormant during the dry times and grow very\nslowly.\n\u2022 Local examples of desert perennials include\ncreosote, various cacti, ocotillo, yucca, Joshua tree,\nsalt bush.\n\u2022 Opening leaf pores (stomata, from where\ntranspiration occurs) during the night or having\nvery few stomata compared with if the plant was\nlocated in a moister environment.\nAnimal adaptations to the desert biome include staying inactive within underground burrows or\nin the shade of plants or rocks during sunlight hours, and being active during the night\n(nocturnal) when temperatures are cool. Many animals get all of the water they need by eating\nplants, seeds, fruits and insects and by producing very little liquid waste. Some insects in the\nAtacama Desert have even adapted so that their main source of moisture is condensation they\ncollect on their exoskeleton in the early morning hours. Our local deserts are home to many\nlarge mammals but we seldom see them due to their nocturnal behavior. These include the\ncoyote, big horn sheep, mule deer, and badger.\nSteppe Climate (BS)\nUnless there is an intervening water body or mountain barrier, Desert Climates are usually\nsurrounded by zones of slightly higher moisture known as Steppe (BS) Climates. Here, there is\nusually enough annual precipitation to allow for the growth of shrubs and grasses, which are\ntypically absent in true deserts. Compare the patterns on the maps for BW and BS climates to\nsee the relationship between these climate zones.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 17 Steppe Climates\nThe pattern will become clearer when you compare the locations of Steppe (Semiarid) and\nDesert (Arid) Climates as shown on the following map. Can you now see that the Steppe\nClimates surround the Desert Climates as long as a mountain barrier or water body doesn\u2019t get in\nthe way?\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 18 As with desert climates, there are two main varieties of steppe climates based largely on the\ngeographic location. These are Subtropical (Hot) Steppe (BSh) and Mid-Latitude (Cold)\nSteppe (BSk). Again, unless cut off by the presence of mountains or water bodies, the locations\nof these climate zones are the areas surrounding BWh and BWk climate zones. The temperature\ncharacteristics are very similar to those of the deserts they surround, with hot summer days,\npotentially cold winter nights, and high ATRs and DTRs. For Hot Steppe Climates (BSh) the\nmean annual temperature is greater than 64\u02daF while for Cold Steppe Climates it is 64\u02daF or below.\nAnnual precipitation totals for Hot Steppe Climates is typically 15-30\u201d with most of this falling\nas intense rainfall during the summer months. Cold Steppe Climates would tend to receive 11-\n20\u201d of annual precipitation. Most of this falls in the winter months but intense, infrequent\nsummer downpours can occur.\nThe association of biomes with Steppe Climates is slightly complex, and requires us to link this\nclimate zone to two biomes. The Subtropical (Hot) Steppe Climate zone is associated with\nSavanna grasslands found in the driest parts of the Tropical Savanna and the Tropical\nWoodland and Scrub (see the section on the Tropical Savanna climate). These tropical\ngrasslands grow on the peripheries of the Sub-Tropical Deserts where rainfall totals are barely\nenough to sustain the growth of grasses and scattered shrubs.\nMid-Latitude (Cold) Steppe Climates are associated with the Mid-Latitude Grassland Biome.\nThis biome is characterized by relatively continuous\nstretches of grassland, though scattered shrubs are\noften intermingled, with trees existing only along\nriver banks and lake shores. The historical use of\nfire appears to be a contributing factor in the\ndominance of grasses at the expense of shrubs. This\nbiome is squeezed between the Desert Biome on the\nequatorial side and Temperate Mixed Forest Biome\non the polar side. The Tall Grass Prairie of the\ncentral USA grows to heights of 3 to 6 feet in an\narea where sufficient precipitation is received to\nallow the taller grasses to survive. These tall grasses\ngo by the name Pampas in Argentina and Veldt in South Africa.\nOn the drier margins of this biome the grasses tend to\nbe short, typically less than 1 foot in height. Short\nGrass Prairie, also called Steppe grass, grows in the\ndrier portions of this biome, such as the westernmost\nportions of the USA\u2019s Great Plains. This same term\n(Steppe) is used to describe the grasslands of central\nEurasia. Both Prairie and Steppe grasses die off\nannually above-ground, but the roots lay dormant\nduring the cold winter. When the warmth of spring\nand early summer arrive, the grasses grow once more\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 19 from the below-ground root system.\nMid-Latitude grasslands were once\nhome to huge herds of grazing\nherbivores like bison, antelope, and\nwild horses, and large carnivores\nsuch as lions, bears and wolves fed\nupon this plentiful supply of meat.\nHabitat destruction, agricultural\nconversion, over-hunting, climate\nchange and disease have\ncontributed to the general decline\nin the numbers of these animals. In\nmany cases, the natural herbivores\nhave been replaced with livestock,\nand the natural predators have been\neliminated through hunting,\ntrapping, poisoning, and habitat\nloss.\nMEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE (Csa\/Csb)\nThe Mediterranean climate zone is typical of many coastal zones around the Mediterranean\nSea, but also includes the coastal areas of Southern California, Western and South Australia,\ncentral Chile, and the Cape region of South Africa. Here, annual precipitation is higher than\ndeserts because these zones are under the influence of the STHPZ only during the hot, dry\nsummer months but are affected by\nperiodic winter storms.\nMediterranean climates which are\nlocated further poleward, and\ntherefore closer to the direct path of\nwinter storms, tend to get higher\nrainfall amounts than those further\naway from the paths of winter\nstorms.\nMediterranean Climate Zone\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 20 In general, Mediterranean climate regions are located along the western coastlines of continents\nin the lower mid-latitudes, approximately 30-45\u02da from the equator. These regions include the\ncoastlines of California, Spain, Chile, Portugal, Western and South Australia, and the\nsouthernmost tip of South Africa. At these latitudes, being under the influence of the STHPZ\nduring the summer months means long hot, dry weather for several summertime months. During\nthe winter months these regions are under the influence of the Prevailing Westerlies with their\noccasional winter storms which bring an average of 11-25\" of precipitation to Mediterranean\nclimates each year. As for temperatures, winter temperatures are relatively mild in\nMediterranean climate zones, especially at the coast. Summers are very warm to hot along the\ncoast, but can be incredibly hot just a few miles inland. For this reason we can split\nMediterranean climates into two major sub-divisions: Coastal Mediterranean (Csb) climates are\nfound at or very near the coast, with warm\/hot and dry summers like at Santa Monica or Santa\nBarbara. Inland Mediterranean (Csa) climates are located several miles from the coastline, with\nvery hot, dry summers. Glendale, Burbank and Pasadena have Csb climates.\nThe Mediterranean Woodland and Scrub biome is normally found in association with\nMediterranean Climate Zones. Since these areas\nexperience hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters,\nthe vegetation has adapted to these climatic\nconditions as well as to a poorly-developed soil.\nThere are several distinct plant communities\nrepresented within this biome, including woodland,\nshrub and grassland, but in most cases there will be\nelements of all three present. Still, let\u2019s explore these\ncommunities in more detail.\n\u2022 Mediterranean woodlands are typically\ncomprised of broadleaf trees and are most\ncommon in valley bottoms and riparian habitat\nwhere their roots can access groundwater year-\nround. In Mediterranean California the\ndominant woodlands are composed of Oak,\nWalnut, Sycamore, and in some cases even\nPine trees. In some cases where water is never\nin short supply, the woodland can exist as\nforest, with interconnecting canopies.\n\u2022 Mediterranean grasslands occur in isolated\nareas within California, but most have been converted to agriculture or have been grazed\naway. The dominant native grass of California was Purple Needle-grass (Nassella\npulchra), but it is estimated that less than 1 percent of the original grassland remains.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 21 Most of the remaining grasslands exist in the open spaces between Oak Woodlands and\nare still subject to grazing by cattle and deer.\n\u2022 Mediterranean Shrublands consist of thick masses of interconnecting bushes and small\ntrees. These plants are mainly sclerophyll (hard-leaf) shrubs collectively called chaparral\nin California, with common plants like sage,\nceanothus, toyon, buckwheat, scrub oak,\npoison oak, sagebrush and chamise. These\nplants usually have leathery or waxy leaves\nin order to retain moisture during the hot,\ndry summers, while some of the plants have\nvery deep root structures in order to tap into\nthe groundwater. In other Mediterranean\nBiomes the chaparral community goes by\nlocal names such as Matorral (Spain), Maquis (France) and Fynbos (South Africa). A\nvariety of chaparral called Coastal Sage Scrub is found immediately at the coastline, with\nshorter plant heights and softer leafs than the inland chaparral.\nAnimals of the Mediterranean Woodland and Shrub Biome vary from region to region. For\ncoastal California they include the coyote, black-tailed deer, bobcat, mountain lion, road-runner,\nrattle snake, red-tail hawk, Cooper\u2019s hawk, squirrel, and rabbit. Many of these are nocturnal,\nespecially in summer, so that they avoid the heat of the day.\nFire is a very important aspect of this biome\u2019s composition, as there is a slow progression\ntowards taller bushes and trees (with less biological diversity) if there has been no fire for 20 to\n30 years or more. In California, many of the chaparral plants (including sage and chamise) have\nhigh natural oil content, and chamise often becomes\nthe dominant shrub in areas that have not burned for\ndecades. When a fire does progress to these older\nstands of chamise it is often too hot to control easily\nand hillside homes are put at risk. However, there are\nsome major biological benefits derived from the\noccasional fire. The fire destroys the portions of tall\nshrubs that grow above ground (the roots are often left\nunharmed), the ash fertilizes the soil, and the heat of\nthe fire cracks open dormant seeds and removes toxins from the soil. For several years after the\nfire a rich biological assortment of low-growing herbaceous plants (collectively called pioneer\nspecies) can be found in the chaparral, but the process of plant succession continues over the\nyears as taller-growing bushes and trees begin to crowd out the pioneers. Twenty to 30 years\nafter the fire, the chaparral will once again be dominated by taller growing bushes and trees such\nas chamise, and a healthy dose of fire will be called for once more.\nQuestion: Why don\u2019t we allow for periodic fires in our chaparral hillsides?\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 22 HUMID SUBTROPICAL CLIMATE (Cfa, Cwa)\nHumid subtropical climate zones are located at latitudes of approximately 20 to 35\u02da on the east\nsides of major continents. These zones experience hot, humid summers and mild, moist winters.\nHumid Subtropical climates are heavily influenced by the presence of warm ocean currents,\nwhich supply them with a steady supply of warm, moist air. Precipitation in the late summer and\nFall is often associated with hurricanes.\nSome Key Details of Humid Subtripical Climate Zones\n- Mild winters with hot humid summers (over 72 degrees F)\n- Southeast portions of major continents between 20 and 35\u02da latitude.\n- Key areas include the Southeast USA (Cfa), southeastern China (Cfa), Northern India (Cwa),\nnortheastern Australia (Cwa)\n- Annual precipitation typically ranges from 40\u201d to 60\" with heavy afternoon rainfall in the\nsummer months, tropical storm-related rainfall in late summer and autumn, and rainfall in\nwinter from the occasional cold front.\n- These climate zones are heavily influenced by warm ocean currents\nThe biome associated with the Humid Subtropical climate zone is the Temperate Mixed Forest\nwhich is also known as the Mid-Latitude Deciduous Forest and Temperate Deciduous Forest.\nTemperate Mixed Forests are located in regions which experience very\nwarm, moist summers and cold, moist winters. The biome is dominated\nby broadleaf deciduous trees (oak, beech, maple, chestnut), but there are\nusually needle-leaf evergreen trees (pine, spruce, fir) present in the\nupper canopy as well as shrubs, flowers, grasses, mosses and fungi\ngrowing in the understory and forest floor. There are some regional\nvariations within this biome, with deciduous trees completely\ndominating some portions (Northeast USA) and evergreens dominating\nin other regions (Northwest and Southeast USA) but it is fair to say most\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 23 of these forests contain at least some evergreens and some deciduous trees (hence the name \u2018mixed\u2019\nforest).\nAnnual precipitation is typically between 30 and 60 inches per\nyear, and although this falls throughout the year there are four\ndistinct seasons: Spring sees the trees and flowers bud and\nbloom, with light green leaves filling the trees\u2019 branches;\nSummer sees the leaves fill into a full canopy, providing shade\nto a moist forest floor of maturing flowers, grass, and fungi.\nAt this time the fallen organic matter on the forest floor is\nbeing decomposed, releasing nutrients back to the forest soils\nbelow.\nThe first cool breezes of Autumn see the trees change\ncolor from green to yellow, orange and red, and then\nthe deciduous trees lose their leaves all together. In\nthe height of the winter cold, the trees go into a period\nof dormancy, protected from the cold by their outer\nbark layers and some internal respiration\nAnimals in this biome include the raccoon, chipmunk,\nsquirrel, fox, bobcat, deer, frogs, salamanders,\nbutterflies, and a large number of other insects can be\nobserved during the summer months.\nThe map of this biome in\nparticular provides an interesting\nlesson. The Biome Maps show us\nwhat should be there rather than\nwhat is actually present. The\nmaps show us that the entire\neastern USA and the western\nportion of Europe should be\ncompletely forested according to\nthe natural distribution of biomes.\nIndeed, prior to a few thousand\nyears ago this was true, but these\nareas of Temperate Mixed Forest\nhave been logged and converted\nto pasture, agriculture, roads, villages, towns and cities for at least the last few thousand years, so there\nis very little of this original forest left intact and undisturbed.\nAs detailed in the next two sections, the Temperate Mixed Forest biome is associated with two\nadditional climate zones, the Marine West Coast and the Humid Continental.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 24 MARINE WEST COAST CLIMATE (Cfb, Cfc)\nMarine West Coast (oceanic) climates are typically found along the coasts, just poleward of\nthe Mediterranean climate zones. In North America we find them along the Pacific coast from\nNorthern California to Alaska. Much of Ireland, Great Britain, Iceland, the west coast of France,\nNew Zealand and southeast Australia (including Tasmania) have Marine West Coast climates.\nThese zones are under the influence of the Westerly winds (and their associated storms) year-\nround, so precipitation is possible in all months.\nKey Details of Marine West Coast (Cfb, Cfc) Climates\n- Found on the northwest portion of continents between 40\u02da and 60\u02da latitude plus SE Australia\n- Examples include the Pacific Northwest, UK, New Zealand, coastal Alaska, and Tasmania\n- Mild humid summers and cool wet winters, with precipitation in all months\n- Typical precipitation is 30 to 50\" annually (more on windward mountain slopes)\n- Under the influence of the Prevailing Westerly Winds (with many overcast days) year-round\n- Mild summers and winters result from ocean current influences\n- Associated with the Temperate Mixed Forest biome\nHUMID CONTINENTAL (Dfa, Dfb, Dwa, Dwb, Dsa, Dsb) CLIMATE\nThe humid continental climate is found only in the northern hemisphere between about 35\u02daN\nand 55\u02daN latitude. These areas are characterized by large swings in temperature between\nsummer and winter, due in part to the continental locations far from sources of moisture (note\nthat some of these climate zones are located along coastlines, but in these cases the wind tends to\nblow the moisture away from the land rather than towards the land).\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 25 Key Details of Humid Continental Climates\n- Totally absent in Southern Hemisphere (there are no large mid-latitude continents there)\n- East sides of continents between 35 & 55 degrees latitude\n- Examples include New York, Chicago, NE China\n- Annual precipitation of 20 to 50\" is common, with rain and snow in winter, rain in summer\n- Cold winters, warm\/hot summers (very large ATR)\n- Summer mean temperatures are over 50\u02daF; winters usually below 27\u02daF\n- Associated with Temperate Mixed Forest biomes\nSUBARCTIC CLIMATE (Dfc, Dfd, Dwc, Dwd, Dsc, Dsd)\nSubarctic climate zones have the highest Annual Temperature Ranges in the world, due largely\nto their incredibly long, cold winter temperatures. They are located immediately north of Humid\nContinental climates. These zones have low annual precipitation but they also have low rates of\nevapotranspiration, so there\u2019s plenty of moisture available for the many coniferous trees here.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 26 Key Details for Subarctic Climate Zones\n- Totally absent in Southern Hemisphere\n- North America & Eurasia between 50-70 degrees latitude\n- Annual precipitation of 5 to 20\" is common, most falling in summer\n- Low rates of evaporation and evapotranspiration\n- Very cold winters, brief mild summers, with the largest ATRs in world\nThe resolution on the map above is not ideal, so check out the relative locations of the Humid\nContinental and Subarctic climate zones on this map.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 27 The Subarctic Climate Zone is associated with\nthe Taiga or Boreal (northern) Forest Biome, a\nnearly continuous east-west belt of coniferous\ntrees approximately 50\u02daN to 70\u02daN latitude in\nNorth America and Eurasia. The Boreal Forest\nBiome is limited to the Northern Hemisphere but\noccupies more area than any other terrestrial\nbiome on earth. Over 60% of this is found in\nRussia\u2019s Siberia region, with the remainder found\nin Canada, Alaska, and Scandinavia. To the\nnorth of this biome lies the Tundra, while to the\nsouth is the Temperate Mixed Forest.\nThe Boreal Forest Biome vegetation has adapted to survive mildly warm, moist summers and\nintensely cold, dry winters. The winters are so cold that the only trees able to survive are\nevergreen conifers (spruce, pine, fir) with their thick, protective bark to insulate the woody mass\nof the tree and needle leaves to reduce\ntranspiration. Conifers are so named because they\nhave cones instead of flowers, and are thus an\nancient type of tree (flowering plants evolved\nmuch later on). The forest floor is carpeted in\nneedles which decay so slowly that a thick mat of\nold needles develops. The decomposition of the\nneedles in the cold temperatures produces an acidic\nsoil which is unsuitable for many plant species.\nThe needle leafs of pine, spruce and fir trees do not\ncontain sufficient nutrients and energy to support large\nherds of herbivores. Some animals have adapted to this biome such as the moose, bear, wolves,\nwolverine, lynx, squirrel, and in Siberia the tiger. Additionally there are large numbers of migrating birds\nand deer which arrive in the Boreal Forest for the summer feast then return south for the winter.\nPOLAR TUNDRA (ET) CLIMATE ZONE\nTundra climates occur along the northern coastlines of North America and Eurasia, as well as\nthe coastline of Greenland where permanent ice does not exist. These regions are frozen most of\nthe year, but a brief summer allows temperatures to climb above freezing for one to three\nmonths. This brief thawing allows for small plants to grow furiously, which also attracts insects,\nbirds and other migrating animals.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 28 Key Details for Polar Tundra Climate (ET)\n- Located along high latitude coasts, approximately 65 to 70\u02daN latitude\n- Very cold and very dry\n- Less than 10\" annual precipitation, mostly falling as snow\n- Short summers with the warmest month between 32 and 50\u02daF with mosquitoes\n- Characterized by long, cold, dark winters\n- Associated with permanently-frozen soil layers called Permafrost\nThe Tundra Biome is found in the same general location as the Tundra Climate Zone, on the\nnorthern coastlines of North America and Eurasia, the southern coastlines of Greenland, and on\nmountain slopes throughout the world where it is\ntoo cold for trees to grow. The Tundra is frozen\nmost of the year but thaws out for one to four\nthree during summer. These regions also receive\nvery little precipitation (6-10\u201d is typical), similar\nin amount to a desert but with much less\nevapotranspiration, and with most precipitation\nfalling as snow.\nThe freezing temperatures create a layer of\npermanently frozen ground a few feet below the\nsurface called permafrost. When the Tundra\nthaws out during summer, the permafrost layer doesn\u2019t allow melted water in the upper soil to\ninfiltrate down, so the upper soils remain saturated. Stagnant pools of water are exposed to\nfull days of sunlight during the summer months, and this leads to a proliferation of hatching\ninsects such as flies and mosquitoes.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 29 Vegetation in the tundra has adapted to the long, cold winters and short summer growing\nseason. The dominant vegetation is an assemblage of short plants such as lichens, sedges,\ngrasses, flowering plants and mosses, which must be able to photosynthesize in cold\ntemperatures and with sunlight which arrives with low intensity. There is a distinct lack of\ntrees in the Tundra (with the exception of some dwarf varieties) as the cold winter is too long\nin duration, the growing season is just too short, and the permafrost layer prevents sufficient\nroot growth required for the survival of mature trees.\nAnimals of the Tundra Biome have also adapted to the harsh environment in a number of ways\nincluding:\n\u2022 Hibernating during the long, cold winter when food is not abundant.\n\u2022 Being able to efficiently store energy in fat cells during the summer, when food is\nplentiful.\n\u2022 Breeding and raising their young quickly during the brief summer.\n\u2022 Migrating south before the winter sets in (especially birds, reindeer, caribou).\nThe summer migration of fauna into the Tundra creates a very diverse collage of animals\nincluding caribou, polar bears, arctic foxes, hares, squirrels, wolves and lemmings. While the\nbasis of the food chain in this biome is largely the terrestrial plants, some of these animals\ndepend on fish such as cod, trout and salmon which are found in the rivers, streams and\ncoastlines of the Tundra. Migratory birds include falcons, terns, seagulls, loons, and ravens. The\nbirds feed upon the insects hatching in the stagnant ponds including flies, mosquitoes,\ngrasshoppers, bees, moths, and butterflies. The long, cold winters mean that reptiles are largely\nabsent from the Tundra.\nPOLAR ICE CAP (EF) CLIMATE\nAs the name implies the Polar Ice Cap climates are found at very high latitude, close to the\npoles. These areas receive no sunlight at all for half the year, and extended hours of low-angle\ninsolation for the other half of the year. The low angle of incoming sunlight means that average\nmonthly temperatures do not get above freezing, even in the midst of summer, while the winter\ntemperatures are bitterly cold. The main examples are found in Greenland and Antarctica, the\nareas shown in bright white on the following map.\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 30 Key Details for Polar Ice Cap (EF) Climates\n-The warmest month is below 32 F; coldest month can be less than -40\u02daF\n- Very low precipitation, from almost 0 to about 5\" \u2013 almost all falling as snow\n- Too cold and infertile for plants or animals to be around\n- Characterized by the presence of ice caps and glaciers\n- Greenland, Antarctic\nThere is no terrestrial biome associated with the\nPolar Ice Cap climate zone because (with the\nexception of limited red algae growth) there is no\nland-based food web in these permanently frozen\nareas. Any animals living on the edges of ice\ncaps and glaciers might well live on land for a\ngood portion of their lives, but invariably they\nare receiving their food supply from a marine\necosystem, usually in the form of fish or marine\nmammals. Examples include Penguins in the\nAntarctic and Polar Bears in the Arctic (though\nthese are associated more often with the Tundra biome).\nClimate Regions and Biomes \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Page 31 HIGHLAND (H) CLIMATES\nHighland (H) climates are those in which altitude is the dominant factor in determining climate\nclassification. Highland climates are technically considered to be K\u00f6ppen \u201cE\u201d climates. In\nessence, permanent ice caps can be found right at the equator if the elevation is high enough, as\nin the high mountains of Ecuador and New Guinea. The K\u00f6ppen system designates such places\nas Highland climates because the elevation out-weighed all other climatic factors here. Highland\nclimates can be found in all major mountain systems on earth including the Andes, Himalayas,\nRocky Mountains, and Europe\u2019s Alps.

Keep in mind that there are many variations on even the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification\nSystem, as scientists sometimes use different names for a climate zone, or they might group two\nclimate zones together to make it a little easier to understand the material.

As the early earth orbited our newly-formed sun, it swept up and pulled in enormous\nmasses of dust and rocks that were in its path. This constant bombardment heated the early earth\nto the point that the entire planet melted into a hostile environment of super-hot magma. The\nheavy materials like iron sank to Earth's interior to form the planet\u2019s core, while the lighter\nelements \u2018floated\u2019 to the outer layers. As the planet began to cool from the outside-in, a solid\n\u2018skin\u2019 began to form on the outermost layers. At the same time, gases like carbon dioxide,\nnitrogen, and water vapor were released from inside the planet and over tens of millions of years\nallowed for the development of an early atmosphere. The water vapor cooled and precipitated,\neventually producing the planet\u2019s oceans.\nThe earth\u2019s cooling process is still ongoing, so a portion of the earth\u2019s core remains liquid and\ncomposed of heavy elements, while earth\u2019s outermost layer is solid and composed of lighter\nelements. If we were to take the earth as a whole we would see that it\u2019s composed mostly of iron\n(32%), oxygen (30%), silicon (15%), magnesium (14%), sulfur (3%), nickel (1.8%), calcium\n(1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%); with the remainder consisting of trace amounts of other\nelements. However, we have to remember that due to mass segregation early in earth\u2019s history,\nthe heaviest elements settled towards the core of the earth, which is composed largely of heavy\nelements like iron (almost 90%), with smaller amounts of nickel and sulfur (about 10%), and less\nthan 1% trace elements. And again, the lighter elements \u2018floated\u2019 towards the outer surface, so\nthe minerals and rocks of our crust are made up primarily of lighter elements like Oxygen (47%),\nSilicon (28%), and Aluminum (8%) with lesser amounts of iron (5%), calcium (3.5%), sodium,\npotassium, magnesium and about 100 additional elements in very small concentrations.\n(http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements).\nIt sounds like we know a lot about the inside of the earth, but to be honest, nobody has been\nthere! The deepest mine in the world is less than 4 miles from the surface, and the deepest\nwell ever drilled extends about 7.5 miles from the surface. So how do we know so much\nabout our planet\u2019s internal chemistry and structure? In essence, we do this by combining the\nideas gained from astronomy, chemistry and physics (mass segregation) with information\nobtained by collecting and analyzing gas and lava samples released from inside the earth, and\nthrough the analysis of seismic waves which travel through the earth as a consequence of an\nearthquake or underground explosion. Check out these two\nlinks to better understand how earth scientists gain knowledge\nof the earth. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pEtg209pvdU and\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2bOma_5v88I\nSeismic Data yields knowledge of deeper zones. Whenever a\nlarge earthquake or underground explosion occurs within the\nearth\u2019s crust, three major types of seismic waves travel\noutward from the epicenter. Longitudinal waves travel across\nthe Earth\u2019s surface in a \u201crolling\u201d motion, and can make the\nlandscape look like a water bed during an earthquake. For this\ndiscussion however, we\u2019ll need to focus on the waves which\n\u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 travel through the earth rather than along the surface. Primary waves (P-waves) move quickly\nthrough the surface of the earth and can travel through both solid and liquid layers. They bend as\nthey encounter layers of different density, and by tracking the bending (refracting) waves we\nlearn a great deal about the density of layers inside the earth. Secondary waves (S-waves) travel\nmore slowly through the earth\u2019s interior and these waves cannot pass through liquids. Tracking\nthe S-wave shadow, where they have been blocked by the presence of a liquid layer inside the\nearth, allows us to map out the major solid and liquid layers within the earth. Applying the\nuniversal rules of Physics and Chemistry to the knowledge obtained through seismic analysis\nhelps to complete the picture of what\u2019s going on inside the planet. This way we can learn an\nawful lot about earth\u2019s interior without ever having to physically go there (which is impossible,\nby the way).\nThis analysis reveals several distinct layers inside the earth, so let\u2019s look at these in detail.\nThe Earth\u2019s Internal Structure\nThe solid, rocky portion of the earth is known as the Lithosphere, which technically is defined\nas both the Crust and Uppermost Mantle. The crust includes layers of solid rock (bedrock),\nbroken pieces of rock (sediment), a thin veneer of rotting rock (soil), as well as layers of volcanic\nash (tephra) and molten rock (called magma if below ground and lava if above the ground).\nTogether these make the earth materials of the crust. Later, we shall see how water, ice, wind\nand gravity act on these lithospheric earth materials to create unique landforms, but first we must\ndefine and explore the nature of some basic earth materials.\nThe crust is made of 90 elements like calcium, aluminum, sodium, oxygen, silica, and iron.\nThese elements form about 3,500 minerals like quartz, feldspar, and olivine, which in turn are\nthe building blocks of rocks such as granite, basalt and diorite.\nMain Elements of Earth\u2019s Crust\nElement %\nOxygen 47\nSilicon 28\nAluminum 8\nTOTAL 83%\nAll Other Elements 17%\nBrendan Fraser- the only \u201ctool\u201d that can\nmake it to the center of the Earth \u263a\nThere are two main varieties of crust know as Continental Crust and Oceanic Crust.\nContinental crust is composed of rocks with a high chemical content of Aluminum, Oxygen,\nSilicon, Calcium, Sodium and Iron, collectively known as felsic rocks. A classic example is\ngranite, which is the most common rock of the continental crust. The continental crust averages\nabout 20 miles in thickness (up to 60 miles thick for mountain ranges), allowing it to sit higher\n\u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 than the adjacent oceanic crust, which averages only 5 to 6 miles thick (thinner near ocean\ncenters and thicker towards the edges of oceans). Oceanic crust is composed of rocks like basalt,\nwhich has a high concentration of the elements Iron and Magnesium, with low concentrations of\nAluminum. These are collectively classified as mafic rocks. Areas of the earth\u2019s surface are\ncovered by a jig-saw puzzle arrangement of either Continental crust or Oceanic crust. These\n\u2018jig-saw\u2019 pieces are known as Lithospheric Plates or Tectonic Plates, and there are a total of\nabout 30 major plates on earth\u2019s surface.\nSo How Thick is the Earth\u2019s Crust?\nhttp:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/research\/structure\/crust\/index.php\nEarth\u2019s Crustal Thickness (km)\n\u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 At the bottom of the crust seismic waves increase their speed as they encounter a much denser\nlayer. This boundary layer between the crust and the Mantle is known as the Mohorovicic\nDiscontinuity or \u201cMoho\u201d and tells us that the layers below are much denser than the crust.\nThe following is courtesy of (http:\/\/mynasa.nasa.gov\/worldbook\/wbkids\/k_earth.html). Earth is covered with a rocky\n\"skin\" called the crust. The crust is about 5 miles (8 kilometers) thick under the oceans, and about 25 miles (40\nkilometers) thick under the continents. Inside Earth\nUnderneath the crust, Earth has three layers of hot rock and metal.\nThese layers are the mantle, the outer core, and the inner core. The\nmantle is a layer of hot, mostly solid rock below the crust. It is about\n1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick. The outer core lies beneath the\nmantle. It is made mostly of melted iron, and it is even hotter than the\nmantle. The inner core is the hottest part of Earth. Scientists believe\nthat the inner core is a ball of solid iron.\nThe Mantle is located immediately below the crust and Moho, extending to about 1800 miles\nbelow the surface of the earth. The mantle occupies over 80% of Earth\u2019s volume, and has a\nrather stable chemistry (high in Iron, Magnesium, Silicon, and Calcium, elements which would\neasily make the rock Peridotite (composed of the minerals pyroxene and olivine). The mantle is\ndivided into three major sections: the Uppermost Mantle, Asthenosphere, and Lower Mantle)\n- The Uppermost Mantle is solid and extends from the bottom of the crust to a depth of\napproximately 50 miles below earth\u2019s surface, deeper below continents and shallower near\nthe centers of oceans. The Uppermost mantle is composed of solid rock (dominated by\nolivine-pyroxene minerals) and together with the crust is referred to as \u201cLithosphere\u201d.\n(Image courtesy of USGS, http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/dynamic\/inside.html )\n\u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 - The Asthenosphere exists immediately below the lithosphere. The velocity of seismic\nwaves decreases rapidly as they enter the asthenosphere, and this, along with other evidence\nindicates this zone is plastic (between solid and liquid, like honey). This zone extends to a\ndepth of approximately 150-200 miles below the surface on average. This depth is shallower\nnear ocean centers and may extend to depths over 400 miles below the earth\u2019s surface in\nsome continental regions. The asthenosphere is hot due to the radioactive decay of elements,\nbut it\u2019s also under too much pressure to be liquid. It is convection within the asthenosphere\nthat drives plate tectonic motions. The Uppermost Mantle and the Asthenosphere are often\ngrouped together under the name \u201cUpper Mantle\u201d.\n- The Lower (Deep) Mantle extends from below the asthenosphere to a depth of\napproximately 1800 miles below the surface. This is the largest portion of the mantle, and\nalthough it is solid, evidence exists for slow but deliberate convective motion within this\nlayer too.\nThe Core of the earth is divided into two sections, the Outer Core and the Inner Core. The\nOuter Core is located approximately 1800-3100 miles below the surface. This layer is\ncomposed of heavier elements like Iron, Nickel and Sulfur and is so hot it represents earth\u2019s only\nliquid layer. As the molten Iron stirs in violent convective motions it generates the earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field.\nThe Inner Core is under so much pressure it cannot exist as a liquid, so this layer, extending\nfrom approximately 3100 miles to the center of the earth at 4,000 miles below the surface, is\ncompletely solid Iron, Nickel and Sulfur.\nEARTH\u2019S CRUSTAL MATERIALS\nOf all these layers the most important to us is the crust since we spend all our lives living on it.\nThere are numerous earth materials worthy of discussion, but let\u2019s explore the main earth\nmaterials here. Bedrock is consolidated (densely packed) rock found intact near the earth\u2019s\nsurface. Bedrock is most easily found in mountains where it has often been uplifted. All\nsurfaces of the crust are underlain by bedrock, but much of this bedrock is covered by layers of\nsoil and\/or sediment. At times the bedrock near the surface has been altered and weakened by\nchemical interactions with air or water. Bedrock in this weakened (weathered) state is much\neasier to break apart, and is often called regolith (broken rock).\nThree Major Rock Types ( Courtesy of USGS http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/visitors\/rocks_quiz.asp)\nThere are thousands of different rock types found within the crust, but we divide these into\nthree major groups based on how the rocks actually formed. These rock types are referred to\nas Igneous, Sedimentary and Metamorphic rocks.\n\u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Igneous rocks\nhttp:\/\/vulcan.wr.usgs.gov\/LivingWith\/VolcanicPast\/Notes\/igneous_rocks.html\nIgneous rocks are formed from molten rock that has cooled\nand solidified. There are two types of igneous rocks:\nIgneous Intrusive rocks form when magma deep below\nearth\u2019s surface cools and solidifies slowly. The slow cooling\nprocess allows crystals to grow from the molten liquid, and\nthe result is a coarse-grained rock. Igneous intrusive rocks\nare the dominant rocks within earth\u2019s crust, and the most\ncommon types include granite, diorite, and gabbro. The\nGranite\nsecond type of igneous rocks, known as Igneous Extrusive\nrocks, form when lava, glowing-hot cinders or ash cool\nrapidly on near the Earth's surface. Most of this material\n(73%) is produced in mid-ocean divergent boundaries, with\nlesser amounts produced at subduction zones (15%) and hot-\nspots (12%). The rapid cooling results in very small crystal\nsize and what are referred to as fine-grained rocks like basalt,\nrhyolite, andesite, pumice and obsidian.\nhttp:\/\/volcanoes.usgs.gov\/Imgs\/Gif\/Drawings\/RockClassif-B.gif\n\u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Sedimentary Rocks\nSedimentary rocks are formed close to the top of the crust,\neither in water or on land. They are formed when sediments\nare deposited in low spots called sedimentary basins, such as\nlakes, valleys, or ocean basins. The steady accumulation of\nlayer upon layer of sediments results in the lower sediments\nbeing cemented and compacted (lithified) together into a\nlayer of hard rock, The type of sedimentary rock that is\nformed depends on the original sediments being lithified. Black Shale\nThe most common sedimentary rock is Shale, made of\ncompacted\/cemented grains of tiny clay and silt. Other\nimportant sedimentary rocks include sandstone (made from\nlithified grains of sand), limestone (lithified calcium\ncarbonate shells) and conglomerate (lithified boulders,\ncobbles, gravel and sand).\nMetamorphic Rocks\nPre-existing rocks that are subjected to intense heat and\npressure often melt to become magma. However, sometimes\nthe heat and pressure are not enough to melt the rocks, and\ninstead they compress and warp the rocks into a different\nrock form known as metamorphic (changed form). Mineral\nmatter within the rocks are rearranged by the pressure and\nchemically altered by reactions with fluids that enter the\nrocks. Marble is a metamorphic rock formed when\nlimestone is exposed to intense pressure and heat. Quartzite\nis metamorphosed quartz sandstone. Schist and Slate are\nMarble\nexamples of medium-grade metamorphism of platy or fine-\ngrained rocks like Shale. Gneiss is a high-grade\nmetamorphic rock, one formed from pre-existing rocks\nsubjected to intense pressures deep inside the crust.\nEach of these three rock types can be transformed over\ngeologic time into other rock types. For instance, magma\ncan rise to the surface and solidify as an igneous extrusive\nrock. This rock material is then subjected to weathering and\nerosion, breaking the rock into gravel-sized sediment. The\nsediments are transported by water and pieces are chipped\naway along the journey, so that the sediment is only sand-\nsized when finally deposited into a low-lying geologic basin\nlike a sea or ocean. Over time, layer upon layer of new\nsediment builds on top of the lower layers, the added weight\ncrushing the sediments into layers of sedimentary rock like\n\u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 sandstone. The \u201cRock Cycle\u201d diagram illustrates the\npotential paths for the three main rock types as well as\nsediments and molten rock material.\nSediments are pieces of rock that have been physically and chemically removed from bedrock.\nThe process of breaking the bedrock into pieces of sediment is called weathering, while the\nremoval of the loose sediment away from the bedrock (by the movement of wind, water or ice) is\ncalled erosion. Sediments are classified by their size, and ranging from enormous boulders to\ntiny grains of clay the classification is boulder-cobble-gravel-sand-silt-clay. Once eroded from\nthe bedrock source, these sediments are transported downhill (often in flowing streams and\nrivers) away from high places and they are ultimately deposited in low-lying areas like oceans,\nlakes or valleys (collectively known as depositional basins). It is in these depositional basins that\nsediments can pile up over time creating layers of sediments that are thousands of feet thick.\nTephra (or pyroclasts) refers to solid fragments of rock ejected into the air during a volcanic\neruption. These range in size from tiny pieces of pulverized rock called ash to boulder-sized\nbombs. Once pyroclasts have fallen to the ground they remain as tephra unless hot enough to\nfuse together into pyroclastic rock, also known as tuff. Volcanic eruptions can also produce\nliquid (molten) rock. Magma is molten rock found under the surface of the earth, while Lava\nrefers to magma that escapes onto the surface.\nSoil is \u201crotten\u201d rock material that forms on top of sediment or bedrock. Soil forms best when the\nsurface of the rock material easily interacts with moisture, air, plant roots, and burrowing\norganisms. The more contact with each of these, the more readily the soil tends to form. For this\nreason, soils tend to form fastest in warm, moist environments with plenty of plant roots and\nburrowing insects providing channels for air and water to interact directly with the rock material.\nEven so, it takes hundreds or thousands of years for soils to fully develop, and in cold, dry\nenvironments it might take tens of thousands of years to develop a sizeable thickness of soil.\n\u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Soil development is highly dependent on the crustal materials it comes from, known as the\nparent material. For example, soils tend to form faster on sediments than they do on pure\nbedrock, as the sediments have lots of pathways for air and water to interact with the individual\nrock fragments. The type of rock making up the parent material will also influence the rate of\nsoil development. Soils tend to form more rapidly in porous rocks like basalt, while soils for\nextremely slowly on crystalline rock material such as granite.\nSo How Do We Ever See Sedimentary or Igneous Intrusive Rocks?\nSince igneous intrusive rocks and sedimentary rocks are formed deep inside the earth, how do we\never see rocks like granite or sandstone? The answer can be found by analyzing the diagram\nbelow.\nIt is clear to see that sediments are being deposited into a low-lying basin (a lake or sea) and that\nthe bottom layers are likely being compacted and cemented into sedimentary rocks, rocks too\ndeep for us to ever see them being formed. This diagram also shows high mountains in the\nbackground, mountains that are being worn down by the erosive forces of ice, water, and wind\n(aided by gravity). The river transports the eroded rock material from the mountains to the lake.\nAt first glance you might conclude that over time the lake will fill up with sediment being\ntransported along the river bed. Though this might indeed be true for some places on earth, it is\nnot true for most places. The reason is that earth is a dynamic place with a constant battle going\non between internal processes (tectonic forces, volcanic forces) that tend to make mountains\ngrow and force valleys down, and external process (weathering, erosion, mass wasting) which\n\u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 wear mountains down and fill valleys up with sediment. The mountains shown in the diagram\nare there for a reason; internal processes have lifted the mountains upward (and valleys\ndownwards) in fits-and-spurts over millions of years. The uplift occurs not continuously, but in\njarring earthquake motions every few centuries or so. Given enough time the mountains are\nuplifted thousands of feet, and at the same time these internal forces push the lake bottom\ndownwards.\nAt the same time, and on a continuous basis, external processes wear down the mountains as ice\nwidens the cracks in the rocky surfaces, water weakens the chemical bonds between the minerals\nwithin the rocks, and gravity helps pull the weakened pieces of rock down-slope. Water does\nmost of the work, and once the sediment has been transported into the stream it is the water that\ncarries or bounces the sediment down-stream towards the lake. The sediment bouncing along the\nriver bottom bangs into other pieces of rock, knocking sharp edges off, so that the sediment gets\ncontinually smaller and rounder in shape the longer it stays in the river channel. Finally, the\nsediment gets deposited into the lake, piling up over the years so that given time, enough weight\nis exerted to crush and cement together grains of sediment into sedimentary rocks.\nExternal forces change from day-to-day, while internal forces act sporadically over the millennia\nand can completely change their form over tens of millions of years. Forces that once created\ndeep valleys can reverse direction, uplifting lake bottoms to expose layers of sediment and\nsedimentary rock. In fact, the upper slopes of high mountains like the Himalayas contain\nfossilized shells of ancient organisms deposited on the bottom of shallow seas. How do you\nthink those fossilized shells got there?\n\u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 CH. 14 INTERNAL PROCESSES\nPlate Tectonics, Volcanism, Folding & Faulting\nhttp:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/aso\/tryit\/tectonics\/intro.html\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QBApevfNkkA\nPlate Tectonics refers to process of plate formation, movement,\nand destruction. Plate Tectonic Theory was proposed in the\n1960s, following almost 400 years of speculation,\nhypotheses, mapping, evidence collection, and technological\nadvances. New scientific theories were built upon earlier\nones in fits-and-spurts, and only by the 1960s, after we were\nable to survey the ocean depths, was a theory able to be\nformulated which compiled all the earlier information into a single\nparadigm known as the Theory of Plate Tectonics. In the 50 years\nsince the theory was first proposed, it has been constantly tested and\nrefined. The theory explains how earth\u2019s crust is formed, how it moves,\nand how our crust is continuously destroyed. In doing so, Plate\nTectonic Theory explains why we have frequent earthquakes in California;\nwhy we have volcanoes in places like Alaska, Japan, Iceland, and Hawaii; and why oceans are\nvery young compared to the continents.\nHere\u2019s a short list of some historical developments in developing the theory.\nAbraham Ortelius a 16th-century map maker, published his first\nmap of the world, Typus Orbis Terrarum (see right), in 1564.\nHis subsequent work, an atlas of the ancient and known world\nThesaurus geographicus published in 1587 and again expanded\nin 1596, was the first known work to suggest the coastline of\nAmericas fits like a puzzle with the coastlines of Western\nEurope and Africa. He suggested that the coastline of the\nAmericas must have been \"torn away from Europe & Africa by\nearthquakes and floods\".\nFew took Ortelius seriously, though several important people\nwho did consider his ideas include Theodor Christoph Lilienthal\nin 1756, Alexander von Humboldt in both1801 and 1845, and\nAntonio Snider-Pellegrini in1858. Accurate mapping of the\ncoastlines of North and South America over the previous century\nallowed Snider-Pellegrini to show how clear of a jigsaw-puzzle\nfit could be made by juxtaposing the coastlines onto a single\nmap, as shown to the right.\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 .\nAlfred Wegener, a German meteorologist,\nproposed his initial theory of Continental\nDrift at a conference in January of 1912.\nThis theory suggested that a supercontinent\ncalled \u2018Urkontinent\u2019 (German for\ncontinental origin) existed in the geologic\npast, that the supercontinent subsequently\nbroke up, with the continental fragments\n\u2018drifting\u2019 away from each other over time.\nThis \u2018supercontinent\u2019 would later be re-\nnamed \u2018Pangaea\u2019 (meaning all earth) by the\nscientific community. Wegener\u2019s evidence\nincluded the fit of continental coastlines,\nand the distribution and orientation of rock\nformations (along with their fossil\nevidence) on opposite sides of ocean basins. Image: http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/dynamic\/continents.html\nAfter extensive field work in Greenland followed by detailed research, Wegener published the\ntheory in The Origin of Continents and Oceans (Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane) in\n1915. He expanded his ideas in subsequent editions until his death while performing research on\nthe Greenland ice sheet in 1930.\nWegener\u2019s work wasn\u2019t published in English until 1922, with a US printing in 1925. His ideas\nsparked fierce debate in the scientific community, and the theory never caught on during\nWegener\u2019s lifetime. He was quite literally laughed off stage when presenting his ideas. The\nmain problem with Continental Drift was that there was no viable mechanism for the \u201cdrift\u201d.\nWegener had proposed that the driving force might be the centrifugal force created by earth\u2019s\nrotation but this force proved mathematically too weak to be the driving mechanism. One\nprominent scientist who did take Wegener seriously was Arthur Holmes.\nArthur Holmes, a British Geology professor, was open enough to new ideas that he took\nWegener\u2019s ideas seriously, and he conceived a viable mechanism. Holmes\u2019 early work focused\non the radioactive decay of earth materials, with the goal being to accurately determine the age\nof the earth. His familiarity with the radioactive decay of rocks led to him to the idea that the\nheat released from these materials inside the earth might be sufficient to promote thermal\nconvection in the mantle, which in turn could rip ocean basins apart and push continents to the\nside. If true, this would be the driving force that Wegener\u2019s theory lacked. Still, evidence was\nneeded to show that mantle convection was occurring, but much of this evidence was under\nthousands of feet of sea water.\nHarry H. Hess was a Geology professor at Princeton University but\nduring World War II he was the captain of a US Navy transport ship\nequipped with sonar. Using the echo-sounding sonar device Hess\nwas able to map profiles of the Pacific Ocean\u2019s depths. He noted\nextremely deep areas near the Marianas Islands and unusual flat-\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 topped undersea mountains strewn across the Pacific, which are now known as Guyots. After\nthe war Hess continued his research, leading him to the idea of Sea Floor Spreading, where\nconvective cells within the mantle allow the oceans to rift (split apart), creating a chain of\nvolcanoes rising from the ocean bottom, some of them poking out above the sea surface to form\nislands. As the spreading continues over time, the older volcanoes are carried away in a mirror-\nimage pattern on either side of the rift zone. As the older volcanoes move away from the rift\nzone, they sink lower in elevation as they both contract thermally and are subjected to\nweathering and erosion. Some of these island volcanoes are worn flat by wave action before\nsinking below the waves, creating the unique Guyots which had earlier sparked Hess\u2019 curiosity.\nAn initial reaction to Hess\u2019 idea was that since new crust is being formed at the mid-ocean rift\nzones, the earth must be expanding in size like an inflating balloon. It was later argued that this\nis not the case, that crustal materials (plus upper mantle, together making a lithospheric plate) are\nindeed being created at rift zones, but that the lithospheric plates are being transported in a\nconveyor-like manner on top of mantle convection cells, and are ultimately destroyed when they\nare forced back down into the mantle at the edges of (some) oceans.\nStill, more evidence was needed to convince the bulk of the scientific community that the ideas\nproposed as Continental Drift, mantle Convection, and Sea Floor Spreading were valid. The\nremaining evidence was to come from exploration of the nature of earth\u2019s ocean basins. This\nmakes sense as the oceans comprise over 70% of earth\u2019s total surface4, and they represent the\nareas with the thinnest crust, so evidence of crust being created, moved, or destroyed would be\neasier to observe under the oceans.\nThe first evidence came from a World War II technology used by aircraft to detect the presence\nsubmarines in the ocean. The device is called a magnetometer, and it has the ability to detect\nslight disturbances in the earth\u2019s magnetic field caused by the presence of large objects made of\niron or steel, such as submarines, or by natural variations in the orientation or strength of earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field (see http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/dynamic\/stripes.html). Obviously, these devices\nwere used for military purposes during the war, but starting in the\n1950s they were used to map out the magnetic fields of earth\u2019s\nocean bottoms, which resulted in a mirror-image, zebra-\nstrip pattern of magnetic variations on either side of the\nworld\u2019s oceanic rift zones. It was concluded that since\nbasalt is the most common oceanic crustal rock, and\nsince basalt contains lots of magnetite and other iron-\nrich minerals, basalt has magnetic properties that can\nsignificantly influence the earth\u2019s magnetic field in the\nocean basins.\nIn fact, when basaltic lava cools and crystallizes into basaltic rock, the magnetic minerals align\nthemselves with the earth\u2019s magnetic north pole, locking into the rocks evidence of the\norientation of earth\u2019s magnetic field. Turns out that earth\u2019s magnetic poles reverse direction on\nan irregular pattern with a frequency ranging from about 100,000 years to 1 million years. In\nessence, the North Magnetic Pole becomes the South Magnetic Pole, and vice versa, with the\nreversal taking a few thousand years to complete. By the early 1960s it was finally recognized\nthat the \u2018zebra-strip\u2019 patterns recorded by the magnetometers showed the historical record of\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 these magnetic field reversals, which were an exact mirror-image pattern on both sides of the\nmid-oceanic rift zones.\nThe idea of Sea Floor Spreading now attracted the attention of many scientists, but one more\npiece of evidence was needed to complete the puzzle\nthat Ortelius began to sort out almost 400 years\nearlier. By the 1960s the search for oil had moved\noffshore, so oil exploration companies built ships\ncapable of drilling from an oil platform mounted on\nan ocean-going ship. This technology was adapted to\nresearch vessels, the first of which was the Glomar\nChallenger, which in 1968 set off on a year-long\nmission to drill and collect samples of the Atlantic\nOcean\u2019s sediments and underlying bedrock.\nImage: http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/dynamic\/glomar.html\nRadioactive isotope dating of the basaltic bedrock samples confirmed what many scientists now\nalready believed, that the age of the bedrock was progressively older with distance from the Mid-\nAtlantic Ridge (the Atlantic\u2019s mid-ocean rift zone). The result was an overwhelming acceptance\nof a whole new paradigm in geosciences called Plate Tectonic Theory. The theory combines the\nideas of Wegener\u2019s Continental Drift, Holmes\u2019 Mantle Convection, Hess\u2019 Sea Floor Spreading\nand the newest available data of magnetic striping and radiometric dating of the ocean floor\nbasalts into a single, unified theory.\nSO WHAT EXACTLY DOES PLATE TECTONIC THEORY TELL US?\nPlate Tectonic Theory or just plain \u201cPlate Tectonics\u2019 explains not only how Lithospheric Plates\nof Crust and Uppermost Mantle are created, moved and destroyed, the theory also explains why\nthere are active, explosive volcanoes in places like Japan and Peru, why California is subjected\nto frequent major earthquakes, why the Big island of Hawaii is home to large, non-explosive\nvolcanoes, and why the middle of the oceans contain large undersea chains of volcanoes. He\ntheory explains why the rocks of the ocean basins range in age from today to less than 200\nmillion years old, while the rocks of the continents can be 20 times older still. The theory is\nconstantly being put to the test and refined, and the following section describes what we know\ntoday.\nNature of Lithospheric Plates\nThe outer, solid layer of the earth is known as the lithosphere, which is composed of crust (both\noceanic and continental) as well as the underlying uppermost mantle, which is also solid. The\nlithosphere covers the planet much like an eggshell covers the yolk and white of an egg. Unlike\nan eggshell, the lithosphere is broken up into multiple sections of various sizes called\nlithospheric plates, tectonic plates, or sometimes just plates. There are about 25 plates, seven\nof which are very large including the Pacific, Antarctic, North American and Eurasian Plates.\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Map of Tectonic Plates. http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/dynamic\/slabs.html\nTectonic Plates average about 40 miles in thickness but their thickness varies considerably from\nless than 10 miles near mid-ocean rift zones to over 100 miles for very old continental interiors.\nThe following map shows the thickness of the earth\u2019s crust in kilometers (1km = 0.62 mile). The\nmap doesn\u2019t include the uppermost mantle, which is very thin near mid-ocean ridges and gets\nconsiderable thicker with distance from these rift zones.\nImage courtesy of USGS (http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/research\/structure\/crust\/index.php)\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 The lithospheric plates ride on convections cells within the underlying asthenosphere, and it\nappears that the plate motion is driven by both the \u2018push\u2019 factor of the spreading rift zone as well\nas the gravitational \u2018slab pull\u2019 of dense lithosphere being drawn downwards at the descending\nportion of the mantle convection cell. It also appears that the size of the plate depends in part on\nthe size of the convection cell. The direction and rate of speed that the lithospheric plates move\nacross the surface of the earth is dependent upon the horizontal direction of the underlying\nconvection cell as well as interactions with other lithospheric plates as they bump and grind into,\naway from, or past each other. Plate motions range in speed from almost 0 to over 4 inches per\nyear in parts of the Pacific Ocean. The following map from JPL shows the current relative\nmotion of earth\u2019s plates.\nIt is at the edges of plates (called Plate Boundaries) where most of the action takes place,\nincluding most of the planet\u2019s earthquakes\nand volcanoes. While new ocean\nlithosphere is being created at mid-ocean\nrift zones and then carried horizontally by\nmantle convection, an equal volume of\nlithosphere is being consumed (destroyed)\nat plate boundaries on the edges of many\noceans. This way, the earth is not\nexpanding in size, as equal amounts of\nlithosphere are being created and destroyed.\nThe lithosphere is basically being recycled\non a continuous basis.\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 PLATE BOUNDARIES\nhttp:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/dynamic\/understanding.html\nThere are three main types of plate boundaries identified as convergent, divergent, and transform\nboundaries. There is a fourth type of boundary called Plate Boundary Zone where the plate\nboundaries are either not clearly defined or too complex to assign as either convergent, divergent\nor transform.\nDivergent Plate Boundaries\nDivergent boundaries occur along rift zones, where the lithosphere cracks open and plates are\nmove away from each other. The gap created by the rifting motion allows magma to rise to the\nexposed surface as lava, where is crystallizes into brand-new crust. Since these rift zones are\nassociated with rising, hot magma, they typically lift the new crust into the form of an undersea\nvolcanic chain stretching thousands of miles in length. Examples of divergent boundaries\ninclude the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and East Pacific Rise, each\njust a part of a global system of mid-ocean ridges encircling\nthe planet\u2019s ocean basins like stitches on the outer skin of a\nbaseball. The rate of divergence is quite slow, on the order\nof just an inch or two per year, but this motion over the past\n200 million years has allowed the Atlantic Ocean to grow\nfrom a long, thin crack in the earth into the world\u2019s second\nlargest ocean, steadily pushing the North and South\nAmerican continents away from the western coastlines of\nAfrica and Eurasia. The tops of the undersea volcanoes of\nthe Mid-Atlantic Ridge push up above sea level every now-\nand-then, yielding volcanically active islands in the middle\nof the Atlantic such as the Azores and Iceland. It is entirely\npossible to visit Iceland and stand on the eastern edge of the North American plate and gently\ntoss a stone over to the western edge of the Eurasian plate.\nConvergent Plate Boundaries\nThe second type is the Convergent Plate Boundary, where lithospheric plates are forced towards\n(into) each other. Since we have two main types of lithosphere (containing either continental or\noceanic crust) there are three individual types of convergent boundaries:\n\u2022 Continental-Continental Convergence occurs when two plates containing continental\ncrust slam into one another. This often results in\nthe crumpling (upwards and downwards) of the\nimpact boundary, leading to the formation of\nhigh mountains like the Himalayas, thrust to\ngreat heights when the Indian sub-continent\nslammed into Eurasia. Though this impact\ncommenced some 60 million years ago and\nthe leading edge has crumpled, the trailing\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 edge of the Indian sub-continent still inches forward, so the upward thrust of the\nHimalayas is by no means complete as is evidenced by the frequent, large earthquakes in\nparts of India, China, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Check out this PBS\/NOVA animation\nshowing the formation of the Himalayas (http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/nova\/everest\/earth\/birth.html)\n\u2022 Oceanic-Continental Convergence occurs when a lithospheric plate containing oceanic\ncrust is forced into and subducted below (forced under) the edge of a plate containing\ncontinental crust. The oceanic lithospheric plate is the one subducted because it is denser\nthan the continental crust. As the oceanic crust subducts it creates a very deep depression\nknown as an oceanic trench. These oceanic\ntrenches act as depositional basins for sediment\neroded from the adjacent continent, so they do\nnot tend to be as deep as they could be. As\nthe subduction process continues, the\nlithospheric plate descends at a mild angle\ninto the hot mantle lying below the continent,\ndragging sediment and seawater along with\nit. As this material heats up it partially melts,\ncreating a steady supply of magma which rises upwards through the continental\nlithosphere where (depending on its temperature and chemistry and the thickness of the\nlithosphere) it either solidifies within the continental crust as igneous intrusive rocks or\nextrudes as lava, cinder and ash on the surface, forming a chain of volcanoes known as a\nvolcanic arc. The best examples of this are the volcanic arcs on the west coasts of North\nAmerica\u2019s Cascade Range running from Northern California to British Columbia, and\nSouth America\u2019s Andes, running from Argentina and Chile to Peru, Ecuador and\nColombia. These two continents are slowly moving westward, over-riding and\nsubducting the Nazca, Cocos, and Juan de Fuca plates, the remnants of what once\nunderlay most of the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\u2022 Oceanic-Oceanic Convergence occurs when two lithosphere plates with oceanic crust are\nforced towards each other. This appears to occur most when an oceanic plate converges\nwith a continent, which in this case acts as a\nblock. At first, the thin, dense oceanic\nlithosphere tends to bow downwards but in\nthis case, a break develops offshore within\na weak area of the oceanic crust. The\nresult is subduction of oceanic lithosphere\nbelow similar oceanic lithosphere at the\nbreak point, which in this case is an\nextremely deep oceanic trench. The\nsubducting slab drags water along with it into the mantle, and the resulting partial melting\nrises to the surface to produce a line of undersea volcanoes and volcanic islands known as\nisland arcs. Classic examples of island arcs include the islands of Indonesia, the\nPhilippines, Japan, and the Caribbean. In each of these cases we see (in order) a\ncontinent, a shallow sea, a volcanic arc, a deep oceanic trench, and finally the deep ocean\nabyssal plain. In some parts of the world including the Marianas Islands in the eastern\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Pacific, we see evidence that two separate breakpoints occurred with one area of oceanic-\noceanic convergence, producing two separate subduction zones and two island arcs.\nIt should be noted that while only oceanic-oceanic and oceanic-continental convergence are\nassociated with subduction and volcanic activity, all three types of convergent plate boundaries\nare associated with earthquakes. Significant earthquakes occur whenever tectonic plates move\nrelative to one another, and some of the largest earthquakes ever recorded have been from\noceanic-oceanic and oceanic-continental convergence, including the Magnitude 9.1 December\n26, 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake that struck off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is\nat these plate boundaries, those involving subduction, where oceanic crust is destroyed as gravity\npulls the descending plate into the hot mantle.\nTransform Plate Boundaries\nThe third type of plate boundary is the Transform Plate\nBoundary, where lithospheric plates slide laterally past\none other. Friction between the rocks on either side of\nthe plate boundary prevents these plates from sliding\nsmoothly past one another. Instead, the forces build up\nover time until the rocks can no longer hold back the\nbuilt-up pressures and the plates bump-and-grind past\neach other. Several minutes of chaos results with the\nplates often moving sideways tens of feet during the\nassociated earthquake. The classic example of a\nTransform Plate Boundary is California\u2019s San Andreas\nFault, marking the boundary of the North American and\nPacific Plates. The North American Plate is moving\nwest-southwest, while the Pacific Plate is moving\nnorthwest. The relative motion between these two\nplates gives the appearance that the Pacific Plate (and\neverything on it including the cities of Los Angeles and\nSan Francisco) is moving north compared to the rest of\nNorth America located east of the fault. The San\nAndreas Fault unleashed enormous built-up energy during the estimated 8.3-Magnitude San\nFrancisco Earthquake of 1906. The Southern section of the San Andreas Fault, that portion\nlocated closest to Los Angeles, last ruptured in 1857. Recent evidence suggests that this portion\nof the fault has produced a strong earthquake approximately every 88 years over the past several\nhundred years, so Los Angeles is overdue for a large earthquake. In order to be better prepared,\nplease spend a few minutes and check out FEMA\u2019s earthquake preparedness site at\nhttp:\/\/www.ready.gov\/earthquakes\nBy analyzing the dynamics of plate boundaries we\u2019ve been able to see why Iceland is\nvolcanically active, why the Atlantic Ocean is growing in size, why California is subjected to\nlarge earthquakes, and why places like Japan, Indonesia, Chile and Peru experience both\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 earthquakes and volcanic activity. All of these can be explained by the dynamics of plate\nboundaries, but how does Plate Tectonics explain volcanic activity in the centers of plates?\nHOT SPOTS\nThere are places on earth which experience volcanic activity, yet they are located thousands of\nmiles from a plate boundary. A classic example of this is the Hawaiian islands, which are\nentirely of volcanic origin yet are have located over 2,000 miles from the closest tectonic plate\nboundary. The Hawaiian Islands stretch in a rather straight 300-mile line from the Big Island of\nHawaii, with its active volcanoes of Kilauea and Mauna Loa, northwest to the islands of Maui\n(with evidence of volcanic activity as recent as 1 million years ago), Molokai, Oahu, and finally\nKauai, which has not been volcanically active for over 5 million years. The line of extinct\nundersea volcanoes and volcanic islands extends beyond the political borders of Hawaii to\ninclude the Emperor Seamounts and even Midway Island, some 1,200 miles northwest of\nHawaii\u2019s active volcanoes.\nThe mystery of how these volcanic islands came to be was uncovered in 1963 by a Canadian\ngeologist by the name of J. Tuzo Wilson, who reasoned that semi-stationary hotspots located\nwithin the mantle partially melt the lower portion of lithosphere located directly above it. This\npartial melting produces a steady, long-lasting supply of magma which upwells to the surface,\nburning its way through the Pacific Ocean lithosphere, creating volcanic islands (or underwater\nseamounts) growing from the on the ocean floor of the Pacific. As the lithospheric plate rides\nover the mantle hotspot, the volcanic islands that formed on the ocean bottom become\nincreasingly detached from\nthe upwelling magma plume,\nand when a threshold has\nbeen exceeded, the magma\nplume changes course and\nbegins to build a brand new\nundersea volcano. In the\nHawaiian Islands, it is the Big\nIsland of Hawaii that\ncurrently over the hotspot,\nwhich is actively supplying\nmagma to the island\u2019s\nvolcanoes. The island of\nKauai was located\nimmediately above this same\nhot spot 5 million years ago,\nand has since ridden on its\nlithospheric conveyor belt\n300 miles to the northwest\nand its volcanoes are\nconsidered long extinct.\nDiagram courtesy of USGS: http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/imap\/2800\/\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Hotspots occur throughout the earth\u2019s oceans including the Galapagos Hotspot, which formed\nthe namesake Islands, and the Society Hotspot, responsible for the creation of the island of\nTahiti. They even occur under the continents but are harder to observe the effects there. A\nclassic example is the hotspot located under Yellowstone National Park which produces the\nfamous hot springs and geysers along with periodic cataclysmic volcanic eruptions, since the\nhotspot produces a more viscous, explosive magma when located under a continent. The last\nlava flow in Yellowstone occurred approximately 70,000 years ago, with the last major\n\u2018supervolcanic\u2019 Yellowstone eruption occurring about 640,000 years ago.\nMap of Global Hotspots courtesy of USGS: http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/dynamic\/world_map.html\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 VOLCANIC FEATURES\nhttp:\/\/edc2.usgs.gov\/pubslists\/teachers-packets\/volcanoes\/poster\/poster.php\nWithin the earth\u2019s mantle rock material is constantly being melted into magma. Since this\nmagma is less dense than the surrounding mantle rocks it rises as a magma plume through the\nlithosphere and accumulates in a reservoir of magma known as a magma chamber. At times,\nthe magma solidifies underground, crystallizing into igneous intrusive rocks. However,\nsometimes the magma finds its way upward through cracks, fissures and vents, finally extruded\nin a heated rush of lava or violently erupted as gas, lava and tephra (airborne fragments) from the\nearth\u2019s surface; a volcano is born as a cone-shaped feature made of layers of lava and ash.\nVolcano Life Stage: Erupting, Active, Dormant or Extinct\nOver the years the terms active, dormant and extinct have taken on a whole set of meanings, so\nlet\u2019s cut to the chase and define the life stage of a volcano in modern scientific terms. A volcano\nis considered to be erupting if it is actively extruding tephra or volcanic gas, or showing signs of\nincreasingly shallow earthquakes.\nA volcano doesn\u2019t have to be erupting to be considered active. Any volcano is considered to be\nactive if it has erupted with the last 10,000 years. This may seem like a long time, but in\ngeologic terms 10,000 years passes in the blink of an eye, and some volcanoes only erupt once\nevery million years or more. The volcanoes of Yellowstone National park erupt in a regular\npattern about every 700,000 years, and they last erupted 640,000 years ago. These volcanoes\nwould be considered dormant since if they haven\u2019t erupted in the last 10,000 years, but the\ntectonic forces that produce the magma source for the volcano are still ongoing. Human life-\ntimes often make for a false sense of security when it comes to volcanoes. The Romans\nconsidered Vesuvius to no longer be a threat before its catastrophic eruption of 79 CE destroyed\nthe city Pompeii. As you can tell, it\u2019s often difficult to distinguish an extinct volcano from\na dormant volcano.\nExtinct volcanoes are those which are unlikely to ever erupt again because the tectonic forces\nthat once supplied magma to the volcano are no longer active. The Hawaiian Islands to the\nnorthwest of the Big Island are classic examples of extinct volcanoes because they have moved\naway from the underlying hotspot, the supply source for their magma. These islands will not see\nvolcanic activity again, so you have to visit the Big Island of Hawaii if you want to observe\nvolcanic activity in Hawaii.\nTypes of Volcanic Eruptions: Effusive & Explosive\nhttp:\/\/edc2.usgs.gov\/pubslists\/teachers-packets\/volcanoes\/lesson1\/lesson1.php\nVolcanic eruptions are divided into two main categories; explosive and effusive. As the name\nimplies, explosive eruptions tend to be volatile and dangerous in nature. The main reason for\nthis is that the magma and lava feeding explosive volcanoes is viscous (sticky), which tends to\ntrap gases inside the magma. Since the gases cannot easily escape, pressure builds inside the\nmagma until the volcano blows its top in a violent eruption. As the volcano erupts the sudden\nrelease of pressure blasts super-heated gases, lava, and pulverized rock into the air. These\nairborne fragments are called tephra, and can range in size from fine ash particles to enormous\nboulders (called bombs if still semi-liquid). The initial violent eruption is often followed by less-\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 explosive lava flows. Explosive eruptions can release enormous quantities of tephra, lava, and\ngases, including carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, and water vapor.\nWhat makes explosive volcanoes so deadly is the combination of tephra and gravity. Thick\nclouds of super-heated ash and gas can race down mountains at incredible speeds, incinerating\neverything in their path. Volcanic ash falls back to earth\u2019s surface, accumulating in thick layers\nof that can suffocate and bury people, animals and plants. Thick ash layers can build up on\nrooftops which can collapse from the weight, especially if combined with the weight of water if\nheavy rainfall follows an eruption. Lastly, the heat and tephra from an eruption can melt the\nsnowpack on the high slopes of a volcano, or mix with fast-flowing rivers to create a deadly\nvolcanic mudflow known as a lahar. Lahars can bury entire villages on the lower slopes of the\nvolcanoes.\nExplosive eruptions are further divided based on the intensity of the eruption and the amount of\nash and lava produced by the eruption, with names indicative of historical examples. These\ninclude Strombolian, Vulcanian, Pelean, and the most catastrophic, the Plinian eruption.\nOn the other hand, effusive eruptions are not normally explosive, and are instead associated\nwith fluid lava that flows like hot honey from a volcanic fissure, vent, or crater. Fluid lavas\nallow the trapped gases to escape easily, so they do not allow gas pressures to build up to\nexplosive levels. This is not to say that gases aren\u2019t released, as water vapor and carbon dioxide\nare always released during effusive eruptions, it\u2019s just that these gases aren\u2019t pressurized like\nthey are in explosive eruptions. Effusive eruptions are also divided into categories based on\nfamous examples, including Hawaiian-type eruptions and Icelandic-type eruptions.\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 http:\/\/edc2.usgs.gov\/pubslists\/teachers-packets\/volcanoes\/poster\/poster.php#posterfig5\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 TYPES OF VOLCANOES http:\/\/edc2.usgs.gov\/pubslists\/teachers-packets\/volcanoes\/lesson1\/lesson1.php\nThough every volcano has unique characteristics based largely on the chemistry and temperature\nof the magma, volcanoes can be assigned to one of five basic types known as shield volcanoes,\ncomposite volcanoes, cinder cones, lava domes and calderas.\nShield volcanoes, like Kilauea in Hawaii, form by\neffusive eruptions of layer-upon-layer of fluid,\nbasaltic lava. The hot, fluid lava runs down the\ngently-sloping volcanic slope for many miles\nbefore solidifying, so these volcanoes do not tend\nto have steep slopes. Instead, the gently-sloping\nvolcanic shape resembles a warrior's shield.\nShield volcanoes can erupt from a central vent or\nfrom cracks along the slope of the volcano known\nas fissures.\nHawaii\u2019s fissure eruptions (http:\/\/volcanoes.usgs.gov\/images\/pglossary\/fissure.php) can extrude\nvast quantities of basaltic lava which can\nblanket the landscape in what are referred\nto as flood basalts. These basaltic lavas\ncome in three main varieties. Pahoehoe\nis basaltic lava that has a smooth, lobed\nsurface. When pahoehoe solidifies it is\neasy to walk on, though you can still hear\nthe cracking of the new rock beneath\nyour feet as you walk on it.\nPhoto: Kilauea Fissure Eruption.\nhttp:\/\/volcanoes.usgs.gov\/Imgs\/Jpg\/Kilauea\/32512553-001_large.jpg\nThe second type of\nbasaltic flow from\nfissures is called `A`a\n(pronounced \"ah-ah\"),\na lava flow with a\nrough, broken, angular\nsurface, making\nwalking very difficult.\n`A`a lava flow, Kilauea.\nPahoehoe flow, Kilauea\nPhotos: USGS http:\/\/volcanoes.usgs.gov\/Imgs\/Jpg\/Photoglossary\/aa_large.jpg\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 The third type of Hawaiian basaltic flow is\ncalled Pillow Basalt. These lavas take on the\nlobed shape of pillows as the lava is extruded\ndirectly into the ocean water (they also form\nwhen lava is extruded into ice as in Iceland).\nAs the outer surface of the lava instantly\ncools it forms a basaltic shell. The inner\nportion remains liquid and as the flow\nprogresses, lava squeezes out of the shell to\nform a new encrusted lobe. The process goes\non and on, forming vast volumes of basalt\nthat resemble gray-black pillows.\nPhoto:\nhttp:\/\/www.photolib.noaa.gov\/bigs\/nur05018.jpg\nNote: For more viscous fissure eruptions involving silica-rich lava like that of rhyolite, there is an additional type of\nflow called blocky. Here, the lava breaks into large blocks measuring several feet in diameter.\nComposite Volcanoes (or Stratovolcanoes) are steep-sided, cone-shaped features built from\nexplosive eruptions that are followed by extrusions of effusive lava. The result is that composite\nvolcanoes are composed of alternating layers of ash and cinders with silica-rich extrusive rocks\nwhich solidified from viscous lava. These are extremely explosive features due to the viscous\nnature of the magma feeding them. The Cascade Range, running from Northern California to\nWashington State and continuing to British Columbia, contains many active composite\nvolcanoes including Mt. Shasta, Mt. Lassen, Mt. Baker, Mt. Rainier, and the infamous Mt. St.\nHelens, which erupted violently in May of 1980 (see below).\nMount St. Helens BEFORE the 1980 eruption.\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Mount St. Helens DURING the May, 1980 eruption\nAFTER the eruption\nPhotos: http:\/\/edc2.usgs.gov\/pubslists\/teachers-packets\/volcanoes\/poster\/poster.php#posterfig5\nVolcanoes of the Cascade Range (Mainland US including California)\nhttp:\/\/edc2.usgs.gov\/pubslists\/teachers-packets\/volcanoes\/lesson6\/lesson6.php\nList of US Volcanoes by region: http:\/\/volcanoes.usgs.gov\/about\/volcanoes\/region\/index.php\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Cinder Cones http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/volc\/types.html\nCinder cones are relatively small, cone-shaped, explosive volcanic features. In many ways they\nresemble a true volcano, but they lack significant internal layers of solidified lava required of\ntrue volcanoes. Cinder cones form when very viscous lava is erupted in an explosive burst,\nsending blobs of lava into the air where it breaks into small fragments and cools rapidly into fine\nash and coarser cinders. The ash is carried by the wind, while the heavier cinders fall back to\nearth around the central vent, creating a cone of cinders that have welded themselves together\nunder the tremendous heat. Some cinder cone eruptions are followed by effusive lava flows, but\nthe volume of cinders far outweighs that of lava.\nMost cinder cones have a depressed, circular\ncrater at the summit and most cinder cones\nrise only a few hundred feet above the\nnearby landscape. Cinder cones are common\nin California\u2019s Owens Valley. Red Hill,\nlocated near the Owens Valley town of Coso\nJunction, about half-way between Los\nAngeles and Mammoth Lakes, is a classic\ncinder cone reddened by the oxidation of its\niron-rich minerals.\nA famous cinder cone began to grow from a small vent on a farm near the village of Par\u00edcutin,\nMexico In 1943. By the early 1950s it had built itself into a 1,200-foot high cone, with ash\ncovering about 100 square miles having destroyed the nearby towns.\nLava Domes http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/volc\/types.html\nLava domes form from very viscous,\nsilica-rich lava which is too \u2018sticky\u2019 to\nflow, so the lava piles up within a\nvolcanic crater or around a volcanic vent.\nLava domes grow slowly over months and\nyears, often splitting open, sending pieces\nof the outer, solidified shell tumbling\ndown its slopes.\nCalderas: http:\/\/volcanoes.usgs.gov\/images\/pglossary\/caldera.php\nA caldera is a collapsed volcano, formed when the\nshallow magma chamber of a large stratovolcano\nempties rapidly, usually because of a large\nexplosive eruption. The weakened walls of the\nstratovolcano crumble into the evacuated magma\nchamber, creating a circular depression ringing the\nformer volcano\u2019s summit. Calderas are much\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 larger than volcanic craters, which are formed by the blasting away of rock at the peak of the\nvolcano during eruptions.\nPhoto: Santorini Caldera, Greece.

The index is logarithmic, so each step up in category represents a ten-fold increase in\nexplosivity, The VEI is calculated using several factors including the volume of erupted tephra,\nthe maximum height of ash column, and the duration of the eruption.\nThe figure to the right shows the volumes of several\nkey explosive eruptions and their corresponding\nVEI. The numbers in parentheses represent total\nvolume of uncompacted erupted tephra, ash, and\npyroclastic flows ejected by the eruption.\nThe figure shows that the eruption of California\u2019s\nLong Valley Caldera (near Mammoth Lakes) some\n760,000 years ago had a VEI of 7 and a volume of\n600 km3 of material. Larger still was the explosive\neruption at Yellowstone about 600,000 years ago\nwith a VEI of 8 and a volume of about 1,000 km3 of\npyroclastic material from the volcano.\nHere\u2019s another way of showing the volume of ash\nejected during selected eruptions.

Lahars travel in existing river and stream\nnetworks at such speeds that they destroy everything in their path including bridges, houses,\nand entire towns. In 1985, lahars at Nevado del Ruiz volcano, Colombia, killed over 23,000\npeople. These deadly flows can travel many miles from the volcano itself, leaving a path of\ndestruction along its way.\nTephra (airborne ash and coarser debris) is composed of tiny fragments of volcanic rock\nblasted into the atmosphere. Tephra falling back to the ground can build up in such thick\nlayers it causes roofs to collapse, especially when accompanied by rainfall. Tephra can also\nendanger the lives of people with respiratory problems. It can clog machinery, including\naircraft engines. In April of 2010 tephra from an Icelandic volcano was responsible for\ngrounding Western Europe\u2019s entire fleet of commercial aircraft for over a week.\nPyroclastic flows are hot, glowing clouds of tephra and super-heated gas that can travel at\nover 100 miles per hour down the slopes of volcanoes, incinerating all objects and people in\ntheir path. Pyroclastic flows at Mount Unzen, Japan, in June, 1991, killed 43 people including\nworld-renowned volcanologists Maurice and Katia Kraft.\nCheck out dsc.discovery.com\/videos\/ultimate-guide-to-volcanoes-pyroclastic-flow.html\nLava flows are usually slow-moving or largely confined to predictable paths, so they don\u2019t\noften prove to be deadly to humans. However, volcanoes can erupt for decades at a time, with\nlava destroying anything in its path. Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea has erupted almost continuously since\n1983, with lava flows destroying the village of Kalapana in 1991.\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 PLUTONIC INTRUSIONS AND INTRUSIVE FEATURES:\nhttp:\/\/vulcan.wr.usgs.gov\/LivingWith\/VolcanicPast\/Notes\/plutons.html\nMagma rising through the lithosphere may run out of energy before reaching the surface, in\nwhich case the magma can solidify within the crust as a mass of igneous intrusive rock known as\na pluton or igneous intrusion. Igneous intrusions come in all shape and sizes since the magma\nthat forms these plutons can rise on the order of just weeks, or for tens of millions of years.\nSome common forms include batholiths, laccoliths, stocks, dikes and sills.\nEnormous igneous intrusions which cover an area of at\nleast 40 square miles at the surface of the earth are\ncalled a batholith. The size of the pluton may be\nmuch greater under the ground but it is the area exposed\nat the surface which is used to determine the type of\nintrusion. We never see batholiths form as this occurs\ndeep inside the crust, but subsequent uplift can bring\nthem to the surface where they often make up the cores\nof major mountain ranges including California\u2019s Sierra\nNevada, San Gabriel, and San Bernardino Mountains.\nA laccolith or Dome Mountain is a shallow igneous\nintrusion that is emplaced below sedimentary bedrock\nformations, pushing them into a raised dome. The\nmagma crystallizes underground as granitic or dioritic\nrocks which then form the core of the dome mountain.\nLaccoliths tend to have rather flat bottoms and a\nmushroom-shaped head. The Henry Mountains of Utah\nare famous for their laccoliths, but this one from\nMontana shows a true dome shape since the overlying\nsedimentary rock has eroded away.\nhttp:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/a6\/Laccolith_Montana.jpg\nA stock is just a small version of a batholith, with an\nexposed surface area of less than 40 square miles.\nDikes are sheet-like intrusions that cut across or are\ninjected into weakened cracks within previously-\nexisting beds of rock (as shown in photo). A Sill is an\nigneous intrusion that has been squeezed horizontally\nbetween pre-existing rock layers without lifting these\nlayers into a dome (in which case it would be a\nlaccolith).\nPhoto:\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Dike_diabase_AZ.jpg\nFOLDING FEATURES\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fold_(geology)\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 When tectonic forces act in such a manner that they force sections of the crust towards each\nother, the rocks that are squeezed together tend to either bend or break, sometimes both. If the\nrock layers are ductile (flexible), as they sometimes are deep inside the crust, they tend to bend\nbefore breaking. Other rocks are rigid (hard and inflexible) instead, and these tend not to bend at\nall. For ductile rock beds, the compressional forces bend them into unusual curves, which\ngeologists term folds, which can range in size from inches to several miles across. These folds\ncome in an entire array of shapes and forms but we can categorize them into four main\nrecognizable types; anticlines, synclines, monoclines, and overturned folds.\nImage from:\nhttp:\/\/www.google.com\/imgres?hl=en&sa=X&biw=1366&bih=667&tbm=isch&prmd=imvns&tbnid=mmHP1YRGj59fbM:&imgref\nurl=http:\/\/geology1a-\n1.wikispaces.com\/Folds%2Band%2BFaults%2Bwith%2Bcaptions&docid=iVXqMBCXgI7yfM&imgurl=http:\/\/geology1a-\n1.wikispaces.com\/file\/view\/folds.jpg\/92356584\/folds.jpg&w=600&h=433&ei=q_LbTq2fDcvZiAKJnNmqCg&zoom=1&iact=hc&vp\nx=1061&vpy=117&dur=3697&hovh=191&hovw=264&tx=171&ty=94&sig=114094837325809326006&page=1&tbnh=141&tbnw\n=195&start=0&ndsp=20&ved=1t:429,r:6,s:0\nAn anticline is an upward (convex)\nbend in bedrock, and is especially\ncommon in sedimentary rocks.

These breaks\nin brittle bedrock are referred to as faults. A fault is defined as a fracture or break between two\nblocks of bedrock resulting in measureable offset or displacement (movement) between the two\nblocks. The offset can be horizontal, vertical, or more often than not a combination of both. The\noffset along a fault can occur gradually in the form of creep, or rapidly during an earthquake.\nFaults vary in length from less than a mile to hundreds of miles in length, with repeated offset\nevery few years to thousands of years. Check out the following link to view animations of the\nmajor fault types. http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/faq\/?faqID=55\nFaults are usually divided into three main types known as normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip\nfaults.\nA normal fault is a break in the earth\u2019s crust due to the crust being pulled apart and thinned out\n(geologists refer to this as crustal extension). The thinning crust breaks into individual blocks\nbounded by steep fault lines, with some blocks being pulled down and adjacent blocks being\nforced upwards. The net result is a series of mountain ranges separated by deep valleys as in the\nBasin and Range Province extending from eastern California to Utah.\nA thrust fault or reverse\nfault is a break in bedrock\ndue to tectonic forced\ncompressing a portion of the\ncrust. The result is one block\nof bedrock moves higher than\nthe block on the opposing side\nof the fault. If the fault angle\nis high (steep) we often call\nthese reverse faults, and if the\nangle is low we refer to them\nas thrust faults, but in essence\nthey both operate in much the\nsame way. Our local\nmountains including the Santa\nSusana, Santa Monica and\nSan Gabriel Mountains as\nwell as the Verdugo Hills are\nbeing uplifted along reverse\nfaults running along their bases.\nA strike-slip fault is a localized break in bedrock where two blocks slide past one another along\nthe fault line. California\u2019s San Andreas Fault is not only a Transform Plate Boundary, it\u2019s also a\nfamous example of a strike-slip fault. Strike-slip faults come in two varieties; Left-lateral\nstrike-slip faults are those where the opposite side of the fault moves to the left during an\nearthquake, as with California\u2019s Garlock Fault. Right-lateral strike-slip faults are those where\nthe displacement on the opposite side of the fault is to the right. This is the case with the San\nAndreas Fault.\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 MEASURING EARTHQUAKES\nEarthquakes measurement has evolved steadily over time. We no longer use the Richter scale\nfor measuring earthquake strength, as this 1930s-era scale has been replaced with the more\nsuitable Moment magnitude and Modified Mercalli Intensity scales.\nMoment Magnitude (Mw) is the modern scale used by the United States Geological Survey\n(USGS) for measuring the energy released during an earthquake. The magnitude is based on\nthe seismic moment of the earthquake, which is calculated from strength of the ruptured rocks,\nthe length of the fault rupture, and the average displacement. These parameters are obtained\nfrom both seismographs, field observations, and geodetic measurements. The scale is\nlogarithmic, so an increase of one step corresponds to a 101.5 (approx. 32 times) increase in the\namount of energy released, and an increase of two steps corresponds to a 103 = 1000 times\nincrease in energy. Moment Magnitude is accurate for an entire range of earthquake magnitudes,\nwhich is not true of the old Richter scale. Lastly, there is only one Moment Magnitude for an\nearthquake, even though the shaking is generally stronger near the epicenter and in general gets\nless with distance from there. To explain and measure the shaking intensity, we have to look to a\ndifferent scale.\nThe Modified Mercalli Intensity scale (MM) is used to quantify the intensity of an earthquake\nby measuring the earthquake\u2019s effects on the landscape, people, and buildings. This scale ranges\nfrom I (not even felt) to XII (total destruction of buildings and bridges), and a single earthquake\nwill produce multiple values based in a general sense on the distance from the earthquake\u2019s\nepicenter.\nThere isn\u2019t a direct correlation between Moment Magnitude and Modified Mercalli Intensity, as\nmany factors such as bedrock topography, surface topography, earthquake depth, land use, and\npopulation influence the MM scale. A weak but shallow earthquake below a densely populated\ncity could yield a moderate intensity on the MM scale, whereas a strong but deep earthquake\nunder a sparsely populated area would produce a very low intensity on the MM scale. With that\nsaid, when averaging out the data from hundreds of earthquakes, a general correlation can be\nidentified between earthquake magnitude and earthquake intensity (see below).\nMagnitude (Mw) Typical Maximum Modified Mercalli Intensity\n1.0 - 3.0 I\n3.0 - 3.9 II \u2013 III\n4.0 - 4.9 IV \u2013 V\n5.0 - 5.9 VI \u2013 VII\n6.0 - 6.9 VII \u2013 IX\n7.0 + VIII +\n(http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/topics\/mag_vs_int.php)\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 The following is courtesy of the USGS (your tax dollars going to work for you).\n(http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/topics\/mag_vs_int.php)\nAbbreviated Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale\nI.

Thousands of seismographs are placed around the globe, giving\nus an ability to monitor ground motions in most every \u2018corner\u2019 of the world. When an earthquake\noccurs, the seismograph can record important data such as the duration of the quake and the\namplitude of the shaking. Comparing data from multiple seismographs allows scientists to\npinpoint the epicenter of the earthquake, the direction of rupture, and ultimately the fault\nresponsible for the quake. Earthquakes can be categorized into three main types; foreshocks,\nmainshocks and aftershocks.\nForeshocks are relatively smaller earthquakes that are followed shortly thereafter by a larger\nearthquake. Obviously, you cannot tell that an earthquake is only a foreshock until after the\nsubsequent larger earthquake (called a mainshock) occurs, and not all mainshocks are preceded\nby foreshocks. According to the USGS (http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/kids\/abc\/parents\/pf.html)\n\u201cAbout 6% of the time in California an aftershock will be larger than its mainshock. We then change\nour terminology and call the first earthquake a foreshock and the aftershock is called the mainshock.\nThe most notable difference between foreshock-mainshock pairs and mainshock-aftershock pairs is\nthat foreshocks always occur very close in space to their mainshock. Although aftershocks often\noccur over the full length of the fault and sometimes tens of kilometers away from the fault, we have\nnever seen a foreshock more than 10 km away from its mainshock. Because of the possibility that\nany earthquake could be a foreshock, the state of California has issued earthquake advisories when an\nearthquake has occurred within 10 km of a fault long enough to produce a major earthquake such as\nthe San Andreas fault. Just like most aftershocks occur right after their mainshock, most mainshocks\noccur very soon after their foreshock. The most likely time for a mainshock is within the first hour\n(one-quarter of all mainshocks happen within an hour of their foreshock) and after three days the risk\nof a larger event is almost gone. This is important to remember if you ever hear an earthquake\nadvisory. The most likely time for the potential mainshock is immediately and any action you take in\nresponse to the advisory should be something you are willing to be doing in a big earthquake.\u201d\nThe mainshock is the largest earthquake in a sequence, possibly but not necessarily preceded by\none or more foreshocks, and almost always followed by many aftershocks.\nAn aftershock (http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/glossary\/?term=aftershocks) is an earthquake that follows\nthe largest shock of an earthquake sequence. It is smaller than the mainshock and located no\nmore than two rupture lengths from the mainshock. Aftershocks can continue for weeks\nfollowing moderate earthquakes and up to several years following large-magnitude events.\nCheck out this animation showing foreshocks (blue), the mainshock (red) and aftershocks (yellow):\nhttp:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/animations\/animation.php?flash_title=Aftershock+Flash+Anima\ntion&flash_file=aftershock&flash_width=400&flash_height=275\nAs for earthquake timing, there is no special \u2018earthquake time\u2019. Earthquakes occur in geologic\ntime and although many Californians tend to believe that earthquakes occur more often in the\nearly morning hours, there is no supporting evidence for this. True, the two largest California\nearthquakes of the 20th century occurred between 4 and 5am, but the third largest occurred at 10\npm. and California has experienced large earthquakes at 1am, 8am, and 5pm. Earthquakes can\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 happen at any time and we should plan for them at home, work and school.\nhttp:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/kids\/abc\/parents\/pt.html\nEARTHQUAKE RECURRANCE INTERVAL\nThe recurrence interval, or return period, is the average time span between large\nearthquakes at a particular site. Recent scientific studies indicate that powerful\nearthquakes along the southern section of the San Andreas Fault, the portion running\nwithin 35 miles of Los Angeles, have occurred far more often than previously believed,\nabout every 88 years on average. The last big earthquake on this part of the San Andreas\nwas in 1857, so we appear to be WAY overdue. If this thought doesn\u2019t \u201cshake\u201d you up,\nconsider that the portion further south, near Palm Springs, hasn\u2019t shifted in more than 300\nyears, and there are numerous smaller faults located directly below LA\u2019s population\ncenters which are also capable of large quakes.\nA Map of Recent California Earthquakes (check it out)\nhttp:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/recenteqscanv\/\nMAJOR EARTHQUAKE HAZARD; TSUNAMI\nA tsunami or \"seismic sea wave\" is an oceanic wave that results from a large undersea\nearthquake, large enough to lift a portion of the ocean floor vertically. They can also be\ngenerated from large undersea landslides, or exploding volcanic islands.\nhttp:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/glossary\/?term=tsunami\nWhen the ocean has been faulted upwards water and energy are displaced in all directions across\nthe ocean surface. In the deep ocean tsunamis can travel at speeds of 500 mph or more, but as\nthey approach shallow coastlines they slow down and build into massive waves or a series of\nwaves-built-on-waves. As the waves crash on shore they are often traveling 30 to 40 mph and\ncan be over 50 or even 100 feet high. There is no outrunning a tsunami, so the best protection is\nan early warning and seeking the safety of high (very high) ground.\nhttp:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/kids\/abc\/parents\/pt.html\nLIQUEFACTION\nLiquefaction http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/glossary\/?term=liquefaction\nLiquefaction is the process where water-saturated sediment loses internal strength as a result of\nearthquake shaking. The process is most common in unconsolidated silt and fine sand deposits\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 where the water table is very close to the surface. Once the earthquake shaking stops the\nsediments harden back up, but by this time many buildings might have partially sunk into the\nliquefied sediment, with buried objects like septic tanks actually \u2018floated\u2019 to the surface.\nAnimation:\nhttp:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/animations\/animation.php?flash_title=Liquefaction+Flash+Ani\nmation&flash_file=liquefaction&flash_width=450&flash_height=200\nEARTHQUAKE PREPARATION\nPlease read so that you\u2019re prepared for the BIG ONE!! This was initially written for parents to inform and\nprepare their children but it is still valid for us.\nRecent images of earthquakes and tsunamis from around the world have captivated us all,\nreminding us of mother nature\u2019s immense power. No matter how terrifying the images, these\nevents have a tendency to fade from our minds over time, and are soon removed from our thoughts\ncompletely even though with live with the constant threat of a large earthquake in California.\nSo what can we do about this? The answer\u2026...nothing at all\u2026and everything we can.\nThe question is not IF we\u2019ll experience a large quake, the question is WHEN\u2026and there is\nabsolutely nothing we can do to stop these earthquakes from occurring.\nThen again, to protect ourselves and our children from the forces unleashed by a large earthquake,\nwe can do so very much if we plan in advance\nMost Southern Californians are aware of the risk of experiencing earthquakes, but our children\nmay not be so aware, and most of us are not prepared our homes or families for a large earthquake.\nTo prepare, every family (that\u2019s adults and children) needs to discuss what to expect during an\nearthquake, what to do during and after the event, and how to prepare now for an earthquake.\nThe first step is to discuss the following with the whole family that:\n1. We do indeed have earthquakes in Southern California (a favorite children\u2019s book on this is The\nMagic Tree House - Earthquake in the Early Morning, by Mary Pope Osborne)\n2. Though the shaking might be scary, it will only last between 30 seconds and 3 minutes\n3. During the shaking they should stay away from buildings if already outside, and if inside they\nshould drop to the floor or hide under the closest safe space, and cover their head with their\nhand\u2026hold on\u2026be quiet \u2026and try not to panic. The motto here is Drop-Cover-Hold.\n4. Once the shaking stops children should shout out so parents or teachers know where they are,\nand then quickly get to a safe place as aftershocks will likely occur within minutes. Normally,\naftershocks are not as strong and do not last nearly as long, but they can still add to the damage.\n5. Identify where to meet and where to call to \"check in\" if you become separated from your\nfamily during a disaster (older children with cell phones should have parents #s programmed and a\nphone# for a point of contact to check in with if local lines are down or overloaded). All family\nmembers can also contact RedCross.org to register on the Safe and Well Website or call 1-866\nGET-INFO and they will register for you.\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 6. Make sure to discuss with your children the emergency plan at their school (and any after-school\ncare programs) and who is listed on their emergency card. Assure them that someone will be there\nas soon as possible to get them but it may take time to get there. Remind them that others may be\nhurt and need care so they should stay calm and help comfort and calm those around them so the\nadults can care for others. Let your children know that the school has plans in place for providing\nfood and water and contacting you.\n7. The event can be particularly difficult for kids to make sense of, so talk to them and involve\nthem in cleanup tasks after the event. This will allow them to feel more connected to you, the\nparents, it will make them feel like they are part of the cleanup solution, and it will allow them to\nfeel a sense of personal control returning to their lives.\nMajor pre-earthquake planning includes:\n1. Safety-proofing your home\n2. Securing emergency supplies\n- Food, water, first-aid, clothing, camping gear, other essentials\n- Use what you already have before buying new stuff, and involve children in selecting the foods\nthat will be part of your emergency supply kit.\n3. Remembering to update your plan and supplies at least once a year.\n- Use a specific annual date to change out your supplies by using up the old supplies and\nreplacing them the same day with fresh ones (water, food, batteries, etc..). Kid\u2019s tastes change\nover time, so again, involve them in the new selections. I might suggest the Christmas Holiday\nseason as this is a time families get together, and December 26 is the anniversary of the 2004\nSumatra Earthquake and the resulting Indian Ocean Tsunami. Another option would be Martin\nLuther King holiday weekend, as this is the anniversary of the Northridge Earthquake, and the\nholiday\u2019s MLK moniker can have a secondary meaning of \u201cMy Lifesaving Kit\u201d. Or, better yet,\nchoose your child\u2019s birthdate so they will never let you forget this important annual event.\nSafety-Proofing Your Home\nMost houses in So Calif will stand up well to a large earthquake, and with some advance\nplanning they can be made even safer. Remember, what may seem safe to adults might be a\nheavy, dangerous object to children. Some ideas are:\n- Securing cupboards, bookcases and other heavy objects to the walls, with heavy objects kept on\nlower shelves.\n- Securing overhead fans to a support beam\n- Strapping your water heater to the wall and bolting your house to its foundation\n- Knowing the location of your utility shut-offs and any tool needed to switch them off.\n- Having a WORKING fire extinguisher in the house and knowing how to use it.\n- Keeping a flashlight and shoes next to your bed\n- Have a practice drill, so the whole family can identify safe zones within each room\nIT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO INVOLVE THE ENTIRE FAMILY(pets,too) IN THE\nPLANNING AND PRACTICING. The more you plan and practice the more empowered your\nchild will feel\nText \u00a9 Darren Leaver 2018 Secure Emergency Supplies\nFood\nRemember, your house might be damaged, but it is unlikely your house will collapse in an\nearthquake, even a large one. There will be no electricity for a while, so your fridge\/freezer will\nbe of little use after a day or more. Therefore, it is recommended that you obtain a large, good\nquality plastic cooler to store your non-perishable foods in, so that the food is edible when you\nneed it. You\u2019ll need a supply of food which will need to last several days.

We will now explore the key processes of weathering, transportation and\ndeposition along with some landforms that result in areas where ice, wind and water play the\ndominant role in sculpting the earth\u2019s surface.\nWeathering\nWeathering essentially refers to the breaking down or chemical alteration of rock material at or\njust below the earth\u2019s surface. Weathering usually results in smaller, weaker rock fragments and\nmolecules which can then be more easily removed and transported (eroded) by wind, water, ice\nand gravity. There are two main forms of weathering known as Physical Weathering (sometimes\nreferred to as Mechanical Weathering) and Chemical Weathering.\nPhysical weathering involves physically breaking rocks into fragments without changing the\nchemical make-up of the rock material. This can be achieved in numerous ways, including:\n\u2022 Freeze-Thaw: This process occurs when ice forms inside existing cracks or pores\nwithin rocks. As the ice forms it exerts enough pressure to extend the cracks deeper\ninto the rock. If this ice subsequently melts, the water can make its way deeper into the\ncracks of the rock. If\nthis water was to freeze\nonce more (and\nexpand), the cracks\nwould extend further\ninto the rock material.\nThis process can be\nespecially effective in\nmountainous\nenvironments where\nmild temperatures can\nbe experienced during\nthe day followed by\nfreezing temperatures\nat night. This\nrepetitious freeze-thaw\naction is responsible\nfor the ice wedging in\nthe high altitude rock outcrops of California\u2019s mountains including the Sierra Nevada\nwhere rocks, large and small, have been wedged from their source before falling to form\na talus cone at the base of cliffs.\nRock fractured by freeze-thaw. Photo by Kathy Duret. \u2022 Root Wedging: This process is similar to Ice wedging,\nbut instead of ice it\u2019s the roots of trees and other plants\nthat break open the rock material. As a young tree\nbegins to take root, it will expand its roots downward\nand outward as it tries to secure itself, obtain moisture,\nand grab nutrients. As these roots grow they can exert\nenormous pressure, and if the roots find themselves in an\nenclosed space (like a crack in a rock, or under a\nsidewalk) the force is more than enough to crack the rock\nfurther or lift up a sidewalk. This process can occur in\nany environment with significant biological activity.\nEven small plants and lichen can extend tiny roots into\nthe microscopic cracks of rocks in the arctic tundra,\nthereby loosening the surface of these rocks. Conversely,\nareas where large trees and associated roots are\nabundant, such a tropical and mid-latitude forests, might\nexperience extensive root wedging many feet below the\nland surface.

Crystal growth\noccurs when salty water finds its way into the pores\nor spaces of rocks. As this salty water dries out,\npure water evaporates into the atmosphere while\nthe salt crystalizes and grows in the cracks of the\nrocks. The growth of the salt crystals puts pressure\non the rock, causing the cracks and pores to extend\nfurther into rocks, ultimately breaking them into\never-smaller pieces.\nRock broken up by salt crystal growth. Photo by Kathy Duret.\n\u2022 Erosional Unloading (exfoliation): Some types of rocks (e.g. igneous intrusive and\nsome metamorphic rocks) are formed at great depth in the earth\u2019s crust, under\ntremendous pressure. The high pressure, a result of the weight of all those layers of\noverlying rock material, tends to create very dense, uniform rocks without cracks or\npores. When these rocks are uplifted towards the earth\u2019s surface and the overlying\nrocks are weathered and eroded away, they become subjected to progressively less\nexternal pressure. Think of a page of notebook paper that you crumple up as tight as\nyou can to form a paper ball. Once you let go of the\npaper and are no longer applying pressure, the paper\nball you just created will grow larger. Rocks created\nunder pressure act the same way as they are uplifted\ntowards the earth\u2019s surface. The lower pressure\ncreates tension within the rock materials which\nexpand as a result, and a pattern of cracks (called\njoints) forms within the rocks. The joints typically\nform a pattern of 90-degree angles relative to the overlying surface.\nPhoto of exfoliated granitic rocks by Kathy Duret. These joints are then exposed to other types of weathering, which further enhances the\nextent of the cracks. This can result in blocky, cube-like outcrops in some locations or\nan onion-layer appearance on the surface of large rock domes.\nChemical weathering involves a chemical change in the rock material by removing (or at\ntimes, adding to) elements from the chemical structure of the rock material. Chemical\nweathering occurs in-place, and there is no significant movement of the rock material. The\nmajor types of chemical weathering include the following:\n\u2022 Carbonation: Rock materials that are\nsubjected to acidic water can be significantly\nweakened as their chemical composition is\ndisrupted by chemical reaction with carbonic\nacid. This form of chemical weathering is\nreferred to as carbonation. Rainfall is naturally\nacidic due in part to the mixing of carbon\ndioxide and water in the atmosphere. The\ncarbon dioxide and water combine to form a\nweak acid known as carbonic acid. This acidity\ncan be accentuated through the presence of atmospheric pollutants (recall our\ndiscussion of Acid Rain). When precipitation occurs, the acidic rain drops interact with\nrock materials at the earth\u2019s surface. All\nrock materials that interact with rainfall or\ninfiltrated soil water\/groundwater have to\ncontend with acidic water, but rocks\ncomposed of calcite minerals, such as\nlimestone, are the most susceptible to\ncarbonation. For limestone and similar\nrock types, carbonic acid can dissolve the\nrock material and carry the soluble\ncompounds away, leaving behind a void.\nThe voids can range in size from miniscule\nto giant cave systems.\nTropical karst landscape, Ha Long Bay, Vietnam - created largely by the process of carbonation. Photos by author.\nAdd solution, stalagmites, etc.??\n\u2022 Hydration\/Hydrolysis: These are forms of chemical weathering where water\nmolecules are incorporated into the structure of minerals within rock material.\nHydration is where the entire water molecule is incorporated into the structure of the\nmineral, making it larger and weaker than the original material. A key example is the\nhydration of anhydrite minerals to form larger and weaker gypsum minerals. The\nweaker gypsum minerals can then be physically weathered more easily. A similar\nchemical weathering process involving water is Hydrolysis, but in this case the water\nmolecule (H O) is broken up into its constituent ions (H+ and OH-), which are then\n2\nincorporated into the structure of the affected minerals. Hydrolysis makes the rock\nmaterial weaker and more susceptible to weathering. A key example is the very slow\nhydrolysis of alkali feldspar minerals within granitic rocks, which yields soluble alkali\nelements (potassium, sodium, calcium), clay minerals and quartz granules.\n\u2022 Oxidation: Rock material that is exposed to oxygen (in the atmosphere or in water)\nresults in the mineral composition of the rock material being altered. This process,\ncalled oxidation, occurs as oxygen atoms are incorporated into the structure of the\nmineral, making the mineral less resistant to weathering. As an example, rocks and minerals containing the element Iron\n(Fe) change to a red color when oxidized. This color, and the\nprocess that created it, are commonly called \u201crust\u201d.\nPhoto of broken boulder showing evidence of oxidation weathering.\nhttps:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/04\/Weathering_9039.jpg\/1280px-Weathering_9039.jpg\nMASS WASTING & EROSION\nThe products of physical weathering are pieces of rock material that are typically smaller and\nlooser than the original rock material, whereas the products of chemical weathering are pieces of\nrock material that are typically larger and looser than the original rock material. These looser\npieces of rock material can now be removed, transported and broken into smaller pieces as they\nmove further away from the original rock material through the processes of erosion and mass\nwasting. Erosion refers to the removal and transportation of rock fragments primarily by the\nforce of water, ice or wind. Globally, water is the main agent of erosion but we\u2019ll soon see that ice\nis the dominant agent in glacial environments while wind can play a significant role in very dry\nregions. Mass wasting is the downhill movement of rock material due primarily to gravity. Rock\nfalls, rock slides and debris flows are examples. To summarize, when a rock fragment is\nchemically or physically loosened but does not move, we call this weathering. Once the rock\nfragment is detached and begins to move, we call this erosion.\nMASS WASTING:\nWeathered rock materials at elevated positions such as hills or mountains, along with the rocks\nthey sit atop, are susceptible to being dislodged and moved downhill under the forces of gravity,\nwater, ice and wind. Mass wasting is the process whereby soil, sediment, regolith and rocks move\ndownslope due mostly to the force of gravity, aided by the presence of water. The presence of\nwater in the pores and cracks adds weight to the weathered rock material while also lubricating\nthe slippage surfaces. The mass wasting process can proceed quickly, as in a large boulder falling\nfrom a cliff, or very slowly, as in the decades-long downhill \u2018creep\u2019 of soil on a hill.\nFactors that influence mass wasting include the following:\n\u2022 Slope angle: In general, the steeper the slope angle the more it is susceptible to mass\nwasting. For example, steep cliffs are typically more susceptible to mass wasting compared\nto mild slopes. Slopes can be made steeper when rock material is added to the top of the\nslope (as can happen with a growing volcano) or by removing rock material from the lower\nportion of the slope. This undercutting of the \u2018toe\u2019 of the slope can occur through erosion\nand construction projects. In addition, water flows faster on a steep slope compared to a\nmild slope, and faster-flowing water has a great ability to pick up and entrain rock material,\nvegetation and other material, creating a type of mass wasting called a \u2018debris flow\u2019. Debris\nflows are mobilized much more frequently on steep slopes compared to mild slopes.\n\u2022 Type of rock material: Some rock types are more susceptible to mass wasting than\nothers. Crystalline rocks such as granite have incredibly strong bonds between the\nminerals within the rock, allowing them to stand firm, even while forming massive cliffs.\nOn the other hand, rock materials that are not tightly consolidated such as loose, sandy\nsediment cannot form such steep cliffs, especially if this sediment is very dry or excessively\nwet. \u2022 Geologic bed angle and orientation. Sedimentary rocks are typically formed in\nhorizontal layers deep below the surface. Once uplifted, these geologic strata can be\ndeformed, bent and tilted to form mountains and hills. The uplifted strata can be tilted and\noriented at various angles and directions, so that some strata dip downward but into the\nhillside, while other strata can dip downward and out of the hillside. Though there are\nmany factors to consider, rock beds that dip outward from a mountain or hillside are\ngenerally more susceptible to mass wasting compared to rock beds that dip inward\ntowards a hillside or mountain. This is because rock layers that dip into a mountain can\u2019t\neasily slip into the mountain.\n\u2022 Water content: Water located in voids, cracks and pore spaces adds weight to the rock\nmaterial and lubricates the geologic strata. If some of these rock layers are rich in clay, the\npresence of water can reduce the cohesion (stickiness) between rock layers, allowing\nslippage and flow to occur more readily. Think of your experience walking on dry clay\nversus wet clay \u2013 I\u2019m sure you found it easier to slip on the wet clay. These rock materials\non a slope can experience the same response. For this reason, mass wasting events such as\nlandslides, debris flows and slumps can occur more frequently in California\u2019s winter and\nspring, during and immediately after our winter storms have moistened our hillsides.\n\u2022 Vegetative cover: The presence of vegetation is critical to the stability of rock materials\non hillsides and steep slopes. The root systems of plants help hold the soil, sediment and\nregolith in place, thereby stabilizing hillsides. Even with torrential rainfall, the leaves of\nplants can slow down the velocity of rain drops, lessening their impact on the soil surface.\nPlants can also slow down the velocity of water flowing along the surface of a hillside,\nthereby reducing the water\u2019s potential to erode the hillside. Conversely, slopes that have\nbeen denuded of vegetation following a wildfire, construction, or other land use change are\nmore susceptible to both mass wasting and erosion. Keep an eye on the news in the winter\nfollowing a major brush fire. You are certain to see coverage as neighborhoods prepare for\ndebris flows (which many in the news press incorrectly refer to as mudslides).\nSome Specific Types of Mass Wasting\nThere are numerous types of mass wasting, differentiated by the speed (from instantaneous to\ndecades or more) and the method (flow, fall, slide) of downhill movement. Here are just a few\ntypes of mass wasting:\n\u2022 Soil Creep (very slow downhill movement). Soil creep is\nthe very slow downhill movement of the upper few feet of\nsoil, regolith and\/or rock due to the pull of gravity. The\nprocess affects steeper slopes more than mild slopes, but\nthe process can occur on both. The downslope movement\nof soil occurs with the daily and seasonal expansion of the\nsoil as it heats and expands, cools and contracts, absorbs\nwater and expands, then dries out and shrinks.\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Category:Soil_creep#\/media\/File:Soil_Creep.tif\nIndividual grains of soil tend to move outward, parallel to the slope surface as the soil\nexpands, but then move vertically downward as the soil contracts. (diagram) \u2192 \u2193 Repeated\naction over months, years and decades leads to the slow downhill movement of the soil grains. Deep tree roots can help protect slopes from soil creep, but shallow roots, poles,\nfences and foundations are slowly carried rotated and carried downslope. The process\ntakes too long to be noticed by the naked eye but becomes very apparent after comparing\nphotographs taken years apart.\n\u2022 Landslide (slow to fast downhill movement). A landslide is a rapid downslope movement\nof a large mass of rock material along a weak, linear layer of strata. As the name implies,\nlandslides \u2018slide\u2019 rather than flow. Landslides are accentuated by rainfall as the infiltrating\nwater reaches the clay-rich strata, thereby\nlubricating the slippage plane. This can also occur\nthrough human activity such as over-watering of\nlawns, breaking utility lines, or installing septic\nsystems on a vulnerable hillside. Landslides can\nalso be initiated through seismic activity as the\nground shaking can put an unstable slope into\nmotion. The common forms of landslides are\nslump, debris slide, rock slide, rock fall, debris fall\nand avalanche.\nLa Conchita Landslide, CA. https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:La_Conchita_landslide,_2005.jpg\n\u2022 Slump (slow to fast downhill movement). A slump\nis similar to a landslide, but the slippage occurs\nalong a curved, spoon-shaped surface within the\nrock material rather than along a linear layer of\nstrata. of a decline. Slumps involve a mass of soil\nor other material sliding along a curved surface\n(shaped like a spoon). Crescent-shaped scarps\noften form at the top (head) of a slump, while a\nbulbous mound of rock debris forms at the bottom\n(toe) of the slump.\nSlump on Highway 35. https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Slump_block_on_Interstate_Highway-35_-\n_panoramio.jpg\n\u2022 Debris Flow (moderate to fast downhill movement). As the name implies, a debris flow is\nthe fluid downhill movement of soil, regolith, and unearthed vegetation flowing downhill\nafter a major rainfall event. The storm run-off\ntends to get channeled into hillside canyons, where\nthe fast-moving floodwaters pick up soil, rock\nfragments and even trees to form a thick concrete-\nlike slurry that moves downhill at speeds of 40mph\nor more. This dense, fast-moving slurry smashes\nanything in its path, then takes the new debris\nalong for the ride. The energy of the debris flow\ndissipates once the canyon opens out into a valley\nor alluvial plain, where the debris flow deposits a\nfresh, wet layer of mud, sand, gravel, boulders and\nplant debris.\nPhoto: Aftermath of a debris flow in California, 1998.\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:FEMA_-_1337_-_Photograph_by_Dave_Gatley_taken_on_03-01-\n1998_in_California.jpg \u2022 Rock Fall (very fast downslope movement). A rock fall\noccurs where rock fragments detach and freely fall down\na slope, such as a cliff face. Rock fall can occur as the\nresult of an earthquake, frost- or root-wedging of the\nrock fragment, or even from disturbance of the rock\nfragment by animals such as mountain goats. The fallen\nrock material tends to accumulate at the base of the\nslope. This fallen rock material is referred to as talus,\nand the cone-shaped accumulation of rock material is\nreferred to as a talus cone.\nPhoto of talus cone. https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/gerrythomasen\/9188093051\nEROSION\nAs a reminder, erosion refers to the removal and transportation of rock fragments primarily by\nthe force of water, ice or wind. We will now explore the erosional processes associated with\nflowing water, ice and wind, along with both the erosional and depositional landforms created by\nthese forces.\nGlacial Processes & Landforms\nGlacial landforms are created by a process where glaciers carve their way downslope from\nmountains to valleys, or from continental interiors towards the coast. The two major types of\nglaciers are known as alpine glaciers and continental glaciers based on whether they form\nmainly due to their mountainous location or their continental location. (need map of modern\nglaciers)\nMost of today's glacial landforms were created\nduring a series of glacial advances and retreats\nover the past 2 million years. Every part of the\nplanet has been influenced by these periods of\nglaciation, but today the glaciers have retreated\nfar from their previous extents, so to experience\nglaciers today you need to travel to high\nmountainous areas (e.g. Rocky Mountains, Alps,\nAndes, Himalayas, Southern Alps) or at high\nlatitude (e.g. Greenland, Antarctica).\nFurthermore, as a result of climate change the\nextent of glaciers is being reduced faster than ever\nbefore. Even so, areas no longer glaciated can still\nshow evidence of prior glaciation through the\npresence of landforms that only glacial activity\ncould have produced. These include both\nerosional landforms, created when a glacier\nremoves rock material and transports it\ndownslope, and depositional landforms, when\nthe glacier releases the rock material.\nUSGS (1919) & NPS (2004) photos of Teklanika Glacier,\nAlaska: https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/articles\/aps-v6-i1-c2.htm NASA images of Muir Glacier, Alaska. https:\/\/climate.nasa.gov\/climate_resources\/4\/graphic-dramatic-glacier-melt\/\nGlacial Processes.\nGlacial landforms are created as thick accumulations of ice begin to move downhill under\nthe pull of gravity. The source of the glacial ice is snowfall, but the snow needs many\ndecades to gradually change from loose\nsnow into firn (unpacked ice) and\nfinally into dense glacial ice. Not all ice\nat high elevation or high latitude will\nmove. It requires the weight of\nhundreds of feet of glacial ice to push\ndownward with enough force to\npartially melt the bottom layer, making\nit fluid enough to commence movement.\nIt takes centuries or millennia to\naccumulate sufficient weight to set the\nglacial ice in motion. Once in motion,\nthe mass of ice flows as a \u2018river of ice\u2019\nknown as a glacier.\nNASA photo of Sondrestrom Glacier, Greenland\nhttps:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/thumbnails\/image\/sondrestrom.jpg At the highest point of an alpine glacier, where the glacier first develops, we find a unique\nlandform known as a cirque, a lens-shaped excavation with the concave side of the lens\noriented downslope. Cirques have steep cliffs (called Ar\u00eates) on the uphill sides, a\ndepression in the middle, and a slight ridge on the downhill side. If several cirques form on\nthe same mountain ridge, the intersecting lens shapes tend to form steep mountain spires\nknown as horns.\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:YOSE_29_Glacial-features_WEB.jpg\nThe world\u2019s most famous of horn is Switzerland\u2019s Matterhorn.\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Matterhorn#\/media\/File:Matterhorn_from_the_north-east.jpg\nCirques form when ice wedges rock material from the steep cliff faces, which then fall and\naccumulate along with snow and ice below the cliffs. When enough snow, rock and ice have\naccumulated they begin to flow downslope as an alpine glacier. As the glacier commences\nits downslope flow it scours the floor of the cirque. Since so much ice and rock material has accumulated at the base of the cliffs, the glacier scours a\ndeep depression on the floor of the cirque before riding\nover the small ridge on the downhill edge of the\ndepression. The glacier then exits the cirque and\ncontinues downslope, carving and scouring a u-shaped\nvalley as it grinds downhill. In warmer times and when\nglaciers have retreated, water trapped in the depression\nof the cirque will often form a small glacial lake known as a tarn.\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Cirque_glaciers#\/media\/File:Glacial_Cirque_Formation_EN.svg\nFresh snowfall, ice from avalanches, and ice from tributary glaciers adds to the ice content\nof the upper portion of the glacier. This upper portion of the glacier, where new\naccumulations snow and ice are greater than the amount lost to melting and sublimation is\nreferred to as the accumulation zone. As the glacier moves further downslope, it\nencounters warmer and warmer temperatures, which tend to melt the ice and shrink the\nglacier.\nAlpine Glacier Diagram: https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Glacier_diagram.svg\nThe lower portion of the glacier, where ice loss is greater than the amount being\nreplenished is referred to the ablation zone. The melted ice turns into glacial meltwater,\nwhich tends to flow under the glacier before exiting at the glacier\u2019s terminus in for form of\na river. Over decades, glaciers can grow in size and volume if there is more accumulation\nthan ablation, a situation that leads to glacial advance where the glacier\u2019s location extends\nfurther downslope. Alternatively, when glaciers experience more melting\/ablation than\naccumulation of new snowfall, the glacier loses volume and mass, and the glacier tends to\nretreat upslope. This is not to say that the ice moves uphill, because all glacial ice moves\nin a downslope direction. Instead, it means that for a glacier in retreat, the amount of ice\nmelting in the ablation zone is greater than the amount of ice moving in from the\naccumulation zone. Erosional Glacial Landforms\nBesides cirques and aretes, there are other unique landforms associated with glaciers\nmoving down a mountain valley or from a continental interior towards the coast. Contrary\nto popular belief, glacial ice does not cut out or carve the erosional landforms associated\nwith glacial landscapes. Instead, it is the rock\nmaterial incorporated into and carried along\nwith the glacial ice that does the erosional work.\nThese trapped rock fragments are responsible\nfor grinding, abrading and \u2018scouring\u2019 away the\nrocks encountered on the sides and bottom of\nthe glacier, acting much like sandpaper. This\nerosional process is referred to as glacial \u2018scour\u2019\nand results in smoothly polished surfaces on the\nsides and bottoms of glaciers.\nImage: Souring of rock by a glacier\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Arranque_glaciar-en.svg\nIt should be noted that the main by-product of glacial scour is a finely-ground rock powder\nknown as glacial flour. This glacial flour is then carried downslope by the glacier and by\nthe meltwater running along the ice-rock interface. The presence of the glacial flour gives\nfast-moving meltwater a powdery white appearance. Once the glacial meltwater slows\ndown, as when it reaches a lake, the glacial flour gives the water a wonderful aqua-blue\nappearance like with New Zealand\u2019s Lake Tekapo in the following photo.\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Lake_Tekapo#\/media\/File:Lake_Tekapo.JPG For alpine glaciation, the degree of scouring increases with the thickness of the ice, so\nscouring is more effective in the center of an alpine glacier (where there is thicker ice)\ncompared to the sides of the glacier. Therefore, U-shaped valleys are a common erosional\nlandform associated with alpine glaciers.\nClassic U-shaped glacial valley in Ladakh.\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:U-shaped_valley_at_the_head_of_Leh_valley,_Ladakh.JPG\nJust as with rivers, glaciers have tributaries where large glaciers are fed by networks of\nsmaller glaciers. Since larger glaciers with thicker ice can scour the bottom rock layers\nmore efficiently, the tributary glaciers enter the main glacier high up in the ice mass. In\ntimes of glacial retreat, evidence of these tributary glaciers can be seen high up on the cliff\nface of the (now retreated) main glacier. These smaller u-shaped tributary valleys located\nhigh up on cliff faces are referred to as hanging valleys and are clear evidence of previous\nglaciation.\nHanging Valley in Milford Sound, New Zealand. https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/joceykinghorn\/11184137705 To see hanging valleys in California, make sure to visit Yosemite National Park to encounter\nthese wonderful landforms like at Bridalveil Fall.\nHanging Valley in Yosemite N.P. https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/articles\/ushapedvalleysfjordshangingvalleys.htm\nU-shaped valleys extending all the way to the ocean, creating long, narrow inlets with steep\ncliff sides are referred to as fjords.\nThere are many such inlets in places like Norway, Alaska and New Zealand.\nPhoto of John Hopkins Inlet in Glacier Bay N.P. Alaska.\nhttps:\/\/www.nps.gov\/articles\/ushapedvalleysfjordshangingvalleys.htm\nIn addition to souring, the second major erosional\nprocess that glaciers undertake is that of plucking.

These piles of rock fragments are referred to as moraines. Those that form\nto the sides of (and parallel to) the glacier are\nreferred to as lateral moraines, while the\nthose that form at the very end (terminus) of\nthe glacier are referred to as terminal\nmoraines. Moraines are a little shorter in\nheight than the glacier that formed them, but if\nthe glacier is hundreds of feet high, so too can\nbe the moraines. Once a glacier is in retreat,\nthe meltwater can be trapped behind the loose\nmaterial of the terminal moraine, creating a\ntemporary lake, at least until the water\nbreaches the moraine.\nPhoto of lateral moraine on the Athabasca Glacier, Alberta, Canada.\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Athabasca_Glacier-Moraine.jpg Terminal moraine (red arrow) in Cordillera Huyhuash, Peru.

However, the west coast of the USA was spared\nfrom these ice sheets with the exception of our high elevation mountains.\nImage Source: http:\/\/www.dandebat.dk\/eng-klima5.htm\nThis is not to say California didn\u2019t feel the impact of these great ice sheets, as our climate,\nweather, natural vegetation distribution, animal distribution, etc. were heavily impacted by\nthe presence of glacial ice and the factors that allowed them to exist at the time. There are\nmany landforms we can see in the Sierra Nevada today that were most definitely formed by\nglacial activity thousands of\nyears ago. These include the U-\nshaped glacial valley of Yosemite\nalong with its many waterfalls\nemanating from hanging valleys.\nOn the Eastern side of the Sierra\nNevada there is further evidence\nof glacial activity in the form of\nnumerous tarn lakes and lateral\nmoraines such as those shown in\nthis photo of McGee Creek near\nMammoth Lakes.\nMoraines at McGee Creek, CA.\nPhoto by Kathy Duret. Since the last glacial period California has warmed, the glaciers of the Sierra Nevada have\nretreated and our climate has generally became more mild and moist. This created an\ninterconnected system of lakes and rivers being fed, in part, by the glacial meltwaters. We\ncan trace the eastward flow of meltwater from the Sierra Nevada. The meltwater formed a\nseries of rivers that would fill up valleys, which would themselves overflow into a\ndownstream river, fill up another valley, and so forth for hundreds of miles.\nCalifornia\u2019s pluvial lake system.\nhttps:\/\/serc.carleton.edu\/integrate\/teaching_materials\/earth_modeling\/student_materials\/unit6_article1.html\nThese glacially-fed lakes, called pluvial lakes, included Owens Lake, Searles Lake,\nPanamint Lake, and Lake Manly, which at times had a depth of several hundred feet. Lake\nManly dried up once the flow of glacial meltwater ceased (in conjunction with a warmer,\ndryer climate) and today the lake-less, dry location is better known as Death Valley.\nEvidence of these pluvial lakes can be seen in the form of ancient shorelines which mark\nthe former size and extent of these lakes at various times.\nThe horizontal lines on Shoreline Butte, Death Valley, CA mark ancient shorelines of Pleistocene Lake Manly\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:ShorelineButte030710.JPG AEOLIAN PROCESSES and LANDFORMS:\nIn dry regions such as deserts, where there is a ready supply of loose clay, silt or sand but very\nlittle vegetation, wind can play a large role in the erosion, transportation and deposition of rock\nmaterials. The key wind-driven processes (known as aeolian processes) in these arid areas\ninclude deflation (the removal of loose rock particles by the wind) and abrasion (the\nsandblasting of rocks and other materials by windborne particles). A landform shaped by the\nwind is referred to as an aeolian landform which includes the iconic desert sand dune. (images)\nDeserts that experience sustained aeolian erosion often form desert pavement, a near-\ncontinuous surface layer of rock fragments that protects fine-grained sediments below from wind\nerosion. This stony desert pavement is what remains after strong winds have removed the finer\nparticles from the desert surface. Desert pavement surfaces can exist for extensive time periods,\nand the relative age of the pavement can be determined by analyzing the thickness of desert\nvarnish, a dark mineral stain that sometimes forms on desert pavement when exposed for a long\nperiod of time.\nFine-grained sediments that have been deflated from the desert surface are carried down-wind in\nthree main ways; suspension, saltation and creep (see diagram).\nImage: Suspension, saltation and creep. https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Transportation_by_wind.jpg\n\u2022 Suspension: Suspension refers to fine-grained particles like clay, silt and sand being\ncaught in and carried by wind above the ground surface. In general, sand-size particles can\nonly be suspended or a very short duration, and cannot rise more than a few inches or feet\nabove the surface. Silt particles can be suspended for a longer duration and travel higher\nabove the land surface. Clay and fine silt particles, due to their tiny size, can travel high\ninto the atmosphere and be suspended for a very long duration as atmospheric dust, and\nunder specific circumstances in deserts can develop into to dust storms.\n\u2022 Saltation: Saltation is the downwind movement of silt and sand particles bouncing along in\na series of jumps and skips. Saltation in typical desert wind speeds would occur just a few\ninches to feet above the ground surface, depending largely on the particle sizes and the\nwind speed. As the particles skip and bounce along the surface, they tend to hit and\ndislodge other downwind particles which then continue the saltation process.\n\u2022 Creep: Saltating particles that bounce along the desert floor and hit larger particles that\nare too heavy to be lifted above the ground (such as medium or course-grained sand) will\nslowly push the larger particles further downwind in a process known as creep.\nAbrasive rock particles that are transported downwind by saltation or suspension can impact\nobstacles including large boulders and rock outcrops. Over time, these abrasive particles can\nscratch and polish ventifacts including grooves and flutes into the boulders and outcrops. Ventifacts on a boulder in the Mojave Desert, CA.\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Category:Ventifacts_in_the_United_States#\/media\/File:Ventifact_MojaveDesert_2000.jpg\nWith extended exposure to abrasive winds, rock outcrops can be sculpted into linear, streamlined\nfeatures called yardangs.\nYardang, China. https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f2\/Yandang_Shan_Geopark_12.JPG Deflated and eroded rock particles with continue their downwind movement until the wind\nvelocity slows to the point that the particles can no longer be subjected to suspension, saltation or\ncreep and the rock particles are then deposited on the desert surface. Larger particles are the first\nto be deposited, with fine clay particles traveling furthest and deposited last. The deposited\nsediment is laid down in extensive, sheet-like accumulations or in large ripple-like features such\nas sand dunes. When the sediments are deposited as an extensive sheet of loose silt (with minor\namounts of clay and fine sand) covering the desert landscape for many miles and many feet deep,\nthis is referred to as desert loess: Extensive areas of desert loess can be found in the deserts of\ncentral Asia.\nLoess landscape near Hunyuan, Shanxi Province, China.\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Category:Loess#\/media\/File:Loess_landscape_china.jpg\nThe most iconic aeolian depositional landforms found in the desert are sand dunes, hills of loose\nsand deposited by the wind. Sand dunes come in numerous shapes and sizes,\nThree common types of desert sand dunes include the following:\n(https:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/deserts\/dunes\/)\n\u2022 Crescent Dunes (aka barchan). These crescent-\nshaped mounds are wider than they are long with the\nsteep slip faces on the concave sides of the dunes.\nThese dunes form from winds that blow consistently\nfrom one direction, with the entire dune slowly\nmoving in that same direction. As with most dunes,\ncrescent dunes are formed and maintained when\nturbulent winds slow down and drop their load of\nsuspended sand.\nImage of Crescent Dune: https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Barchan_dune.jpg As the sand is deposited, the grains saltate along the gently rising slope on the windward\nside of existing dune sand, then shoot over or falls down the steep leeward \u201cslip face\u201d of the\ndune. As this process continues, crescent dunes tend to move in the general direction of\nthe prevailing wind. Crescent dunes are the most common type of dune on earth, and are\ncommon in the deserts of California and Nevada.\nCrescent dune near Tonopah, NV.\nhttps:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/02\/An_evening_at_Crescent_Dunes_near_Tonopah%2C_Nevada_-\n_%2827034284365%29.jpg\n\u2022 Longitudinal Dunes. Longitudinal dunes (aka Linear or Seif Dunes) are long, straight sand\nridges that form parallel to one another and to the predominant wind direction. The linear\nnature of these dunes channels the prevailing winds into\nthe troughs between the dunes. As the name suggests,\nlinear dunes are much longer than they are wide, in some\ncases over 100 miles in length. Linear dunes can be\nobserved on the western edge of the Algodones Dunes in\nsoutheastern California\u2019s Coachella Valley.\nhttps:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/12\/The_Algodones_Dunes.jpg Linear dunes in the Great Sand Sea, Egypt.\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/w\/index.php?search=linear+dune&title=Special:Search&profile=default&fulltext=1&searchToken=drh\ntrory1is8ugs65yrm2ppc1#\/media\/File:Linear_Dunes,_Great_Sand_Sea,_Egypt_-_NASA_Earth_Observatory.jpg\n\u2022 Star Dunes. Star\ndunes form in areas\nwith multi-directional\nwinds, creating a sand\nmound with three or\nmore arms radiating\nfrom a central point.\nThese dunes grow\nvertically rather than\nlaterally.\nStar Dune. https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/w\/index.php?curid=1524633 WATER in DESERT ENVIRONMENTS\nThough wind is a major force of erosion in desert environments, it is water that is the most\nforceful agent in sculpting the desert landscape. Desert winds act on a daily basis, and although\nprecipitation is infrequent, when it does rain in the desert the precipitation tends to be intense.\nViolent desert rainstorms can produce flash floods that quickly and efficiently transport loose rock\nmaterial downslope from higher elevations to the desert floor in fast-moving debris flows. Thus,\nthe desert landscape contains many more key features than the aeolian landforms discussed\npreviously, including the following:\nAlluvial Fans: Alluvial fans are accumulations of clay, silt, sand, gravel and boulders (collectively\ncalled alluvium) that have been deposited where a mountain canyon opens out onto the desert\nfloor. Physical and chemical weathering process in the mountains produce a continuous supply of\nrock fragments, and during heavy rainfall events these fragments are \u2018flushed\u2019 out of the canyon\nand are deposited as a fan-shaped slope reaching out towards the desert floor.\nAlluvial fans coalescing to form a bajada in Death Valley, CA. Photo by Kathy Duret\nAlong mountain fronts where multiple nearby canyons deposit alluvial sediments onto the desert\nfloor, the alluvial fans tend to join together and coalesce into continuous apron of alluvium known\nas a bajada.\nArroyos: Arroyos are deep gullies or channels cut into unconsolidated (soft) desert sediment of\nby fast-moving flood waters. Arroyos typically have flat floors and steep banks and although they\nare dry for much of the year, they can become a raging torrent under flash flood conditions.

Playas form in\ndesert basins that lack a large enough river to drain them\neffectively, including many areas of eastern California\u2019s\nMojave Desert and Basin & Range Province.\nRacetrack Playa, CA\nhttps:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/gsfc\/4882084749\nFor more details on desert processes and landforms on the Mojave Desert make sure to check out\nhttps:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/2004\/1007\/intro.html Coastlines are dynamic zones where the\nhydrosphere meets the various earth\nmaterials of the lithosphere. It is the\nIntertidal Zone, located between the\nhighest high tide and the lowest low-tide,\nwhere wave energy, tides and currents erode\nrock materials and deposit sediments to\ncreate distinct coastal landscapes including\nwave-cut cliffs, beaches and sand spits.\nIntertidal Zone Cabrillo National Monument, CA\nhttps:\/\/www.nps.gov\/cabr\/learn\/nature\/tidepools.htm\nWaves are the most powerful force acting on the coastal zones. They get their energy from winds\nblowing over ocean surfaces. The friction between the wind and the water surface generates\nwave energy which then propagates outwards in all directions in the form of an ocean swell. For\nexample, when strong winter winds blow for several days or weeks in the Gulf of Alaska, the\nswell can cross thousands of miles of the Pacific ocean before reaching the California coastline.\nThe distance between the area where a swell is generated and the coastline the swell reaches is\nknown as the fetch). In the deep ocean, the wave energy continues to travel in the form of the\nocean swell, with parallel lines of crests and troughs (see below).\nOcean swell diagram: https:\/\/oceanservice.noaa.gov\/education\/kits\/currents\/media\/supp_cur03a.html\nClick on the following link to see the wave energy in motion.\nhttps:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4a\/Deep_water_wave.gif We often see the ocean swell as parallel lines of crests and troughs.\nOcean swell approaching Lyttleton Harbour, New Zealand\nhttps:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Easterly_swell,_Lyttelton_Harbour,_29_July_2008.jpg\nAs the wave energy approaches a coastline the energy interacts with the sea floor, thereby lifting\nup the water surface to form an approaching wave. The sea bed slows down the bottom of the\nwave while the crest of the wave continues along at a faster speed, causing the wave to become\nprogressively steeper until it eventually breaks on the coastline.\nLarge surf at Mavericks. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Big_wave_surfing#\/media\/File:2010_mavericks_competition.jpg On rocky coastlines the wave energy dissipates as the wave crashes against a coastal cliff.\nWave at Shelter Cove,\nCalifornia.https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/b1\/Waves_Crashing_on_Rocks_%28910358858%29.jpg\/8\n00px-Waves_Crashing_on_Rocks_%28910358858%29.jpg\nWave at Santa Cruz, CA https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3a\/Storm_waves_in_Santa_Cruz.png Where a beach exists, the water will break within the surf zone and propel a rush of water\n(known as swash) to the higher reaches of the beach.\nBeach Swash https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/5\/55\/Swash_Lano_Beach_Samoa.JPG\/800px-\nSwash_Lano_Beach_Samoa.JPG\nThis water then migrates slowly back (known as backwash) to the ocean. In addition to the\nsaltwater, sediments are carried toward the beach in the swash, while sediments are carried back\ntoward the ocean in the backwash (more on this below).\nCheck out this YouTube link of swash and backwash.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HNwRrvjwMSQ\nThere are two major types of waves. Constructive Waves are short in height and have a low\nfrequency (fewer waves arrive per minute). These waves have strong swash compared to\nbackwash, so they tend to deposit sediment onto the beach. Constructive waves are more\ncommon during the California summer compared to winter.\nDestructive Waves are taller, have a higher frequency and contain more energy. Destructive\nwaves have a weak swash component compared to their backwash, so they tend to erode the\nbeach as the backwash returns to the ocean.\nThe sediments along a coastline undergo multiple cycles of erosion, transportation and\ndeposition by both constructive and destructive waves. Ultimately, coastal sediments are broken\ninto ever-smaller fragments, transported and deposited offshore. Silt, sand and coarser sediment\nare deposited onto the continental shelf while clay particles tend to be transported far offshore,\nadding a thin layer (just a few millimeters) of clay particles to the deep ocean floor every\nthousand years. http:\/\/www.boscorf.org\/repository\/curatorial-reference\/accumulation-rates COASTAL LANDFORMS\nCoastal landforms are classified into two major groups: erosional landforms and\ndepositional landforms.\nDepositional Landforms\nSediments are continuously eroded from coastlines or transported onto coastlines as rivers empty\ninto the sea. In general, the larger rock fragments (boulders, pebbles, gravel and sand) remain\nclose to the coastline, while finer sediments (silt and clay) remain suspended in the seawater for\nmuch longer, are transported further offshore and are deposited in the deep ocean. Sand-size\ngrains tend to remain in the beach zone and are constantly being shifted by swash and backwash\nof waves. Since most waves tend to hit the coastline at a slightly oblique angle, the sand grains\nare slowly but constantly shifted along (parallel to) to the beach, a process is referred to as\nLongshore drift.\nLongshore Drift. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Longshore_drift.svg\nLongshore drift is responsible for the transport of enormous amounts of sediment along the\ncoastline. Along the Southern California coastline much of the sand-sized sediment being\ntransported along the coast will eventually enter a submarine canyon and be deposited onto the\ncontinental shelf. Prior to this, longshore drift can create several distinct depositional landforms\nfrom the sand including beaches, spits, bars and tombolos. Let\u2019s explore these in greater detail:\nBeaches:\nA beach is an area of coastal sediment exposed to wave action. A beach profile can change from\nsummer to winter due to the seasonal change in the type of wave types that pound the beach.\nDuring the height of winter, when storm waves are more frequent, beach sediments can be\neroded from the beach. This \u2018bare bones\u2019 winter beach is referred to as the winter profile. The\nsediment eroded from the winter beach is temporarily deposited as sandbanks just beyond the\nsurf zone. During the summer months, when the surf is generally milder, the sediment stored in\nthe sand banks is transported towards the land, and deposited onto the beach. This is referred to\nas the beach\u2019s summer profile.

McLaughlin\nThe Earth\u2019s rivers, and the landscapes that are created by them, are the subject of this chapter.\nThe rivers and the freshwater that flows in them are primarily responsible for sculpting the\nsurface of the land into the myriad of landforms that we see each day.\nRUNOFF\nFluvial processes (or surface water processes) on land are the ultimate step in Earth\u2019s \u201cWater\nCycle\u201d. After precipitation over land, the water must return to its origin, the World\u2019s oceans,\nand thereby begin the cycle again. This return is mostly accomplished by runoff through rivers\nor streams (used interchangeably herein). Runoff is not consistent throughout the seasons or\nfrom year to year. Some streams are only \u201cEphemeral\u201d, meaning that they carry water only\nperiodically after substantial precipitation. This is especially true in regions that are arid. For\nexample, the Mojave River in Southern California normally only carries water a few weeks out\nof the year, but when it does so, it is often in torrential amounts.\nAs shown in the USGS Water Cycle diagram (below), evaporation exceeds precipitation over the\noceans. The excess moisture is transported over the land by advection (wind) before falling on\nthe land in the form of precipitation. The majority of this water is returned to the oceans by\nrunoff. This should look familiar since we initially discussed the Water Cycle in Chapter 6.\nUSGS Water Cycle Diagram. https:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/edu\/watercycle.html FLUVIAL ENERGY\nRunoff is the result of a battle between two Earth forces. These forces are gravity and friction.\n\u201cGravity\u201d is a force of attraction between two distinct bits of physical matter and depends upon\ntheir mass and distance from each other. \u201cFriction\u201d is an opposing force to gravity that resists\nor retards the motion of matter.\nOver time, Earth\u2019s gravity tends to move materials, including water, to the lowest available\nelevations. On Earth\u2019s surface the lowest elevations are at sea level, or in some instances even\nbelow sea level. For example, Badwater Basin in Death Valley, California is actually 282 feet\nbelow sea level. Accordingly, gravity pulls water on land down to sea level, unless it is trapped\nin a lowland basin. The term used to describe the lowest elevation is \u201cBase Level\u201d, a concept\noriginally formulated by the great American hydrologist and explorer, John Wesley Powell\n(1834-1902). A river can be defined as the path followed by liquid water to the lowest available\nelevation.\nOn the other hand, the path is not free from obstacles. The riverbed is obviously made up of\nEarth materials, such as vegetation, rocks, and soil. These materials are in contact with the\nwater molecules, and because of friction, disrupt and retard their flow. In other words, these\nmaterials work against the pull of gravity.\nDRAINAGE BASINS\nThe fundamental unit of fluvial processes is the \u201cDrainage Basin\u201d or \u201cWatershed\u201d. A Drainage\nBasin is that area within which all water flows toward a common point, as a result of the\nsurrounding topography. That common point is usually the main trunk of a stream system.\nA Drainage Basin can be as small\nas a few square miles or over one\nmillion square miles. For example,\nthe Mississippi-Missouri River\nsystem flows from a Drainage\nBasin that is about 1,244,000\nsquare miles (3,222,000 square\nkm) or about 2\/5 the size of the\ncontiguous United States.\nFrequently, many smaller\nDrainage Basins are nested within\na larger Drainage Basin.\nMISSISSIPPI-MISSOURI DRAINAGE BASIN\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; http:\/\/water.epa.gov\/type\/watersheds\/named\/msbasin\/marb_pop1.cfm\nSimply put, there are two main topographic components to a Drainage Basin, \u201cInterfluves\u201d and\n\u201cValleys\u201d. Interfluves are those higher elevation areas between valleys that generate overland water flow toward the valleys. In contrast, valleys are those lower lying areas that hold the\nestablished streams.\nSTREAM PATTERNS\nIn essence, streams simply follow the pull of gravity as influenced by topography and underlying\nbedrock. If the underlying bedrock is uniform in strength, the pattern is \u201cDendritic\u201d, similar to\nthat of a tree with many branches. Unlike a Dendritic stream, other streams are influenced by\nthe varying strengths of the bedrock. These include the \u201cTrellis\u201d pattern, which is formed\nbecause of alternating hard and soft folded strata. The resulting topography is ridges and\nvalleys. This is typical of the Appalachian Region in the Eastern United States. The streams in\nthis Region follow a pattern with many running parallel to each other but then abruptly\nchanging direction at a 90 degree angle as they follow the ridges and valleys. Other streams\nthat are influenced by the underlying geologic structure include the \u201cradial\u201d, \u201crectangular\u201d and\neven the \u201cderanged\u201d, which follows a haphazard pattern, frequently the result of recent glacial\nactivity which has disrupted the prior topography.\nDENDRITIC PATTERN TRELLIS PATTERN\nSTREAM ORDER\nThe structure of a stream tends to follow a hierarchical order. The tributary branching pattern is\nthe basis for this hierarchical system. A \u201cTributary\u201d is simply a branch whose water flows into a\nlarger branch or segment of the same river system. By giving each tributary a numeric value we\nare able to analyze and compare different stream systems and their relative water discharges.\nThis is especially applicable in analyzing a Dendritic stream system.\nThere are many different ways to order streams. However, one of the most useful is the\n\u201cStrahler\u201d method, which provides that the initial small tributaries that constitute the\nheadwaters or origin of the system are 1st order streams. Two 1st order streams must join\ntogether to make a 2nd order stream, and two 2nd order streams must join to make a 3rd order\nstream, etc. Interestingly, the mighty Mississippi River is classified as a 10th order stream. As the\nstream order increases (e.g. from 1 to 3 etc.) the following rules become evident:\n1. Gradient or steepness decrease\n2. Channel length and channel size increase\n3. Drainage Basin size increases\n4. Water volume or discharge amount increases The \u201cGradient\u201d of a stream can be defined as: ELEVATION CHANGE_________\nDISTANCE (NUMBER OF MILES)\nAn example would be: 800 FEET\n2 MILES = 400 FEET PER MILE\nIn other words, for every mile the river travels there is 400 feet of elevation change.\nUSGS National Biological Information Infrastructure;\nhttp:\/\/www.nbii.gov\/portal\/server.pt?open=512&objID=1345&mode=2&cached=true\nCHANNEL PATTERNS\nThe shape of a river channel is the result of many factors, including water volume, water\nvelocity, makeup of the channel banks and underlying bedrock, and the amount of sediment\nbeing carried. There are four main kinds of channel patterns, \u201cStraight\u201d, \u201cSinuous\u201d,\n\u201cMeandering\u201d, and \u201cBraided\u201d.\nThe straight, sinuous, and meandering rivers are defined by the bends or curvature of their\nchannels; the straight being the least curved and the meandering being distinctly curved. In\nnature, straight channels are not common and are usually short lived. Because of the\ndifferences in bank strength, friction, and water speed, the water usually flows in a curved \u201cS\u201d\nshaped pattern, and over time, the channel shape also takes on this pattern. The fastest flowing\npart of the river is called the \u201cThalweg\u201d and is located near the surface in the center of the\nriver. The water flows fastest in the Thalweg because there is less friction. The water flow on\none side of the Thalweg is usually somewhat slower than on the other side due to differences in\nbank friction, which results in alternating erosion on the faster side and deposition on the\nslower side. A braided stream is the result of a river carrying large amounts of sediment, which is dropped in\nthe channel when the water volume or velocity decreases. The sediment is deposited in bars\nand small islands that separate the river into strands, similar to a braid. In the diagram below\n\u201cD\u201d depicts a braided stream and \u201cE\u201d depicts a typical meandering stream.\nUSGS National Biological Information Infrastructure\nhttp:\/\/www.nbii.gov\/portal\/server.pt?open=512&objID=1345&PageID=7174&mode=2&in_hi_userid=2&cached=true\nSTREAM LOAD\nMost people have observed that streams carry water, but in reality there is much more than\nmeets the eye. Not only do rivers transport water back to the oceans, but they also transport\nbits and pieces of the land, in both solid and chemical form. The stream load can be divided into\n\u201cDissolved Load\u201d \u201cSuspended Load\u201d and \u201cBed Load\u201d.\nDissolved Load is derived from the chemical weathering of rocks such as limestone, which is\neasily broken down by water. The chemicals that make up limestone are carried in solution by\nthe river. Elements such as sodium, magnesium, and calcium are readily soluble in water.\nSuspended Load is made up of the finest minute particles that are too buoyant to sink to the\nriver bottom and are suspended due to the turbulence and flow of the river. This is similar to\nthe fine dust particles that are carried within the atmosphere by the wind. The Mississippi River\nis referred to as the \u201cBig Muddy\u201d because of its large suspended load. The Suspended Load\nremains until the river\u2019s velocity decreases dramatically and then it sinks to the bottom as silt.\nBed Load is made up of the larger rocks and loose material that are pushed along the river\nbottom by \u201cSaltation\u201d (bouncing) and \u201cTraction\u201d (rolling), as gravity pulls them and the water\ndown to the lowest elevation (i.e. the River\u2019s Base Level). As the bed load moves along with the\nwater, the materials are mechanically worn down by friction with the River bottom and other\nrocks and particles that are being carried. This explains the smooth and rounded shape of many\nstream rocks and boulders. SUSPENDED LOAD AND BED LOAD.

Erosion is the removal of material from one place to another after it has been\nchemically or mechanically broken down by destructive atmospheric processes. Deposition is\nthe other side of the process. The material that has been eroded and transported is deposited\nat another location. Of course, deposition at a specific location is not permanent. It is often one\nof numerous temporary stops along the path back to the lowest elevation, the ocean or inland\nbasin.\nEROSION - CUTTING\nAs the river moves across the landscape it attempts to follow the most direct route to its final\ndestination. In doing so, it sculpts the landscape as it back-cuts, down-cuts, and side-cuts. \u201cBack\ncutting\u201d involves \u201cHeadward\u201d erosion, as the river cuts into the surrounding interfluves in the\nupstream direction. The abundant water flow that forms the source of the river erodes the\nsides of the adjacent interfluves and transforms them into an extension of the river valley. This\nlengthens the river valley and diminishes the size of the interfluves.\n\u201cDown-cutting\u201d occurs as the river seeks its base level. The riverbed is eroded downward by\nthe force of the water, its elevation is reduced, and the valley is deepened. Down-cutting is\nmost dramatic in the upper levels of the river. As the river approaches sea level, down-cutting\ngreatly diminishes. One of the most dramatic examples of down-cutting is the Grand Canyon of\nArizona. Over about 17 million years the Colorado River has down-cut more than one mile\ncreating the spectacular canyon walls.\nAlso, when down-cutting is the prevalent force, especially in higher elevations, \u201cKnickpoints\u201d\nare formed in the riverbed. They form because of the variations in the strength of the bedrock.\nWhere it is more easily eroded, a knickpoint forms. The knickpoint erosion results in rapid drops\nin the elevation of the riverbed and gives rise to beautiful fluvial formations such as rapids and\nwaterfalls. KNICKPOINTS AND RAPIDS GRAND CANYON - ARIZONA\n\u201cSide-cutting\u201d occurs because of the lateral movement or migration of the river along the\nvalley floor. The path of the river is extremely dynamic, constantly changing course within its\nflood plain. As the stream leaves its headwaters and the higher elevations, its energy is\ntransferred from down-cutting to side-cutting. As mentioned previously, the water flow of a\nriver is naturally meandering, in an \u201cS\u201d shaped pattern. As the river\u2019s energy is devoted to side-\ncutting, the meanders become more exaggerated. Since the water moves faster and with more\nforce on the outside of the \u201cS\u201d curve, it is there that much of the erosion takes place creating\nan \u201cUndercut Bank\u201d. The sides of the valley are widened and cut into steep banks or bluffs.\nMoreover, mass wasting often takes place along the edge of the river, contributing further to\nthe erosion of the surrounding terrain.\nUNDERCUT BANK \u2013 RIVER TAY - SCOTLAND Tay District Salmon Fisheries Board; http:\/\/www.tdsfb.org\/river-tay.htm MEANDER SCARS AND OXBOW LAKES\n\u201cMeander Scars\u201d and \u201cOxbow Lakes\u201d are the result of both erosion and deposition. As\nmeandering becomes more extreme, eventually one meander will cut off another, and the river\nwill change course. The old meander will be abandoned and the river will flow along the new\nmeander. Water will likely remain for a time in the old meander and form an Oxbow Lake,\nsimilar in shape to the yokes used by oxen in the early period of settlement in the United\nStates. Over time, deposition will prevail over erosion, and the Oxbow Lake will fill with\nsediment and vegetation, leaving only a scar on the land where the meander used to be.\nWILLIAMS RIVER \u2013 ALASKA OXBOW LAKE FORMATION\nUtrecht University Netherlands; http:\/\/www.geo.uu.nl\/fg\/palaeogeography\/results\/fluvialstyle\nDEPOSITION \u2013 POINT BARS AND NATURAL LEVEES\nThe erosion caused by side-cutting and meandering has been discussed above. As mentioned,\nthe fastest water travels on the outside of the meander curve. Conversely, the slower moving\nwater travels on the inside curve of the meander. Anyone who has thrown a leaf or twig into a\nstream has likely seen this difference in speed. Because of the decrease in water flow on the\ninside of the curve, the stream can no longer carry the same load. It therefore deposits some of\nits bed load and even possibly its suspended load at the curve. This deposit is called a \u201cPoint\nBar\u201d. The river then has an alternating pattern of erosion on one side (e.g. an undercut bank)\nand deposition on the other (e. g. a point bar).\n\u201cNatural Levees\u201d occur when a river floods beyond its existing banks and deposits some of its\nstream load on the adjacent flood plain. Because of down-cutting, the riverbed is confining and\noften lower than the surrounding flood plain. When it floods and the water tops the existing\nbanks, the water speed diminishes because it is no longer confined to a narrow channel. As a\nresult of the decreased water velocity, the river deposits its sediment which forms a natural\nlevee or ridge along the existing channel border. These levees frequently grow in height and\nsize with each succeeding flood. When the levees break or are breached during a flood there\ncan be devastating consequences for anyone living within the flood plain. For example, great destruction resulted in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina when the Mississippi River levees\nwere breached.\nSACRAMENTO RIVER LEVEE (as modified by humans)\nSacramento River Watershed Program, http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Sacramento_River_Levee.jpg\nALTERNATING DEPOSITION AND EROSION POINT BARS AND CUTBANKS\nDEPOSITION \u2013 ALLUVIAL FANS AND DELTAS\nWhen river flow decreases in velocity or volume the sediments carried in the water become too\nheavy to transport and drop to the bottom. This is especially evident when a river approaches its base level, empties into a lake or the ocean, or leaves the confines of the river channel. The\nmaterial that is deposited is generally called \u201cAlluvium\u201d. The largest material is dropped first\nfollowed by the smaller material. Accordingly, there is a natural sorting of alluvium by size.\nBoth \u201cAlluvial Fans\u201d and \u201cDeltas\u201d form as a result of the process described above. Alluvial fans\nare quite conspicuous in arid environments (as we discussed previously) where the streams are\nephemeral and they exit from a mountain canyon onto a flatter plain. As the mountain stream\nenters the plain its speed decreases markedly and the material is dropped in order of its size.\nWith a Delta, the river has reached its base level as it enters a body of water. The force of the\nriver is dissipated as it joins the lake or ocean and the stream load is deposited in a triangular or\nfan shaped pattern. Interestingly, the river forms many small parallel channels in the Delta\ncalled \u201cDistributaries\u201d. These follow a pattern that is the reverse of the Dendritic stream\npattern mentioned earlier, with the Distributaries branching off of the main trunk of the river\nrather than merging with the main trunk.\nALLUVIAL FAN \u2013 SOUTHERN IRAN DELTA \u2013 LAKE AYAKUM - TIBETNASA-\nEarth Observatory; http:\/\/earthobservatory.nasa.gov\/Images\/\nCONCLUSION\nRivers sculpt and shape the land that we live on. Running water is the primary agent of erosion\nand deposition. While water may be seen as the sculptor's tool, gravity provides the energy for\noperating the tool. The landforms and features that are made by running water range from\nmagnificent canyons and waterfalls to mundane piles of sand and nondescript gullies. However,\nthe rocks, soil, water, and chemicals that are components of the fluvial system are all essential\nto the cycle of life that makes Earth unique in the Universe. "}
