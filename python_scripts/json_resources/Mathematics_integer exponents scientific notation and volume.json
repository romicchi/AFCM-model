Chapter 8: Integer Exponents, Scientific Notation\nand Volume (4 weeks)\nUtah Core Standard(s):\n\uf0b7 Know and apply the properties of integer exponents to generate equivalent numerical expressions. For\n1 1\nexample, 32\u00d73-5=3-3= = . (8.EE.1)\n33 27\n\uf0b7 Use numbers expressed in the form of a single digit times an integer power of 10 to estimate very large\nor very small quantities, and to express how many times as much one is than the other. For example,\nestimate the population of the United States as 3\u00d7108and the population of the world as7\u00d7109, and\ndetermine that the world population is more than 20 times larger. (8.EE.3)\n\uf0b7 Perform operations with numbers expressed in scientific notation, including problems where both\ndecimal and scientific notation are used. Use scientific notation and choose units of appropriate size for\nmeasurement of very large and very small quantities (e.g., use millimeters per year for seafloor\nspreading). Interpret scientific notation that has been generated by technology. (8.EE.4)\n\uf0b7 Know the formulas for volumes of cones, cylinders, and spheres and use them to solve real-world and\nmathematical problems. (8.G.9)\nVocabulary: base, cone, cylinder, diameter, estimate, exponent, exponential form, hemisphere, scientific\nnotation, pi, power, powers of ten, radius, scientific notation, slant height, sphere, standard form, volume\nChapter Overview:\nStudents begin this chapter with the study of integer exponents. They represent repeated multiplication in\nexponential form and begin to explore the properties of integer exponents as another method for transforming\nexpressions. Students explore problems and patterns that lead them to properties related to negative exponents\nand an exponent of 0. Through the investigation of these properties they learn to generate equivalent\nexpressions in a quick and efficient way. Their study is then turned to using their knowledge of exponents,\nplace value, and powers of ten to express a number in scientific notation. This notation is used to denote very\nsmall and very large numbers. Students learn to change numbers from standard form to scientific notation and\nvice versa. They also learn to perform operations with numbers in scientific notation. This enables them to\nwork with and analyze real world situations where large and small quantities exist. Finally, students study\nvolume and how exponents play a role in the formulas for the volume of a cylinder, cone, and sphere. They use\nthese formulas to solve a variety of problems related to the volume of these three-dimensional objects.\n8WB8-2 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

Connections to Content:\nPrior Knowledge:\nPrior to 8th grade students have explained patterns in the number of zeros of the product when multiplying a\nnumber by a power of ten. They have also analyzed the patterns in the placement of the decimal point when a\ndecimal is multiplied or divided by a power of 10. In addition they have used whole number exponents to\ndenote powers of 10. They extend this knowledge to base numbers other than 10 in 8th grade as they generate\nthe exponent rules. In addition to rewriting numbers as powers of ten to better understand multiplication and\nplace value students have previously rewritten numbers in a variety of ways to perform an indicated skill, i.e.,\n24 as 2\uf0b42\uf0b42\uf0b43 and 18 as2\uf0b43\uf0b43, to reduce to or to find the LCM of 72 or GCF of 6. Similarly, in 8th\ngrade, students express numbers as decimals or in scientific notation in order to compare and estimate very\nlarge and small quantities. Finally, students must gather their knowledge of area and volume from 6th and 7th\ngrade as they begin their work with volumes of cylinders, cones, and spheres.\nFuture Knowledge:\nA solid foundation with exponent laws and rules will help students significantly as they begin to transform more\ncomplicated expressions in high school mathematics courses. For example, in Secondary II they will extend the\nlaws of exponents to rational exponents. In high school students will explore exponential functions and the\nwork they do in 8th grade begins to familiarize them with how exponents work algebraically and how\nexponential behavior is exhibited. Scientific notation will be used in a variety of contexts in high school\nmathematics and science courses. By studying the volume formulas for cylinders, cones, and spheres in 8th\ngrade, students will be prepared to investigate informal arguments and proofs, specifically Cavalieri\u2019s Principle\nfor the derivation of these formulas in Secondary II.\nMany of the section lessons in this chapter may take more than one day to complete\ndepending on the length of your class period. Think about the needs of your students and pace\nthe lessons and homework assignments according to their needs.\n8WB8-3 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

If you fill the hemisphere with water or other filling material, predict\nwhat fraction of the cylinder is filled by the volume of one hemisphere.\n2. Now try it, what fraction of the cylinder is filled by the volume of one\nhemisphere?\nReason 3. Write down the equation for the volume of the cylinder below the\nabstractly and cylinder, be sure to write your height in terms of the radius or r.\nquantitatively. 4. Manipulate the equation for the volume of the cylinder to show the\nvolume of the hemisphere.\n5. Now double your formula to find the formula for the volume of a\nsphere.\nStudents derive the formula for the volume of a sphere by physically comparing\nthe volume of a sphere to that of a cylinder. Based on the physical differences\ndiscovered, students manipulate the formula for the volume of a cylinder in\norder to derive the formula for the volume of a sphere. They use a similar\nprocess to derive the formula for the volume of a cone. They must algebraically\ninterpret these changes as they reason abstractly about the dimensions dealt\nwith. They can then make the appropriate changes as they manipulate the\nformulas.\nDiscuss the multiplication problem(5\uf0b43)(2\uf0b48)with your class. Write your\nthoughts below.\nOf course it most natural to just multiply 15 times 16. But could you rewrite\nthe problem as(5\uf0b42)(3\uf0b48)or(5\uf0b48)(2\uf0b43)? Is the answer the same? Why\ncan you do this?\nLook for and\nRewrite this problem (5.1\uf0b4105)(6.8\uf0b4103)like the problem above (group the\nmake use of\npowers of 10 together). Then solve the problem (use exponent properties)\nstructure.\nand write the solution.\nLooking for structure is a big part of this chapter. The example above is\nshowing how the structure of a number written in scientific notation can aid in\ncompleting basic operations of very large and small numbers in a fast and\nefficient way. The students will also make use of structure when they look at\nhow exponents are used to represent repeated multiplication. This in turn\npoints toward the discovery and understanding of the exponent properties and\nrules.\nAnalyze the pairs of expressions given below; discuss the similarities and\ndifferences between them.\n(\uf02d4)2 \uf02d42\nand\n(\uf02d4)3 \uf02d43\nand\nStudents might bring up the fact that the only thing that is different about the first\nset of expressions are the parentheses. The parentheses are important because they\nindicate that there are two copies of negative 4. If you expand this expression you\nAttend to get . The expression\uf02d42 indicates that there is a coefficient of\nprecision.\nnegative 1. Upon expansion, you get \uf02d4 2\uf03d(\uf02d1)(4)(4)\uf03d(\uf02d1)(16)\uf03d\uf02d16 . Students\nwill get different answers even though the expressions are similar. They must\nattend to precision. In the second set of expressions they both equal . This is\nbecause of the odd exponent. Throughout the chapter students must attend to\nprecision constantly as they grapple with the notation used with exponents and as\nthey decipher what these special notations are communicating to them.\n8WB8-4 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

As you are simplifying try to\ndiscover a shortcut or rule that you could use to simplify more quickly.\nTest your shortcut in the last column and compare your answers.\nProduct of Powers\nLook for and\nexpress\nregularity in\nrepeated\nreasoning.\nThroughout section 8.1 students will expand expressions repeatedly in\norder to discover the rules and properties of integer exponents.\nYou are asked to enter the following expression into your scientific\ncalculator.\n4\n\uf0e62\uf0f6\nUse\n\uf0e7 \uf0f7\nappropriate \uf0e83\uf0f8\ntools Which of the following is not a correct way to enter the expression into a\nstrategically. scientific calculator?\nUsing a calculator appropriately is an important component of this chapter.\nStudents often mistake how to enter exponents into the calculator correctly.\nThey must also learn how to enter and interpret a number expressed in\nscientific notation on a calculator.\nGas\u2019N\u2019 Go Convenience Stores claim that 10% of Utahans fuel up at their\nstores each week. Decide whether their claim is true using the following\ninformation.\n\uf0b7 There are about 2.85\uf0b4106people in Utah.\nMake sense of \uf0b7 There are 2.18\uf0b4102Gas\u2019N\u2019Go stores in Utah.\nproblems and\n\uf0b7 Each stations serves gasoline to about 1.2\uf0b4103people each\npersevere in\nweek.\nsolving them.\nThere are several questions in this chapter where students are given the\nopportunity to problem solve. In the example above students must find an\nentry point into the problem by determining that they need to figure out\nwhat 10% of the Utah population is. They must analyze what is given to\nthem and how they can use it to reach their intended goal. In addition to\nreaching an outcome they can analyze their solution to see if it makes sense\ngiven the context.\n8WB8-5 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education. Licensed under Creative Commons, cc-by. Edward, Pattie, and Mitch were each simplifying the same exponential\nexpression. Their work is shown below. Determine who has simplified the\nexpression correctly. If they did not simplify the expression correctly, identify\nthe mistake, explain it, and fix it.\nConstruct\nviable\narguments and\ncritique the\nreasoning of\nothers.\nIn the problem above students must critique the work of others. As they do so they\nsolidify their understanding of different exponent properties. They also analyze\ncommon misconceptions and mistakes that are made when simplifying expressions\nwith exponents. As they examine two problems that are correct but simplified\ndifferently they see that it is possible to arrive at the same answer in a variety of\nways. This enhances their understanding of the structure of these expressions and\nhow they are composed.\nA silo is a storage bin that is a cylinder with a hemisphere on top. A farmer\nhas a silo with a base radius of 30 feet and a storage height of 100 feet. The\n\u201cstorage height\u201d is the part which can be filled with grain - it is just the\ncylinder. A cubic foot of grain weighs 62 lbs.\na. Draw and label a picture of the silo.\nb. How many pounds of grain can the farmer store in the silo?\nc. How high (including the hemispherical top) is the silo?\nd. 1000 square feet of wheat produces 250 pounds of grain. The farmer\u2019s\nModel with wheat field is 3,500 ft by 20,000 ft. Is the silo large enough to hold the\nmathematics. grain? By how much? Explain your answer.\ne. If the farmer decides to fill the silo all the way to the top of the hemisphere\nhow many cubic feet of grain can he store?\nWhile working with volume students use geometry to model a variety of situations. In\nthe problem above, a silo is modeled with a hemisphere and cylinder. Student\u2019s use\nthis geometric model to answer questions about the silo. They use a mathematical\nformula to model the volume of the silo to determine how much grain it will hold and\nthe height of the silo.\n8WB8-6 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

If Spider Man weighs roughly 185 pounds how many spiders does it take to have the same\nmass as Spider Man?\nIt would take roughly 84,600 spiders in order to equal the mass of Spider Man.\n2. Spider Man fights evil villains in New York City. The size of New York City is roughly 1,214,450,000\nsquare meters. It is estimated that on average there are approximately 1,308 spiders per square meter of\nland. Use this information to determine how many spiders are in New York City?\nThere are approximately 1,589,000,000,000 spiders in New York City.\nBonus: Determine how many spiders there are in your city or even a bedroom in your basement.\nThis task is intended to introduce students to very large and very small numbers. In this chapter\nstudents will learn how to use exponents to express numbers in scientific notation. At this point let\nstudents try to answer the questions using any method they can. After doing section 8.2, where students\nwill learn how to express a number in scientific notation, return to this task and have them answer the\nquestions using scientific notation. They will see how using scientific notation as a tool when\nappropriate can help them to better make sense of and calculate quantities with ease and efficiency.\n8WB8-7 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

Section 8.1: Integer Exponents\nSection Overview:\nThis section begins with an overview of the structure of exponents and how an exponential expression\nrepresents repeated multiplication as opposed to expressions that represent repeated addition. Using the\nstructure of an exponential expression special properties or rules are discovered in this section. These exponent\nproperties and rules aid in simplifying exponential expressions. Students will informally prove why an exponent\n1\nof zero equals one and also look at the definition of negative exponents, that is,x\uf02d1 \uf03d . Once students become\nx\nfamiliar with these properties and rules they use them to simplify more complex exponential expressions.\nConcepts and Skills to Master:\nBy the end of this section students should be able to:\n1. Apply the properties of integer exponents to simplify algebraic and numerical expressions.\nBe sure to reference the teacher notes for section 8.1. They will give you important guidelines as to\nhow group and class discussions will aid in the discovery of exponent properties. The \u201cFind, Fix, and\nJustify\u201d activities are meant to help students solidify the properties of exponents by reasoning about\nhow algebraic expressions are expanded and can be simplified through basic algebraic properties. As\nthey look for mistakes i n algebraic reasoning and argue or justify their thinking a deeper\nunderstanding of how the expressions are constructed emerges and solidifies how expanding an\nexpression can lead to a shortcut or rule.\n8WB8-8 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

In such a\ntournament, we start with a certain number of teams, and we pair them off into games; each team plays a game.\nThis is called the first round. All the losers in the first round are eliminated; in the second round all the winning\nteams are paired off into games, and all the second round losers are eliminated. This process continues until\nonly two teams remain; this is the final round and the winner is the champion of the tournament.\nFor the March Madness problem consider showing students a bracket for the current year\u2019s tournament and explain\nto them the following.\nSince there are two teams in the final round, there had to be four teams in the semifinal round, and thus eight teams\nin the preceding round and so forth. So, for a single elimination tournament to work, with no teams ever idle, that we\nstart with a number of teams that is a power of two, and that exponent is the number of rounds. So, for example, if we\nstart with 16 teams, since , there are 4 rounds and games.\n12. March Madness starts with 64 teams. How many rounds are there?\nSince , there are six rounds.\n13. How many teams are in the second round? In any round?\nEach round eliminates half the remaining teams, so there are 32 teams in the second round, 16 in the\nthird, and so forth.\n14. How many games total are played? There are games. Another way of\ncounting is that there are 63 teams that are NOT champions, and each game produces one non-\nchampion.\n8WB8-11 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

In order to properly access and\nunderstand how scientific notation works students must have a solid foundation of place value and how powers\nof ten show the relationship between digits that are next to each other in a multi-digit number. They will use this\nfoundation to compare numbers written as a single digit times an integer power of ten by a scale factor. After\nreviewing place value students learn to change numbers between standard form and scientific notation in order\nto estimate very large and very small quantities. Students also learn how to operate with numbers in scientific\nnotation so they can compare and express how many times as much one number is to another. As they are\nproblem solving with scientific notation they must choose units of appropriate size for measurements of very\nlarge or very small quantities. Finally, students will use scientific notation to solve in a variety of contexts that\nrequire the use of very large and very small numbers.\nConcepts and Skills to master:\nBy the end of this section students should be able to:\n1. Use numbers expressed in the form of a single digit times an integer power of 10 to estimate very large\nor very small quantities, and to express how many times as much one is than the other.\n2. Convert a number between scientific notation and standard form.\n3. Perform operations with numbers expressed in scientific notation.\n4. Choose units of appropriate size for measurements of very large or very small quantities.\n5. Interpret scientific notation that has been generated by technology.\n6. Use scientific notation to problem solve with really small and really large numbers.\n8WB8-35 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

It is a prerequisite standard for\nstudents to fully understand scientific notation which is why we are reviewing it here.\n11. Daxton\u2019s Candy (adapted from an Illustrative Mathematics Task)\na. Daxton has a digital scale. He puts a Marshmallow Peep on the scale and it reads 6.2 grams. How\nmuch would you expect 10 Marshmallow Peeps to weigh? Why?\nTen Marshmallow Peeps will weigh 62 grams. You can move the decimal one space to the right to\nmultiply by ten.\nb. Daxton takes the marshmallows off the scale. He then puts on 10 jellybeans and the scale reads 12.0\ngrams. How much would you expect 1 jellybean to weigh? Why?\nOne jellybean will weigh 1.2 grams. You can move the decimal one place to the left to divide by ten.\nc. Daxton then takes off the jellybeans and puts on 10 cinnamon bunnies. The scale reads 88.2 grams.\nHow much would you expect 1,000 cinnamon bunnies to weigh? Why? One thousand cinnamon\nbunnies will weigh 8820 grams. Since 1,000 is 100 times as much as 10 you want to multiply by\n100. You do this by moving the decimal two places to the right to multiply by 100.\nd.

Ten thousand is how many times bigger than 100? (Hint: Remember the statement you completed on the\nprevious page.)\n10,000 is 100 times bigger than 100.\nSpend some time investigating this problem. Use the statement on the previous page to help students\nrecognize that every additional digit or place value changes the number by a scale factor of 10. Since\nthere are two additional digits of 0 in 10,000 compared to 100, then the number changes by a factor of\n. Thus 10,000 is 100 times bigger than 100.\n14. Now write 100 and 10,000 as a single digit times an integer power of ten.\nand\nUse the powers of ten to determine how many times bigger 10,000 is than 100.\nThe difference between the powers of ten is so 10,000 is 100 times bigger than 100.\nStudents should answer the remaining problems by using what they know about powers of ten. They are\ntechnically also using scientific notation. However, the focus should be on how additional powers of ten\nincre ase the value of a number by a scale factor of 10. This is addressing standard 8.EE.3 which\nemp hasizes writing numbers as a single digit times an integer power of ten to estimate and make\ncom parisons.\n15.

In fact, texting allows us to\nabbreviate many common phrases. Mathematicians and scientists have a way of expressing really large and\nreally small numbers in a fast and efficient way; it is called Scientific Notation. Just like texting allows you to\ncommunicate quickly, scientific notation is a special way of writing a number that would otherwise be tedious\nto write if it were left in standard form. Scientific notation is very similar to writing a number as the product of a single\ndigit and an integer power of ten, a skill they learned in the previous section.\nThe four expressions written below represent the same number. Write the number in Standard Form on a\nsheet of paper or mini-white board.\nYou may need to remind them that a number written in standard form is writing a number using the digits 0-9;\nthis is the form in which they are used to writing numbers.\nDiscussion: What expression did you use to write the number in standard form? Why?\nCheck the other expressions to see if they give you the same number.\nAre all of these expressions written in scientific notation? (It is important to note that all of these expressions are\nwritten in Scientific Notation. However, the expression, , is the only expression written in what is called\n\u201cNormalized Scientific Notation\u201d. This particular way of writing an expression is often the preferred and only\naccepted form of scientific notation.)\nAt this point it is okay that students do not formally know how to change a number from standard form into\nscientific notation. This discussion is meant to help students begin to surface their ideas and background\nknowledge about scientific notation. Encourage students to share what they do know about converting between\nthe two forms.\nWhich of the expressions given below is greater?\nOnce students have decided which expression they think is bigger ask them to discuss their answer\nwith a neighbor. Then move to a group discussion, a common mistake is to ignore the exponents and\nassume that since 6 is twice as big as 3 the first expression is bigger. Or that since the first expression\nhas an exponent of -5 then it is bigger (even though -5 is smaller than -2). Begin to identify patterns.\nAsk them what they know about negative exponents. Tell students to write down key ideas in the\nblank space on this page.\n8WB8-43 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

Will the method for multiplying and dividing numbers in scientific notation work for adding and\nsubtracting numbers in scientific notation? No, since you are combining the operations of\naddition or subtraction with multiplication the commutative property does not hold.\nLead a discussion with students:\nConsider the numbers 5,000,000 and 2,000,000. If you were to add these numbers you would most likely\nadd 5 + 2, which equals 7. Then, since they both have six zeros you would add six zeros to get\n7,000,000. The same can be done with numbers in scientific notation.\n2. Rewrite 5,000,000 and 2,000,000 in scientific notation.\n5,000,000\uf03d5\uf0b4106\n2,000,000\uf03d2\uf0b4106\nL ead a discussion with students:\nN otice that they both have the same exponent. Similarly, if you add these numbers in scientific notation\ny ou can simply add 5+2 to get 7 and keep the 106. You get7\uf0b4106.\n3. Test the method you learned above to see if it works for subtraction. First subtract 2,000,000 from\n5,000,000. Then change the numbers to scientific notation and subtract them using the method above to\nsee if you get the same answer. You may want to give your students a few more examples to experiment with for\n5,000,000\uf02d2,000,000 them to see the pattern and formulize a method for adding and subtracting\nnumbers with the same power of ten. You can also think about the example\n\uf03d3,000,000\nabove like adding like terms. You have 5 millions and 2 millions when you add\nthem together to get 7 millions. Just like when you add 5x and 2x you get 7x. Or\n5\uf0b4106 \uf02d2\uf0b4106 \uf03d3\uf0b4106\nsimilarly, when you add .\n4. Write in your own words how to add or subtract numbers in scientific notation that have the same\nexponent or order of magnitude.\nSee student answer.\nAfter you have given students an opportunity to write their method in their own\nwords; summarize a method together as a class. Make sure that everyone understands\nthat they can perform the desired operation on the significant digits and keep the\norder of magnitude the same. Of course this will only work when the powers of ten\nare the same. We will discuss what to do if they are not the same shortly.\n5. Find each sum or difference.

Section 8.3: Volume of Cylinders, Cones, and Spheres\nSection Overview:\nThroughout this section, students are solving real-world and mathematical problems involving volumes of\ncylinders, cones, and spheres. Students begin by deriving the volume of a cylinder, relying on their knowledge\nfrom previous grades that the volume of a right three-dimensional object can be found by taking the area of its\nbase and multiplying it by the height. Students then use the formula for the volume of a cylinder to arrive at the\nformulas for the volumes of a cone and sphere. Using concrete models of these three-dimensional objects,\nstudents physically compare the volume of a cone to the volume of a cylinder. Students then manipulate the\nformula for the volume of a cylinder to reflect these differences, arriving at the formula for the volume of a\ncone. They use a similar process to derive the formula for the volume of a sphere. Once students understand\nwhere these formulas come from, they apply them to solve real-world problems, knowing when and how to use\nthe formulas.\nConcepts and Skills to be mastered:\nBy the end of this section students should be able to:\n1. Find the volume of a cylinder, cone, and sphere given a radius and height.\n2. Find a missing measurement (height, radius, or diameter) for a cylinder, cone, or sphere given the\nvolume.\n3. Use the formulas for the volumes of cylinders, cones, and spheres to solve a variety of real-world\nproblems.\nIt is particularly important to read the Mathematical Foundation for this section. It gives a more\ndetailed and historical discussion of how the formulas for the volume of a cylinder, cone, and sphere\nare derived, specifically, Cavalieri's principle and the packing of three (polyhedral) cones in a cube.\nTher e are so me great tasks found at the following links that are related to the content in this section.\nThe Popcorn task would be a good one to do with cylinders and the Meatball task would be good to do\nwith spheres. You can even use them as an assessment.\nhttp://threeacts.mrmeyer.com/popcornpicker/\nhttp://www.101qs.com/2352-meatballs\n*Both of these tasks were created by Dan Myer\n8WB8-72 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

You have learned how to simplify expressions with\nexponents in them and have looked at how expressing numbers in scientific notation can better help us deal with\nnumbers that are really big and really small. Exponents are also used to find the volume of a three-dimensional\nobject.\n1. Describe what volume is. Compare it to finding perimeter or area.\nAnswer may include that volume describes the amount of space that an object takes up or hold.\nCommon misconceptions might include that volume describes that area.\nTo help us better understand how important it is to know how to find the volume of a three-dimensional object\ndo the following activity.\n2. Choose two different sizes of cylindrical cans to use for this activity. Measure the diameter and the\nheight of each can in centimeters.\nCan 1: Diameter __________________ Height __________________\nCan 2: Diameter ___________________ Height __________________\n3. As a group determine the volume of each can. Show your work below or explain how you found the\nvolume of your cans. Make sure that your units are correct. Once you have found the volume in cubic\ncentimeters change your answer to millimeters. (Hint: One cubic centimeter is the same as one\nmilliliter.)\nCan 1 Can 2\nYo u could provide several different empty soup cans for students to choose from. Be sure to calculate\nthe volume of the can before you do the activity and remove an labels that may state the volume. In\nord er to measure the water you will need a graduated cylinder and a bucket of water, it is best to do\nthi s part of the activity outside. Do not let students use the graduated cylinder to calculate the volume.\nTh is activity is intended for students to start thinking critically about volume and how it is calculated.\nDo not tell the students how to find the volume of a cylinder or provide the formula. It definitely\nbri ngs out the need to attend to precision.\nSelect one of your cans and bring it up to the teacher with your calculation for the volume of the can. Also,\nselect one member of the team to test your calculations.\nThis will be done by having the teacher fill the can with water over a team member\u2019s head. If\nthey calculate too much the water will overflow onto their head and if their calculations are\ntoo low then all the water will get dumped on their head.\n4. Which can did your team choose and why did you choose this can?\nSee student answer.\n5. How close were your calculations to the actual volume of the can?\nSee student answer.\n6. What would you do differently if you could recalculate the volume of your can?\nSee student answer.\n8WB8-73 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

Describe how to find the volume of the pool for any given depth. To find the volume of the pool for any\ngiven depth, multiply the area of the pool by the depth of the pool.\nStudents have dealt with the formulas for the volume of prisms and pyramids in previous grades. If you\nfeel that your students basic knowledge of volume is lacking consider using colored linking cubes in\nthis activity. Have your students build the various volumes for Pools 1 and 2. The cubes will allow\nthem to see how volume is composed of the area of the base times the depth or height of the pool.\n8WB8-74 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

Use the information below\nto answer the questions that follow.\n5 cm 4 cm 4 cm\n3 cm\n8 cm 6 cm\n4 cm\nGlass 1 Gla ss 2 Glass 3\n\uf0b7 The shape of Glass 1 is a cone with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 8 cm.\n\uf0b7 The shape of Glass 2 is a cylinder with a radius of 4 cm and a height of 6 cm.\n\uf0b7 The shape of Glass 3 is a hemisphere with radius of 4 cm with a cylinder on top of it with a radius of\n4 cm and a height of 3 cm.\na. Suzy wants to choose the glass that has the smallest volume so that she doesn\u2019t have to use as much\npunch. Find the volume of each glass to determine which glass she should choose.\n200\nV \uf03d \uf070cm3 V \uf03d96\uf070cm3\nThe volume of Glass 1 is 3 . The volume of Glass 2 is .\nV \uf0bb301.59cm3\nV \uf0bb209.44cm3\n272\nV \uf03d \uf070cm3\nThe volume of Glass 3 is 3 .\nV \uf0bb284.83cm3\nSuzy should choose Glass 1 because it has the smallest volume and will hold the least amount of punch.\nb. Suzy really wants to use the cylinder shaped glass. What would the approximate height of the cylinder\nshaped glass need to be to hold the same amount of punch as the cone shaped glass. Would this be\npractical?\nThe height of the cylinder would need to be about 41.1 cm. It would not be practical to have a glass that\nis this tall.\n8WB8-92 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.
