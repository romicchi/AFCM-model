meet the criteria for the SA \\Outcomes Based\" syl-\nlabus of 2004. A few notes to authors:\nAll \\real world examples\" should be in the context of HIV/AIDS, labour\ndisputes,humanrights,social,economical,cultural,politicalandenvironmental\nissues. Unless otherwise stated in the syllabus. Where possible, every section\nshould have a practical problem.\nThe preferred method for disproving something is by counter example. Jus-\ntiflcation for any mathematical generalisations of applied examples is always\ndesired.\n2 Chapter 1\nNumbers\n(NOTE: more examples and motivation needed. perhaps drop the proofs for\nexponents and surds?)\nA number is a way to represent quantity. Numbers are not something that\nwe can touch or hold, because they are not physical. But you can touch three\napples,threepencils,threebooks. Youcanneverjusttouchthree,youcanonly\ntouch three of something. However, you don\u2019t need to see three apples in front\nof you to know that if you take one apple away, that there will be two apples\nleft. You can just think about it. That is your brain representing the apples in\nnumbers and then performing arithmetic on them.\nA number represents quantity because we can look at the world around us\nand quantify it using numbers. How many minutes? How many kilometers?\nHow many apples? How much money? How much medicine? These are all\nquestions which can only be answered using numbers to tell us \\how much\" of\nsomething we want to measure.\nAnumbercanbewrittenmanydifierentwaysanditisalwaysbesttochoose\nthe most appropriate way of writing the number. For example, the number \\a\nhalf\" may be spoken aloud or written in words, but that makes mathematics\nvery di\u2013cult and also means that only people who speak the same language as\nyou can understand what you mean. A better way of writing \\a half\" is as a\nfraction 1 or as a decimal number 0;5. It is still the same number, no matter\n2\nwhich way you write it.\nIn high school, all the numbers which you will see are called real num-\nbers(NOTE: Advanced: The name \\real numbers\" is used because there are\ndifierentandmorecomplicatednumbersknownas\\imaginarynumbers\",which\nthis book will not go into. Since we won\u2019t be looking at numbers which aren\u2019t\nreal, if you see a number you can be sure it is a real one.) and mathematicians\nusethesymbolRtostandforthesetofallrealnumbers,whichsimplymeansall\nof the real numbers. Some of these real numbers can be written in a particular\nway, but others cannot.\nThis chapter will explain difierent ways of writing any number, and when\neach way of writing the number is best.\n(NOTE: This intro needs more motivation for difierent types of numbers,\nsome real world examples and more interesting facts. Lets avoid the whole\ndifierent numeral systems though... maybe when we do the history edit near\nrelease.)\n3 1.1 Letters and Arithmetic\nThe syllabus requires:\nalgebraic manipulation is governed by the algebra of the real\n\u2020\nnumbers\nmanipulate equations (rearrange for y, expand a squared bracket)\n\u2020\n(NOTE: \\algebra of the Reals\". why letters are useful... very simple exam-\nple, likechangefromashop. brackets, squaredbrackets, fractions, multiplytop\nand bottom. rearranging. doing something to one side and the other.)\nWhenyouadd,subtract,multiplyordividetwonumbers,youareperforming\narithmetic1. These four basic operations (+; ; ; ) can be performed on any\n\u00a1 \u00a3 \u00a5\ntwo real numbers.\nSincetheyworkforanytworealnumbers, itwouldtakeforevertowriteout\nevery possible combination, since there are an inflnite(NOTE: Advanced: we\nreally need to deflne what inflnite means, nicely!) amount of real numbers! To\nmake things easier, it is convenient to use letters to stand in for any number2,\nand then we can flll in a particular number when we need to. For example, the\nfollowing equation\nx+y =z (1.1)\ncan flnd the change you are owed for buying an item. In this equation, x\nrepresentstheamountofchangeyoushouldget,z istheamountyoupayedand\ny is the price of the item. All you need to do is write the amount you payed\ninstead of z and the price instead of y, your change is then x. But to be able to\nflnd your change you will need to rearrange the equation for x. We\u2019ll flnd out\nhow to do that just after we learn some more details about the basic operators.\n1.1.1 Adding and Subtracting\nAdding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing are the most basic operations\nbetween numbers but they are very closely related to each other. You can\nthink of subtracting asbeing the opposite of adding since adding a number and\nthen subtracting the same number will not change what you started with. For\nexample, if we start with a and add b, then subtract b, we will just get back to\na again\na+b b=a (1.2)\n\u00a1\n5+2 2=5\n\u00a1\n(NOTE:reworkthesebitsintotheNegativeNumberssection. itneedsmore\nattentionthanweinitiallythought.) Subtractionisactuallythesameasadding\na negative number. A negative number is a number less than zero. Numbers\ngreater than zero are called positive numbers. In this example, a and b are\npositive numbers, but b is a negative number\n\u00a1\na b=a+( b) (1.3)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n5 3=5+( 3)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n1ArithmeticistheGreekwordfor\\number\"\n2Wewilllookatthisinmoredetailinchapter3.\n4 It doesn\u2019t matter which order you write additions and subtractions(NOTE:\nAdvanced: Thisisapropertyknownasassociativity,whichmeansa+b=b+a),\nbut it looks better to write subtractions to the right. You will agree that a b\n\u00a1\nlooks neater than b+a, and it makes some sums easier, for example, most\n\u00a1\npeople flnd 12 3 a lot easier to work out than 3+12, even though they are\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nthe same thing.\n1.1.2 Negative Numbers\nNegative numbers can be very confusing to begin with, but there is nothing\nto be afraid of. When you are adding a negative number, it is the same as\nsubtractingthatnumberifitwerepositive. Likewise, ifyousubtractanegative\nnumber, it is the same as adding the number if it were positive. Numbers are\neither positive or negative, and we call this their sign. A positive number has\npositive sign, and a negative number has a negative sign.\n(NOTE: number line here. subtraction is moving to left, adding is moving\nto the right. maybe something else about negative numbers?)\nTable 1.1 shows how to calculate the sign of the answer when you multiply\ntwo numbers together. The flrst column shows the sign of one of the numbers,\nthe second column gives the sign of the other number, and the third column\nshows what sign the answer will be. So multiplying a negative number by\na b a b\n\u00a3\n+ + +\n+ - -\n- + -\n- - +\nTable 1.1: Table of signs for multiplying two numbers.\na positive number always gives you a negative number, whereas multiplying\nnumberswhichhavethesamesignalwaysgivesapositivenumber. Forexample,\n2 3=6 and 2 3=6, but 2 3= 6 and 2 3= 6.\n\u00a3 \u00a1 \u00a3\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a3 \u00a1 \u00a3\u00a1 \u00a1\nAdding numbers works slightly difierently, have a look at Table 1.2. If you\na b a+b\n+ + +\n+ - ?\n- + ?\n- - -\nTable 1.2: Table of signs for adding two numbers.\nadd two positive numbers you will always get a positive number, but if you add\ntwo negative numbers you will always get a negative number. If the numbers\nhave difierent sign, then the sign of the answer depends on which one is bigger.\n5 1.1.3 Brackets\nIn equation (1.3) we used brackets3 around b. Brackets are used to show the\n\u00a1\norder in which you must do things. This is important as you can get difierent\nanswers depending on the order in which you do things. For example\n(5 10)+20=70 (1.4)\n\u00a3\nwhereas\n5 (10+20)=150 (1.5)\n\u00a3\nIf you don\u2019t see any brackets, you should always do multiplications and divi-\nsions flrst and then additions and subtractions4. You can always put your own\nbrackets into equations using this rule to make things easier for yourself, for\nexample:\na b+c d = (a b)+(c d) (1.6)\n\u00a3 \u00a5 \u00a3 \u00a5\n5 10+20 4 = (5 10)+(20 4)\n\u00a3 \u00a5 \u00a3 \u00a5\n1.1.4 Multiplying and Dividing\nJust like addition and subtraction, multiplication and division are opposites of\neach other. Multiplying by a number and then dividing by the same number\ngets us back to the start again:\na b b=a (1.7)\n\u00a3 \u00a5\n5 4 4=5\n\u00a3 \u00a5\nSometimes you will see a multiplication of letters without the symbol,\n\u00a3\ndon\u2019t worry, its exactly the same thing. Mathematicians are lazy and like to\nwrite things in the neatest way possible.\nabc=a b c (1.8)\n\u00a3 \u00a3\nIt is usually neater to write known numbers to the left, and letters to the\nright. So although 4x and x4 are the same thing(NOTE: Advanced: This is\na property known as commutativity, which means ab = ba), it looks better to\nwrite 4x.\nIf you see a multiplication outside a bracket like this\na(b+c) (1.9)\n3(4 3)\n\u00a1\nthen it means you have to multiply each part inside the bracket by the number\noutside\na(b+c) = ab+ac (1.10)\n3(4 3) = 3 4 3 3=12 9=3\n\u00a1 \u00a3 \u00a1 \u00a3 \u00a1\n3Sometimespeoplesay\\parenthesis\"insteadof\\brackets\".\n4Multiplyinganddividingcanbeperformedinanyorderasitdoesn\u2019tmatter.

What you need to do is\nrearrange the equation so only x is on the left.\nYou can add, subtract, multiply or divide both sides of an equation by any\nnumber you want, as long as you always do it to both sides. If you imagine an\nequation is like a set of weighing scales. (NOTE: diagram here.) If you wish to\nkeep the scales balanced, then when you add something to one side, you must\nalso add something of the same weight to the other side.\nSo for our example we could subtract y from both sides\nx+y = z (1.14)\n=x+y y = z y\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nx = z y\n\u00a1\nso now we can flnd the change is the amount payed take away the price. In\nreal life we can do this in our head, the human brain is very smart and can do\narithmetic without even knowing it.\nWhen you subtract a number from both sides of an equation, it looks just\nlike you moved a positive number from one side and it became a negative on\nthe other, which is exactly what happened. Likewise if you move a multiplied\nnumber from one side to the other, it looks like it changed to a divide. This\nis because you really just divided both sides by that number, and a number\ndivided by itself is just 1\na(5+c) = 3a (1.15)\na a(5+c) = 3a a\n\u00a5 \u00a5\n1 (5+c) = 3 1\n\u00a3 \u00a3\n5+c = 3\nc = 3 5= 2\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n7 However you must be careful when doing this, as it is easy to make mistakes.\nThe following is the wrong thing to do5.\n5a+c = 3a (1.16)\n5+c = 3a a\n6 \u00a5\nCan you see why it is wrong? The reason why it is wrong is because we didn\u2019t\ndivide the c part by a as well. The correct thing to do is\n5a+c = 3a (1.17)\n5+c a = 3\n\u00a5\nc a = 3 5= 2\n\u00a5 \u00a1 \u00a1\n1.1.6 Living Without the Number Line\nThe number line in (NOTE: ref when we do it) is a good way to visualise what\nnegative numbers are, but it can get wery ine\u2013cient to use it every time you\nwant to addorsubtract negative numbers. To keep things simple, we will write\ndown three rules that you should memorise. These rules will let you work out\nwhat the answer is when you add or subtract numbers which may be negative\nand will also help you keep your work tidy and easier to understand.\nSigns Rule 1\nIfyouhaveanequationwhichhasanegativenumberontheveryfarleft, itcan\nbe confusing. But it doesn\u2019t matter where we put the negative number, as long\nas it is on the left of the equals sign(NOTE: this is confusing). If we move it\nmoretotheright,itmakesmoresenseasitjustlookslikesubtractingapositive\nnumber.\na+b = b a (1.18)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n5+10 = 10 5=5\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nThismakesequationseasiertounderstand. Forexample,aquestionlike\\What\nis 7+11?\" looksalotmorecomplicated than\\Whatis11 7?\", eventhough\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nthey are exactly the same question.\nSigns Rule 2\nWhen you have two negative numbers like 3 7, you can calculate the an-\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nswer by simply adding together the numbers as if they were positive and then\nremembering to put a negative sign in front.\nc d = (c+d) (1.19)\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n7 2 = (7+2)= 9\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n5The6=symbolsaysthatthisisincorrectasitmeans\\notequalto\".\n8 Signs Rule 3\nIn section 1.1.2 we seen that the sign of two numbers added together depends\non which one is bigger. This last rule tells us that all we need to do is take the\nsmaller number away from the larger one, and remember to put a negative sign\nbefore the answer if the bigger number was subtracted to begin with. In this\nequation, F is bigger than e.\ne F = (F e) (1.20)\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n2 11 = (11 2)= 9\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nYou can even combine these rules together, so for example you can use rule\n1 on 10+3 to get 3 10, and then use rule 3 to get (10 3)= 7.\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nNowyouknoweverythingthereistoknowaboutarithmetic. Sotryoutyour\nskills on the exercises at the end of this chapter and ask your teacher for more\nquestions just like them. You can also try making up your own questions, solve\nthem and try them out on your classmates to see if you get the same answers.\nPractice is the only way to get good at maths.\n1.2 Types of Real Numbers\n(NOTE:maybemoreintrohere,breakupthechapterintroandputsomehere?)\n1.2.1 Integers\nThe natural numbers are all the numbers which you can use for counting\n0;1;2;3;4::: (1.21)\nThese are the flrst numbers learnt by children, and the easiest to understand.\nMathematicians use the symbol N to mean the set of all natural numbers. The\nnatural numbers are a subset of the real numbers since every natural number is\nalso a real number.\nThe integers are all of the natural numbers and their negatives\n::: 4; 3; 2; 1;0;1;2;3;4::: (1.22)\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nMathematicians use the symbol Z to mean the set of all integers. The integers\nare a subset of the real numbers, since every integer is a real number.\n(NOTE: possible analogy... whole fruit on a tree, if you eat some, its not an\ninteger anymore.)\n1.2.2 Fractions and Decimal numbers\nA fraction is any kind of number divided by another number. There are several\nways to write a number divided by another one, such as a b, a=b and a. The\n\u00a5 b\nflrst way of writing a fraction is very hard to work with, so we will use only the\nother two. We call the number on the top, the numerator and the number on\nthe bottom the denominator. e.g.\n1 numerator=1\n(1.23)\n5 denominator=5\n9 The reciprocal of a fraction is the fraction turned upside down, in other\nwords the numerator becomes the denominator and the denominator becomes\nthenumerator.

Every real number can be written as a\ndecimal. Forexamplethenumber3+14=100canbewrittenmuchmorecleanly\nas 3;14.\nAll real numbers can be written as a decimal. However, some numbers\nwouldtakeahugeamountofpaper(andink)towriteoutinfull! Somedecimal\nnumbers will have a number which will repeat itself, such as 0;33333::: where\nthere are an inflnite number of 3\u2019s. We can write this decimal value by using a\ndotabovetherepeatingnumber,so0;3_ =0;33333:::. Iftherearetworepeating\nnumbers such as 0;121212::: then you can place dots6 on each of the repeated\nnumbers 0;1_2_ = 0;121212:::. These kinds of repeating decimals are called\nrecurring decimals.\n(NOTE: should we have a table of, say, the 10 most common fractions?)\n1.2.3 Rational Numbers\nThe syllabus requires:\nidentify rational numbers\n\u2020\nconvert between terminating or recurring decimals and their fractional\n\u2020\nform\nA rational number is any number which can be written as a fraction with\nan integer on the top and an integer on the bottom (as long as the integer\non the bottom is not zero) (NOTE: Advanced: This can be expressed in the\nform a;a;b Z;b = 0 which means \\the set of numbers a when a and b are\nb 2 6 b\nintegers\".).\nMathematicians use the symbol Q to mean the set of all rational numbers.\nThe set of rational numbers contains all numbers which can be written as ter-\nminating or repeating decimals. (NOTE: Advanced: All integers are rational\nnumbers with denominator 1.)\nAn irrational number is any real number that is not a rational number.\nWhen expressed as decimals these numbers can never be fully written out as\nthey have an inflnite number of decimal places which never fall into a repeating\npattern, for example p2 = 1;41421356:::, \u2026 = 3;14159265:::. \u2026 is a Greek\nletterandispronouncedjustlike\\pie\". We\u2019llmentionmoreabout\u2026 inchapter\n7.1.\nYou can add and multiply rational numbers and still get a rational number\nat the end, which is very useful.

The lowest common denominator of 3 and 4\nis the number that has both 3 and 4 as factors, which is 12.\n7Somepeoplesaydivisor insteadoffactor.\n11 For example, if we wish to add 3 + 2, we flrst need to write both fractions\n4 3\nso that their denominators are the same by flnding the lowest common denom-\ninator, which we know is 12. We can do this by multiplying 3 by 38 and 2 by\n4 3 3\n4\n4\n3 2 3 3 2 4\n+ = + (1.27)\n4 3 4 \u00a3 3 3 \u00a3 4\n3 3 2 4\n= \u00a3 + \u00a3\n4 3 3 4\n\u00a3 \u00a3\n9 8\n= +\n12 12\n9+8\n=\n12\n17\n=\n12\nDividing by a rational number is the same as multiplying by it\u2019s reciprocal,\nas long as neither the numerator nor the denominator is zero:\na c a d ad\n= : = (1.28)\nb \u00a5 d b c bc\nA rational number may also be written as a proper fraction, which is the\nsum of an integer and a rational fraction.\nb Ac+b b\nA = =A+ (1.29)\nc c c\nThis notation has the advantage that you can readily tell the approximate size\nof the fraction, but has the disadvantage that Ab can be mistaken for A b\nc \u00a3 c\ninstead of A+ b. However, it can be used to help convert rational numbers\nc\ninto decimals and vica-versa. A fraction is called an improper fraction if the\nnumerator is bigger than the denominator, meaning that it could be written as\na proper fraction.\nConverting Decimals into Rational Numbers\nIf you recall from section 1.2.2 that a decimal number has an integer and a\nfractionalpart,thenyouwillnoticehowsimilardecimalsaretoproperfractions.\nThe integer part of a decimal is also the integer part of a proper fraction and\neach digit after the decimal point is a fraction with denominator in increasing\npowersoften,inotherwords 1 is0;1, 1 is0;01andsoon. Forexample,2;103\n10 100\nis 2+ 1 + 0 + 3 which is 2 103 (you could also have just written 2103).\n10 100 1000 1000 1000\nWhen the decimal is a recurring decimal, a certain amount of algebraic\nmanipulation is involved in flnding the fractional part. Lets have a look at an\nexample to see how this is done. If we wish to write 0;3_ in the form a (where a\nb\n83\nisreallyjustacomplicatedwayofwriting1. Multiplyinganumberby1doesn\u2019tchange\n3\nthenumber.\n12 and b are integers) then we would proceed as follows\nx = 0;33333::: (1.30)\n10x = 3;33333::: multiply by 10 on both sides (1.31)\n9x = 3 subtracting (1.30) from (1.31)\n3 1\nx = =\n9 3\nAnd another example would be to write 5;432 as a rational fraction\nx = 5;432432432::: (1.32)\n1000x = 5432;432432432::: (1.33)\n999x = 5427 subtracting (1.32) from (1.33)\n5427 201\nx = =\n999 37\nBut not all decimal numbers are rational numbers as can be seen in flgure\n1.1. When possible, you should always use fractions instead of decimals.\nConverting Rationals into Decimal Numbers\nIfyouuseacalculator,youcansimplydividethenumeratorbythedenominator.\nIf there is no calculator at hand, long division will su\u2013ce. (NOTE: i did long\ndivision in primary school... i don\u2019t think it warrants its own intro, so i guess\nwe can assume they know it already. anyone disagree?) For example, we may\nconvert 1 to decimal form by doing the following long division\n4\n0,25\n4 1,00 (1.34)\n\u00a2 8\n20\n20\nAs another example, we can convert 67 to decimal form (with 4 signiflcant\n153\ndigits (NOTE: dependency problem... we mention SFs later than this. should\nwe place this after \\accuracy\" or reword/remove this?)).\n0,4379\n153 67,0000 (1.35)\n\u00a2612\n580\n459\n1210\n1071\n1390\n1377\n13\n.\n.\n.\n(NOTE: note that this is much easier if the denominator is a multiple of 10)\n13 1.3 Exponents\nThe syllabus requires:\nsimplify expressions using the laws of exponents for rational\n\u2020\nindices\nExponential notation is a short way of writing the same number multiplied by\nitself many times. For example, instead of 5 5 5, we write 53 to show that\n\u00a3 \u00a3\nthe number 5 is multiplied by itself 3 times, we say it as \\5 to the power of 3\".\nLikewise 52 is 5 5 and 35 is 3 3 3 3 3.\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\nWewillnowhaveacloserlookatwritingnumbersasexponentials(an)when\nn is an integer and a can be any real number9.\nThe nth power of a is\nan =1 a a ::: a (n times) (1.36)\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\nwith a appearing n times. a is called the base and n is called the exponent. 1 is\nhere so that it can be seen that any number to the power of zero, is 1. We can\nalso deflne what it means if n is a negative integer\n\u00a1\na n =1 a a ::: a (n times) (1.37)\n\u00a1\n\u00a5 \u00a5 \u00a5 \u00a5\nIf n is an even integer, then an will always be positive for any non-zero real\nnumber a. For example, although 2 is negative, ( 2)2 = 1 2 2 = 4\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a3\u00a1 \u00a3\u00a1\nis positive and so is ( 2) 2 = 1 2 2 = 1. You should now notice\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a5 \u00a1 \u00a5 \u00a1 4\nthat a n = 1=an, which is one of many rules we often use when working with\n\u00a1\nexponentials.\nThereareseveralruleswecanusetomanipulateexponentialnumbers,mak-\ning them much easier to work with. We will list all the rules here for easy\nreference, but we will explain each rule in more detail (NOTE: maybe try to\nreduce the number here. kids memorise rules and 7 is maybe too much.)\naman = am+n (1.38)\n1\na n = (1.39)\n\u00a1\nan\nam\n= am n (1.40)\n\u00a1\nan\n(ab)n = anbn (1.41)\n(am)n = amn (1.42)\na n an\n= (1.43)\nb bn\n\u2021 \u00b7\nam n = pnam (1.44)\nExponential Rule 1: aman =am+n\nOur deflnition of exponential notation shows that\naman = 1 a ::: a (m times) (1.45)\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\n1 a ::: a (n times)\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\n= 1 a ::: a (m+n times)\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\n= am+n\n9wecanwritethisasn2Z,a2R\n14 This simple rule is the reason why exponentials were originally invented. In\nthe days before calculators, all multiplication had to be done by hand with a\npencil and a pad of paper. Multiplication takes a very long time to do and\nis very tedious. Adding numbers however, is very easy and quick to do. If\nyou look at what this rule is saying you will realise that it means that adding\nthe exponents of two exponential numbers (of the same base) is the same as\nmultiplying the two numbers together. This meant that for certain numbers,\nthere was no need to actually multiply the numbers together in order to flnd\nout what their multiple was. This saved mathematicians a lot of time, which\nthey could use to do something more productive.\nExponential Rule 2: a n = 1\n\u00a1 an\nOur deflnition of exponential notation for a negative exponent shows that\na n = 1 a ::: a (n times) (1.46)\n\u00a1\n\u00a5 \u00a5 \u00a5\n1\n= (n times)\n1 a a\n\u00a3 \u00a3\u00a2\u00a2\u00a2\u00a3\n1\n=\nan\nThis means that a minus sign in the exponent is just another way of writing\nthat the whole exponential number is to be divided instead of multiplied.\nam\nExponential Rule 3: =am n\nan \u00a1\nWe already realised with rule 2 that a minus sign is another way of saying that\nthe exponential number is to be divided instead of multiplied. Rule 3 is just\na more general way of saying the same thing. We can get this rule by just\nmultiplying rule 2 by am on both sides and using rule 1.\nam\n= ama n (1.47)\n\u00a1\nan\n= am n\n\u00a1\nExponential Rule 4: (ab)n =anbn\nWhenrealnumbersaremultipliedtogether, itdoesn\u2019tmatterinwhatorderthe\nmultiplication occurs(NOTE: Advanced: This is a collection of two properties,\ncalled commutativity (meaning ab = ba) and associativity (meaning a(bc) =\n(ab)c).). Therefore\n(ab)n = a b a b ::: a b (n times) (1.48)\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\n= a a ::: a (n times)\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\nb b ::: b (n times)\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\n= anbn\n15 Exponential Rule 5: (am)n =amn\nWe can flnd the exponential of an exponential just as well as we can for a\nnumber. After all, an exponential number is a real number.\n(am)n = am am ::: am (n times) (1.49)\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\n= a a ::: a (m n times)\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\n= amn\nExponential Rule 6: a n = an\nb bn\n\u00a1 \u00a2\nFractionscanbemultipliedtogetherbyseparatelymultiplyingtheirnumerators\nand denominators (remember equation (1.26)). This means\na n a a a\n= ::: (n times) (1.50)\n\u2021b \u00b7 b \u00a3 b \u00a3 \u00a3 b\na a ::: a\n= \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 (n times)\nb b ::: b\nan\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\n=\nbn\nExponential Rule 7: am n = pnam\nWe say that x is an nth root of b if xn =b. For example, ( 1)4 =1, so 1 is a\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n4th root of 1. Using rule 5, we notice that\n(am n)n =am nn =am (1.51)\ntherefore am n must be an nth root of am. We can therefore say\nam n = pnam (1.52)\nwhere pnam is the nth root of am (if it exists).\nA number may not always have a real nth root. For example, if n = 2 and\na = 1, then there is no real number such that x2 = 1 because x2 can never\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nbe a negative number(NOTE: Advanced: There are numbers which can solve\nproblems like x2 = 1, but they are beyond the scope of this book. They are\n\u00a1\ncalled complex numbers.). It is also possible for more than one nth root of a\nnumber to exist. For example, ( 2)2 = 4 and 22 = 4, so both -2 and 2 are\n\u00a1\n2nd (square) roots of 4. Usually if there is more than one root, we choose the\npositive real solution and move on.\n1.4 Surds\nThe syllabus requires:\nidentify between which 2 integers any simple surd lies\n\u2020\nadd, subtract, multiply and divide simple surds\n\u2020\nWe have already discussed what is meant by the nth root of a number. If such\nan nth root is irrational, we call it a surd. For example, p2 and p36 are surds,\n16 but p4 = 2 is not a surd, because 2 is a rational number. We will only look\nat surds of the form pna where a is a positive number. When n=2 we do not\nwrite it in and just leave the surd as pa, which is much easier to read.\nThere are several rules for manipulating surds. We will list them all and\nthen explain where each rule comes from in more detail.\npnapnb = pnab (1.53)\na pna\nn = (1.54)\nrb pnb\npnam = am n (1.55)\nSurd Rule 1: pnapnb= pnab\nIt is often enlightening to look at a surd in exponential notation as it allows\nus to use the rules we learnt in section 1.3. If we write pnapnb in exponential\nnotation we can see how rule 1 appears\npnapnb = an1 bn1 (1.56)\n1\n= (ab)n\n= pnab\nSurd Rule 2: n a = pna\nb pn b\np\nRule 2 appears by looking at n a in exponential notation and applying the\nb\nexponential rules p\na a n1\nn = (1.57)\nrb b\n\u2021 \u00b7\nan1\n=\nbn1\npna\n=\npnb\nSurd Rule 3: pnam =am n\nRule 3 appears by looking at pnam in exponential notation and applying the\nexponential rules\npnam = (am)n1 (1.58)\nm\n= an\n1.4.1 Like and Unlike Surds\nTwo surds mpa and pnb are called like surds if m=n, otherwise they are called\nunlike surds. For example p2 and p3 are like surds, however p2 and p32 are\nunlike surds. An important thing to realise about the rules we have just learnt\nis that the surds in the rules are all like surds.\n17 If we wish to use the surd rules on unlike surds, then we must flrst convert\nthem into like surds. In order to do this we use the formula\npnam = bpn abm (1.59)\nto rewrite the unlike surds so that bn is the same for all the surds.\n1.4.2 Rationalising Denominators\nIt is useful to work with fractions which have rational denominators instead of\nsurd denominators. It is possible to rewrite any fraction which has a surd in\nthe denominator as a fraction which has a rational denominator. We will now\nsee how this can be achieved.\nAny expression of the form pa+pb (where a and b are rational) can be\nchanged into a rational number by multiplying by pa pb (similarly pa pb\n\u00a1 \u00a1\ncan be rationalised by multiplying by pa+pb). This is because\n(pa+pb)(pa pb)=a b (1.60)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nwhich is rational (since a and b are rational).\nIfwehaveafractionwhichhasadenominatorwhichlookslikepa+pb,then\nwe can simply multiply both top and bottom by pa pb achieving a rational\n\u00a1\ndenominator.\nc pa pb c\n= \u00a1 (1.61)\npa+pb pa pb \u00a3 pa+pb\n\u00a1\ncpa cpb\n= \u00a1\na b\n\u00a1\nor similarly\nc pa+pb c\n= (1.62)\npa pb pa+pb \u00a3 pa pb\n\u00a1 \u00a1\ncpa+cpb\n=\na b\n\u00a1\n1.4.3 Estimating a Surd\n(NOTE: has anyone got a better way to do this?) It is sometimes useful to\nknow the approximate value of a surd without having to use a calculator. This\ninvolves knowing some roots which have integer solutions.\nForasurd pna, flndanintegersmallerthanawithanintegerasitsnthroot\nandthenflndthenexthighestinteger(whichshouldalsobelargerthana)with\nan integer nth root. The surd which you are trying to estimate will be between\nthose two integers. (NOTE: this paragraph sucks, rewrite it so that it can be\nunderstood.)\nFor example, when given the surd p352 you should be able to tell that it lies\nsomewhere between 3 and 4, because p327=3 and p364=4 and 52 is between\n27 and 64. In fact p352=3:73::: which is indeed between 3 and 4.\n18 The easiest arithmetic procedure10 to flnd the square root of any number\nN is to choose a number x that is close to the square root, flnd N and then\nx\nx+N\nuse x = x for the next choice of x. x converges rapidly towards the actual\n0 2\nvalue of the square root - the number of signiflcant digits doubles each time.\n(NOTE:arithmetic? procedure? converges? rapidly? thislanguageisnotbasic\nenough!)\nWe will now use this method to flnd p55. We know that 72 =49, therefore\nthe square root of 55 must be close to 7.\nLet x = 7 (1.63)\n55\nthen, = 7;8571::: (1.64)\n7\n7+7;8571:::\n)x = = 7;4285::: (1.65)\n0\n2\n55\n= 7;4038::: (1.66)\n7:4285:::\n7;4285:::+7;4038:::\n)x = =7;4162::: (1.67)\n0\n2\nUsing a calculator we flnd that p55 = 7;416198:::, which is very close to our\napproximation.\n1.5 Accuracy\nThe syllabus requires:\nwrite irrational (and rational) solutions rounded to a specified\n\u2020\ndegree of accuracy\nknow when to approximate an irrational by a terminating rational,\n\u2020\nand when not to\nexpress large and small numbers in scientific or engineering notation\n\u2020\nWealreadymentionedinsection1.2.2thatcertainnumbersmaytakeaninflnite\namount of paper and ink to write out. Not only is that impossible, but writing\nnumbers out to a high accuracy (too many decimal places) is very inconvenient\nand rarely gives better answers. For this reason we often estimate the number\ntoacertainnumberofdecimalplacesortoagivennumberofsigniflcant flgures,\nwhich is even better.\n(NOTE: the notes on rounding need to be better. this is not very good.)\nApproximating a decimal number to a given number of decimal places is the\nquickest way to approximate a number. Just count along the number of places\nyou have been asked to approximate the number to and then forget all the\nnumbers after that point. You round up the flnal digit if the number you cut\nofi was greater or equal to 5 and round down (leave the digit alone) otherwise.\nFor example, approximating 2;6525272 to 3 decimal places is 2;653 because the\nflnal digit is rounded up.\n10This procedure is known as Heron\u2019s Method, which was used by the Babylonians over\n4000yearsago.\n19 (NOTE: more on the difierence between DP and SF needed) In a number,\neach non-zero digit is a signiflcant flgure. Zeroes are only counted if they are\nbetweentwonon-zerodigitsorareattheendofthedecimalpart. Forexample,\nthe number 2000 has 1 signiflcant flgure, but 2000;0 has 5 signiflcant flgures.\nEstimating a number works by removing signiflcant flgures from your number\n(startingfromtheright)untilyouhavethedesirednumberofsigniflcantflgures,\nrounding as you go. For example 6;827 has 4 signiflcant flgures, but if you wish\nto write it to 3 signiflcant flgures it would mean removing the 7 and rounding\nup, so it would be 6;83.\nIt is important to know when to estimate a number and when not to. It is\nusually good practise to only estimate numbers when it is absolutely necessary,\nand to instead use symbols to represent certain irrational numbers (such as \u2026);\napproximating them only at the very end of a calculation. If it is necessary\nto approximate a number in the middle of a calculation, then it is often good\nenough to approximate to a few decimal places.\n1.5.1 Scientiflc Notation\nInscienceoneoftenneedstoworkwithverylargeorverysmallnumbers. These\ncan be written more easily in scientiflc notation, which has the general form\na 10m (1.68)\n\u00a3\nwhere a is a decimal number between 1 and 10. The m is an integer and if\nit is positive it represents how many zeros should appear to the right of a. If\nm is negative then it represents how many times the decimal place in a should\nbe moved to the left. For example 3;2 103 represents 32000 and 3;2 10 3\n\u00a1\n\u00a3 \u00a3\nrepresents 0;0032.\nIf a number must be converted into scientiflc notation, we need to work out\nhow many times the number must be multiplied or divided by 10 to make it\ninto a number between 1 and 10 (i.e. we need to work out the value of the\nexponent m) and what this number is (the value of a). We do this by counting\nthenumberofdecimalplacesthedecimalpointmustmove. Itisusuallyenough\nto estimate a to only a few decimal places.\n1.5.2 Worked Examples\nWorked Example 1 : Manipulating Rational Numbers\nQuestion:\nSimplify the following expressions\na) 7 + 5 b) 11 20 c) 73 73\n8 2 27 \u00a3 3 69 \u00a5 69\nAnswer:\na)\nStep 1 : Rule of addition\nWrite out the rule of addition for rational numbers (1.25)\na c ad+bc\n+ =\nb d bd\n20 Step 2 : Fill in the values\nFill in the values for a;b;c and d.

Likewise if you are shown a\nsequence of numbers, you may not be able to work out what pattern relates\nthem. That might be because there is no pattern, or it might just be that you\ncan\u2019t see it straight away.\nWe will be thinking about sequences in this chapter and it is useful to be\nable to talk in general about them. We will want to talk about the numbers\nin the sequence, so rather than having to say something longwinded like \\the\nsecond term in the sequence is related to the flrst term by this rule....\", we give\neach term in the sequence a name.

A quadratic sequence is a se-\nquence in which the difierences between each consecutive term difier by the\nsame amount, called a constant second difierence. In the example sequences\nin the introduction, equation (2.2) is a quadratic sequence because the difier-\nence between each term difiers by one each time. We can look at the difierence\nbetween each term and see that the difierences form a linear sequence:\na a =2 1 =1\n2 1\n\u00a1 \u00a1\na 3 a =4 2 =2\n2\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\na a =7 4 =3\n4 3\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nHere you can see clearly that the difierence between each difierence is 1. We\ncall this the constant second difierence and in this case is = 1. The general\nform of this example of a quadratic sequence (a sequence with constant second\ndifierence) is\n1 1\na = (n2 1) (n 1)+1 (2.7)\nn\n2 \u00a1 \u00a1 2 \u00a1\nForageneralquadraticsequencewithconstantseconddifierenceD theformula\nfor a is\nn\nD\na = (n2 1)+d(n 1)+a (2.8)\nn 1\n2 \u00a1 \u00a1\nThe difierence between a and a is Dn+d.\nn n 1\n\u00a1\nCheck for yourself that a a = Dn+d. (Use the formula for a and\nn n 1 n\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nthen again for a (setting n=n 1 in the formula) and then work out what\nn 1\n\u00a1 \u00a1\na a is.) Make up your own quadratic sequences with a constant second\nn n 1\n\u00a1 \u00a1\ndifierence not equal to 1.\n25 Figure 2.2: Tree diagram of series\n2.1.3 Geometric Sequences\nDeflnition: Ageometricsequenceisasequenceinwhicheverynum-\nberinthesequenceisequaltothepreviousnumberinthesequence,\nmultiplied by another constant number.\nThis means that the ratio between consecutive numbers in the sequence is a\nconstant. We will explain what we mean by ratio after looking at this example.\nWhatisin(cid:176)uenza((cid:176)u)? In(cid:176)uenza,commonlycalled\u2019the(cid:176)u\u2019,iscausedbythe\nin(cid:176)uenza virus, which infects the respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs).

It is good practise to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze to\nnot infect others around you when you have the (cid:176)u.\nLetsassumeyouhavethe(cid:176)uvirusandyouforgottocoveryourmouthwhen\ntwo friends came to visit while you were sick in bed.

Lets assume\nthis pattern continues and each person infected, infects 2 other friends. We can\nrepresent these events in the following manner:\n(NOTE: Insert pictures here.)\nAgain we can tabulate the events and formulate an equation for the general\ncase:\n# day (n) # Carrier # Recipients/Carrier Formula\n1 You spread virus 2 2=2\n2 2 4 4=2 x 2 = 2 x 21\n3 4 8 8=2 x 4=2 x 2x2=2 x 22\n4 8 16 16=2 x 8=2 x 2x2x2=2 x 23\n5 16 32 32=2 x 16=2 x 2x2x2x2=2 x 24\n. . . .\n. . . .\n. . . .\nn ... ... = 2 x 2x2x2x...x2=2 x 2n 1\n\u00a1\nYou sneeze and the virus is carried over to 2 people who start the chain\n(a = 2).

We can rearrange this to a = a +d. This is an expression\nn n 1\n\u00a1\nfor a in terms of a , which is called a recursive equation. So the recursive\nn n 1\n\u00a1\nequation for a linear sequence of constant difierence d is\na a =d (2.12)\nn n 1\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n27 We can do the same thing for quadratic sequences. There we noticed that\na a =Dn+d. Thentherecursiveequationforaquadraticsequencewith\nn n 1\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nconstant second derivative D is\na a =Dn+d (2.13)\nn n 1\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n(NOTE: Here we haven\u2019t said explicitly what d is or how to work it out. This\nbothers me. I think to be honest that you need more information. like maybe\na a wouldn\u2019t include d.)\nn n 2\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nIt is not always possible to flnd a recursive equation for a sequence, even\nwhen you know the general way to write down any term a .

If we only\nsum a flnite amount of terms, we get a flnite series. We use the symbol S to\nn\nmean the sum of the flrst n terms of a sequence. For example, the sequence of\nnumbers 3;1;4;1;5;9;2;::: has a flnite series S which is simply the flrst 4 terms\n4\nadded together, 3+1+4+1=9.\nIf we sum inflnitely many terms of a sequence, we get an inflnite series.\nA sum may be written out using the summation symbol (Sigma).

We notice that the largest number may be added to\nthe smallest, then the second largest added to second smallest, giving the same\nnumber. If we keep doing this we flnd that all the numbers may be paired up\ntogether like this until we reach the middle and there are no more numbers left\nto pair ofi\nn\na +a +:::+a =(a +a )+(a +a )+::: times (2.23)\n1 2 n 1 n 2 n 1\n\u00a1 2\nIf there are an odd number of numbers, then we must not forget to add the\nunpaired number to the answer at the end.

The term on the right is a sum of a d, which is a constant, so we may\n1\n\u00a1\nrPewrite that term as\nn n\na d = (a d) 1 (2.28)\n1 1\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nXi=1 Xi=1\n= (a d)n\n1\n\u00a1\nHere we used equation (2.20) to arrive at the solution. The term on the left of\nequation (2.27) is also quite simple. Firstly we can take the constant d out of\nthe sum\nn n\ndi=d i (2.29)\nXi=1 Xi=1\nand then we can use equation (2.25) to flnd\nn\ndn\nd i= (n+1) (2.30)\n2\nXi=1\nAdding together the solutions to the left and right terms (equations (2.28) and\n(2.30)) we get the general form of a flnite arithmetic series\nn\nn\nd(i 1)+a = (2a +d(n 1)) (2.31)\n1 1\n\u00a1 2 \u00a1\nXi=1\nFor example, if we wish to know the series S for the arithmetic sequence\n20\na =7(i 1)+3,wecouldeithercalculateeachtermindividuallyandsumthem\ni\n\u00a1\n20\n7(i 1)+3 = 3+10+17+24+31+38+45+52\n\u00a1\nXi=1\n+59+66+73+80+87+94+101\n+108+115+122+129+136\n= 1390 (2.32)\nor more sensibly, we could use equation (2.31) noting that d = 7, a = 3 and\n1\nn=20 so that\n20\n20\n7(i 1)+3 = (2 3+7 19) (2.33)\n\u00a1 2 \u00a3 \u00a3\nXi=1\n= 1390\nIn this example, it is clear that using (2.31) is beneflcial.\n31 2.2.2 Finite Squared Series\nWhen we sum a flnite number of terms in a quadratic sequence, we get a flnite\nquadratic series. The general form of a quadratic series is quite complicated, so\nwe will only look at the simple case when D =1 and d=a =0 in the general\n0\nform (??). This is the sequence of squares of the integers\na = i2 (2.34)\ni\n= 12;22;32;42;52;62;:::\n= 1;4;9;16;25;36:::\nIf we wish to sum this sequence and create a series, then we write\nn\nS = i2 =1+4+9+:::+n2 (2.35)\nn\nXi=1\nwhich can be written in general as (NOTE: the syllabus requires that we prove\nthisresult! anyideas,withoutconfusingthehelloutofa16yearold? ithought\neven the other ones were a bit too hard for this level, to be honest.)\nn\nn(2n+1)(n+1)\ni2 = (2.36)\n6\nXi=1\n2.2.3 Finite Geometric Series\nWhen we sum a flnite number of terms in a geometric sequence, we get a flnite\ngeometric series. We know from (??) that we can write out each term of a\ngeometric sequence in a general form. By simply adding together the flrst n\nterms in the general form we are actually writing out the series\nS =a +a r+a r2+:::+a rn 1 (2.37)\nn 1 1 1 1 \u00a1\nWe may multiply this by r on both sides, giving us\nrS =a r+a r2+a r3+:::+a rn (2.38)\nn 1 1 1 1\nYou may notice that all the terms are the same in (2.37) and (2.38), except the\nflrst and last. If we subtract (2.37) from (2.38) we are left with just\nrS S =a +a rn (2.39)\nn n 1 1\n\u00a1\nS (r 1)=a (1+rn)\nn 1\n\u00a1\ndividing by (r 1) on both sides, we have the general form of a geometric\nsequence since S\u00a1 = n a:ri 1\nn i=1 \u00a1\nP\nn a(rn 1)\na:ri \u00a11 = \u00a1 (2.40)\nr 1\nXi=1 \u00a1\n32 2.2.4 Inflnite Series\nThus far we have been working only with flnite sums, meaning that whenever\nwe determined the sum of a series, we only considered the sum of the flrst n\nterms. It is the subject of this section to consider what happens when we add\ninflnitely many terms together. You might think that this is a silly question\n- surely one will get to inflnity when one sums inflnitely many numbers, no\nmatter how small they are? The surprising answer is that in some cases one\nwill reach inflnity (like when you try to add all the integers together), but in\nsome cases one will get a flnite answer. If you don\u2019t believe this, try doing the\nfollowing sum on your calculator or computer: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +::: . You\n2 4 8 16 32\nmight think that if you keep adding more and more terms you will eventually\ngetlargerandlargernumbers, butinfactyouwon\u2019tevengetpast1-tryitand\nsee for yourself!\nThere is a special sigma notation for inflnite series: we write 1 i to\ni=1\nindicate the inflnite sum 1+2+3+4+::::. When we sum the tePrms of a\nseries, and the answer we get after each summation gets closer and closer to\nsome number, we say that the series converges. If a series does not converge,\nwe say that it diverges.\nThere is a rule for knowing instantly which geometric series converge and\nwhich diverge. When r, the common ratio, is strictly between -1 and 1, i.e.\n1 < r < 1, the inflnite series will converge, otherwise it will diverge. There\n\u00a1\nis also a formula for working out what the series converges to. The sum of an\ninflnite series, symbolised by S , is given by the formula\n1\nS = 1 a :ri 1 = a 1 1<r <1 (2.41)\n1 \u00a1\n1 Xi=1 1 \u00a1r \u00a1\nwhere a is the flrst term of the series, and r is the common ratio. (NOTE:\n1\nthe syllabus requires us to PROVE this series! how can we do that without\na notion of a limit? again the syllabus talks nonsense.) We can see how this\ncomesaboutbylookingat(2.40),as 1<r <1andn= . Wecanignorethe\n\u00a1 1\nrn term since a small number raised to the power of inflnity is inflnitely small.\nTry this yourself by typing in a number between -1 and 1 into your calculator\nand square it, continuing to square the answers thereafter; your calculator will\neventually decide that the answer is zero.\n2.3 Worked Examples\n(NOTE: I think maybe the worked examples should follow the relevant section.\nCheck if the general layout is set.)\n1.

Even ignoring those, though, it would be di\u2013cult to go through\na day without coming into contact with all sorts of functions. We can say\nthat the idea of a function is one of the most basic and powerful ideas in the\nmathematics.\nFunctions everywhere? But who\u2019s ever heard of such a thing? Where does\nthe word even come from? Well, they are everywhere, and, once you begin to\nseethem,functionswillbetheeasiestconceptinmathematics. Wherearethese\nfunctions? Well, the menu in a restaurant is a function. So are the prices in a\nsupermarket. Today\u2019s temperature. Your height, your age, your weight. These\nare all functions.\nA function is just a way of attaching or relating one thing to another. A\nmenu attaches prices to the food in a restaurant, and a supermarket attaches\npricestothethingsitsells. Weneedtonoticeoneveryimportantfact, whichis\nthatthesefunctionscangiveonlyonepricetoeachitem. Wewouldcertainlyget\nangryifarestaurantchargedtwodifierentpricesforthesamedish. However,it\u2019s\nperfectly natural for a restaurant to charge the same price for difierent dishes.\nSimilarly,onepersoncannothavetwodifierentheights,buttwopeoplecanhave\nthe same height.\n3.1.1 Variables, Constants and Relations\nAvariable isalabel whichweallow tochange andbecomeanyelement ofsome\nset of numbers. For example, on a menu in a restaurant \\price\" is a variable on\nthe set of real numbers, since for any menu item the manager can choose any\nprice he or she feels like (with the aim of staying in business). Most often, a\nvariable will be a letter which can take on any value in some set of numbers.\nIn this textbook we will only use real variables, which may take on the value of\nany real number. Though a variable is free to vary, if we wish we can specify\nthat the variable takes on a speciflc value, in which case we say that we assign\na value to the variable. In fact, we do this all the time when working with\nvariables. When we say \\what if we set the price to R50\", we are just assigning\nthe value \\R50\" to the variable \\price\". You have probably already done this\nquite frequently in algebra, when you say \\let x be 1\".\nA constant is a variable which is flxed. We may not know the value of this\nconstant, but this is a number which does not change throughout any problem.\nThe \\speed of light\" is a variable which is always 300 000km per second, i.e.\nit is a constant. Such constant variables occur most frequently in the laws of\nphysics.\nVariables on their own are very abstract, so don\u2019t worry if it is slightly\nconfusing. They become much more understandable when we start to relate\nthem to each other. \\Price\" on a menu may not be a constant, but it must be\ntiedtotheitemsonthatmenu. Foreachitem,wehaveaspecifledprice. Wecan\n39 think of \\item\" as a variable in its own right, and then the menu does nothing\nbut tell us the relationship between the two variables \\item\" and \\price\".\nIngeneral,arelation isanequationwhichrelatestwovariables. Forexample,\ny = 5x and y2+x2 = 5 are relations. In both examples x and y are variables\nand5isaconstant,butforagivenvalueofxthevalueofy willbeverydifierent\nin each relation.\nOur example of a restaurant menu shows that relations between variables\ntakeonvariedrepresentations. Besideswritingthemasformulae,wemostoften\ncome across relations in words, tables and graphs. Instead of writing y = 5x,\nwe could also say \\y is always flve times as big as x\". We could also give the\nfollowing table:\n(NOTE: Working on a Latex-less machine, so table will come later)\n(I put in a table but not sure if it\u2019s ok - Jothi)\nx y =5x\n2 10\n6 30\n8 40\n13 65\n15 75\nSome of you may object that this table isn\u2019t very satisfactory, as the same\ntablecouldrepresentalmostanyrelationbetweenxandy. However,whenusing\ntables we normally cheat and just assume that the obvious relationship in the\ntable is the relationship.\nFinally,welookatgraphs(NOTE:surelythisneedstowaituntillater? sorry\n- structuring major headache here)\n3.1.2 Deflnition of a Function (grade 12)\nA function is a relation for which there is only one value of y corresponding to\nanyvalueofx. Wesometimeswritey =f(x), whichisnotationmeaning\u2019y isa\nfunctionofx\u2019. Thisdeflnitionmakescompletesensewhencomparedtoourreal\nworld examples | each person has only one height, so height is a function of\npeople; on each day, in a speciflc town, there is only one average temperature.\nHowever, some very common mathematical constructions are not functions.\nFor example, consider the relation x2+y2 =4. This relation describes a circle\nof radius 2 centred at the origin, as in flgure 3.1. If we let x = 0, we see that\ny2 =4 and thus either y =2 or y = 2. Since there are two y values which are\n\u00a1\npossible for the same x value, the relation x2+y2 =4 is not a function.\nThere is a simple test to check if a relation is a function, by looking at its\ngraph. This test is called the vertical line test. If it is possible to draw any\nvertical line (a line of constant x) which crosses the relation more than once,\nthen the relation is not a function. If more than one intersection point exists,\nthen the intersections correspond to multiple values of y for a single value of x.\nWe can see this with our previous example of the circle by looking at its\ngraph again in flgure 3.1. We see that we can draw a vertical line, for example\nthe dotted line in the drawing, which cuts the circle more than once. Therefore\nthis is not a function.\n40 2\n(cid:0)\n1\n2 1 1 2\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n1\n\u00a1\n(cid:0)\n2\n\u00a1\nFigure 3.1: Graph of y2+x2 =4\nIn a function y =f(x), y is called the dependent variable, because the value\nof y depends on what you choose as x. We say x is the independent variable,\nsince we can choose x to be any number.\n3.1.3 Domain and Range of a Relation\nThe domain of a relation is the set of all the x values for which there exists at\nleast one y value according to that relation. The range is the set of all the y\nvalues, which can be obtained using at least one x value. If the relation is of\nheight to people, then the domain is all living people, while the range would\nbe about 0:1 to 3 metres | no living person can have a height of 0m, and\nwhile strictly it\u2019s not impossible to be taller than 3 metres, no one alive is.\nAn important aspect of this range is that it does not contain all the numbers\nbetween 0.1 and 3, but only six billion of them (as many as there are people).\nAs another example, suppose x and y are real valued variables, and we have\nthe relation y = 2x. Then for any value of x, there is a value of y, so the\ndomain of this relation is the whole set of real numbers. However, we know\nthat no matter what value of x we choose, 2x can never be less than or equal to\n0. Hence the range of this function is all the real numbers strictly greater than\nzero.\nThese are two ways of writing the domain and range of a function, set no-\ntation and interval notation. (NOTE: the syllabus does not say which notation\nmethod to use. we should flnd out, and only use the one if possible. there is no\nneed to add further confusion. then move the unused notation to Extra.)\nSet Notation\nFirst we introduce the symbols > ; < ; ; . > means \u2019is greater than\u2019 and\n\u2022 \u201a\nmeans \u2019is greater than or equal to\u2019. So if we write x > 5, we say that x is\n\u201a\ngreater than 5 and if we write x y, we mean that x can be greater than or\n\u201a\nequal to y. Similarly, < means \u2019is less than\u2019 and means \u2019is less than or equal\n\u2022\nto\u2019. Instead of saying that x is between 6 and 10, we often write 6 < x < 10.\nThis directly means \u2019six is less than x which in turn is less than ten\u2019.\n41 A set of certain x values has the following form:\nx:conditions, more conditions (3.1)\nf g\nWe read this notation as \\the set of all x values where all the conditions are\nsatisfled\". For example, the set of all positive real numbers can be written as\nx:x R;x>0 whichreadsas\\thesetofallxvalueswherexisarealnumber\nf 2 g\nand is greater than zero\". (NOTE: have we even explained what >;<; ;\n\u2022 \u201a\nmean yet? remember... this book must not assume that anyone has seen this\nstufi before.)\nWe use the same notation (with the letter y instead of x) for the range of\nthe function.\nInterval Notation\n(NOTE: rewrite this subsubsection. flrst describe what the brackets mean, and\nthen introduce the concept of a union. all these concepts are new... so we must\ndescribe everything in detail.)\nHere we write an interval in the form \u2019lower bracket, lower number, comma,\nupper number, upper bracket\u2019. Wecanusetwotypesofbrackets,squareones[;]\nor round ones (;). A square bracket means including the number at the end of\nthe interval whereas a round bracket means excluding the number at the endof\nthe interval. It is important to note that this notation can only be used for all\nrealnumbersinaninterval. Itcannotbeusedtodescribeintegersinaninterval\nor rational numbers in an interval.\nSo if x is a real number greater than 2 and less than or equal to 8, then x is\nany number in the interval\n(2;8] (3.2)\nIt is obvious that 2 is the lower number and 8 the upper number. The round\nbracket means \u2019excluding 2\u2019, since x is greater than 2, and the square bracket\nmeans \u2019including 8\u2019 as x is less than or equal to 8.\nNow we come to the idea of a union, which is used to combine things. The\nsymbol for union is . Here we use it to combine two or more intervals. For\n[\nexample, if x is a real number such that 1<x 3 or 6 x<10, then the set\n\u2022 \u2022\nof all the possible x values is\n(1;3] [6;10) (3.3)\n[\nwhere the sign means the union(or combination) of the two intervals. We use\n[\nthesetandintervalnotationandthesymbolsdescribedbecauseitiseasierthan\nhaving to write everything out in words.\n3.1.4 Example Functions\nInthissectionwewilllookatseveralexamplesoffunctions. Herewewillletgoof\nour real-world examples, and look exclusively at real valued functions, because\nonly in such cases do we see the full use and power of functional mathematics.\nWhile it is instructive to see a menu or people\u2019s height as a function, it is\nnot very interesting. On the other hand, all of advanced physics and statistics\ndepend on real valued functions. Very little is more important than gaining an\n42 intuitivegraspofrealfunctions,andwewillspendtheremainderofthischapter\ndoing just that.\nWhen considering real valued functions, our major tool is drawing graphs.\nIn the flrst place, if we have two real variables, x and y, then we can assign\nvalues to them simultaneously. That is, we can say \\let x be 5 and y be 3\".\nJust as we write \\let x = 5\" for \\let x be 5\", we have the shorthand notation\n\\let (x;y) = (5;3)\" for \\let x be 5 and y be 3\". We usually think of the real\nnumbersasaninflnitelylongline,andpickinganumberasputtingadotonthat\nline. If we want to pick two numbers at the same time, we can do something\nsimilar, but now we must use two dimensions. What we do is use two lines,\none for x and one for y, and rotate the one for y, as in diagram (NOTE: insert\ndiagram). We call this the Cartesian plane.\n(NOTE: This whole y and f(x) thing needs to be cleared up | I would do\nithere, butthenit\u2019salsodiscussedaboveinthedeflnitionofafunction. Ithink\nthe problem comes with the varying uses of y, and I think a physicist would\nbe better than a mathematician to clear this up. Personally, rigorously, I don\u2019t\nreally know what\u2019s going on with this notation.)\nThe great beauty of doing this is that it allows us to \\draw\" functions, in a\nvery abstract way. Let\u2019s say that we were investigating the function f(x)=2x.\nWe could then consider all the points (x;y) such that y = f(x), i.e. y = 2x.\nFor example, (1;2);(2:5;5); and (3;6) would all be such points, whereas (3;5)\nwould not since 5=2 3. If we put a dot at each of those points, and then at\n6 \u00a3\nevery similar one for all possible values of x, we would obtain the graph shown\nin (NOTE: put in).\nTheformofthisgraphisverypleasing|itisasimplestraightlinethrough\nthe middle of the plane. Now some of you may have guessed this graph long\nbeforeweplotted it, butthepointisthatthetechniqueof\\plotting\", whichwe\nhave followed here, is the key element in understanding functions. To show you\nwhy, we will now consider whole classes of functions, and we will relate them\nby the simple fact that their graphs are nearly identical.\nStraight Line Functions\nThese functions have the general form\nf(x)=ax+b (3.4)\nwhere a and b are constants. The value of a is called the gradient or slope and\ntellsushowsteepthelineis(thelargerthenumber,thesteepertheline). Ifais\ngreaterthanzeroitmeansthelineincreasesfromlefttoright(slopesupwards),\nifitissmallerthanzerothelineincreasesfromrighttoleft(slopesdownwards).\nb is called the y-intercept and tells us where the line goes through the y-axis.\nForexamplethefunctionf(x)=2x+3hasagradientof2anday-intercept\nof3. Thismeansthatthelinecutsthroughthey-axisatavalueof3andslopes\nupwards. We can calculate the values of y for certain values of x and then plot\nthem in a graph (see flgure 3.2).\nx: -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5\ny =2x+3: -7 -5 -3 -1 1 3 5 7 9 11 13\n43 (cid:1)\n12\n(cid:1)\n9 (cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n6\n(cid:1)\n3 (cid:1)\n3\n\u00a12 (cid:1)\n(cid:1)\n5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 (cid:1)\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n3 (cid:1)\n\u00a1\n(cid:1)\n6\n\u00a1\n(cid:1)(cid:1)\nFigure 3.2: Graph of f(x)=2x+3\nHowever we only need two points to plot a straight line graph. The easiest\npoints to use are the x-intercept (where the line cuts the x-axis) and the y-\nintercept. The x-intercept occurs when y =0, so it is always equal to a. So if\n\u00a1b\nasked to plot a straight line, there is no need to calculate lots of y values, you\njust need to flnd the x and y intercepts and draw a line through them.\nParabolic Functions\nA parabola looks like a hill, either upside down (for a \\positive\" parabola) or\nright way up (for a \\negative\" one), which is the same on both sides, as in the\ndiagrams (NOTE: put in):\nYou may have noted that when we say the parabola is \\the same on both\nsides\",wearejuststatingthatthesefunctionsarehorizontallysymmetric. This\nmeansthatifyou(cid:176)ipthemfromlefttorightalongaspeciflcline,whichiscalled\nthe line of symmetry, they look the same. This line of symmetry is sometimes\ncalled the axis of symmetry.\nParabolic functions are functions of the form\nf(x)=ax2+bx+c (3.5)\nwhere a, b and c are constants. The a involves the shape of the parabola and\nsays how steep the curves are. If a is positive, then the hill is upside-down. If a\nisnegative,thenthehillistherightwayup. cisthey-intercept,whichiswhere\nthe parabola cuts the y axis. b has to do with the shift in the parabola to the\nleft or the right. Two important features of the parabola are its turning point\nand line of symmetry(described above). The turning point says how high the\nhill is. If the hill is the right way up, then the turning point is the maximum\nvalue of the parabola, and if it is upside-down, then the turning point is the\nminimum value.\nNow the above form of the parabola is the standard form. It can also be\n44 written in the form\nf(x)=a(x p)2+q (3.6)\n\u00a1\nwherethetwonewconstantspandqgivetheturningpoint(p;q)oftheparabola.\nThisformoftheparabolacanbeobtainedfromthestandardformbycompleting\nthe square (See algebra). The value p of the turning point is actually the\nline of symmetry. So if p = 3, then x = 3 is the line of symmetry(which is\nalways vertical for the parabola). q is the maximum or minimum value of the\nfunction(that is the maximum or minimum value of y).\nAt flrst it might seem di\u2013cult to sketch the graph of a parabola but once a\nsimpleprocedureisfollowed,thenitbecomeseasier. Whensketchingthegraph,\nweneedtousesomeinformationaboutit. Theonlyinformationwehaveareits\nshape, x and y-intercepts and its turning point. We start ofi by seeing whether\nthe parabola is an hill that is the right way up or upside-down. Recall that\nwe can flnd this out from the sign of a. Next we calculate the x-intercepts by\nsetting y =0 and solving the equation\n0=ax2+bx+c (3.7)\nwhich doesn\u2019t always have a solution, meaning that not all parabolas cut the\nx-axis. These would be hills which never quite make it to the x-axis, or upside-\ndown hills which are never low enough to touch the x-axis. However, if there\nis one solution, and it is not zero, then because of the symmetry there must be\ntwosolutionswhichcanbebothpositive,ornegativeoraplusandaminusone.\n(NOTE: max/min turning points.)\nThe y-intercept is just c. Last we flnd the turning point of the parabola.\nOne way is to write the equation of the parabola in the form 3.6 and we have\nfound p and q. Another way is to calculate x = b, the line of symmetry and\n\u00a12a\nalso the value of p. q is found by putting p in the equation of the parabola. So\nnow we are able to plot some points and join them up to form a parabola.\nWe can create a table of x and y values for the parabola f(x)=x2 9 and\n\u00a1\nthen plot them (see flgure 3.3). Note that you could spot the symmetry of the\ngraph by examining the table alone, where we see that x = 1 and x = 1 give\n\u00a1\nthe same value for y. Note also that for this parabola b = 0, so the line of the\nsymmetry is the y-axis since the parabola looks the same on both sides of the\ny-axis.\nx: -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\ny =x2 9: 7 0 -5 -8 -9 -8 -5 0 7\n\u00a1\nHyperbolic Functions\nHyperbolas look like 2 parabolas on their side which are mirror re(cid:176)ections of\neachotheraroundthediagonal (NOTE: sketch). Hyperbolicfunctionslook like\na\nf(x)= +b (3.8)\nx\nwhere a and b are constants. Just like for parabolas, a tells us how steep the\ncurves are and b tells us how high the curves are.\n45 (cid:2) (cid:2)\n6\n4\n2\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\n3 2 1 1 2 3\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n2\n\u00a1\n4\n\u00a1\n(cid:2) (cid:2)\n6\n\u00a1\n8 (cid:2) (cid:2)\n\u00a1\n(cid:2)\nFigure 3.3: Graph of the parabola f(x)=x2 9\n\u00a1\nSince we cannot divide by zero1, it is not possible to have x=0, so there is\nno y-intercept. When you go far enough away from the y-axes, the curves start\nto look like straight lines, and we call them asymptotes.\nFor example we can create a table of x and y values for the hyperbolic\nfunction f(x)= 4 and plot them (see flgure 3.4)\nx\nx: -8 -4 -2 -1 -1 1 1 2 4 8\n2 2\nf(x)= 4 : -1 -1 -2 -4 -8 8 4 2 1 1\nx 2 2\nExponential Functions\ny =abx+c b>0 (3.9)\n3.2 Exponentials and Logarithms\nThe syllabus requires:\n(grade 12) switch between log and exp form of an equation\n\u2020\n(grade 12) derive and use the laws of logs\n\u2020\n(NOTE: need an intro. this should have lots of stufi about how people used\nexp/logs to multiply numbers by adding them. with a few examples... to show\nthat you don\u2019t need a calculator.)\n1(NOTE:i\u2019msurethereareinterestingfactsaboutdividingbyzero(notthatiknowof|\nluke))\n46 8 (cid:3)\n6\n4 (cid:3)\n2 (cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n8 6 4 2 2 4 6 8 (cid:3)\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 (cid:3)\n2 (cid:3)\n\u00a1\n4 (cid:3)\n\u00a1\n6\n\u00a1\n8 (cid:3)\n\u00a1\nFigure 3.4: Graph of the hyperbola f(x)= 4\nx\n3.2.1 Exponential Functions\n(NOTE: need an intro. we already covered exponentials in \\numbers\", but\nmaybe we should move it here instead.)\n3.2.2 Logarithmic Functions\n(NOTE: these Laws need introduced properly with more detailed derivations\nand examples of their use, highlight each ones importance. rewrite the intro to\nnot include so many new terms... and to read better for a 16 year old.)\nLogarithms, commonly referred to as Logs, are the algebraic inverse of ex-\nponents.

If it is already positive, then there is no change, and otherwise the\nsign of this term changes.\nNow an absolute value function has the following general form\nf(x)=ax b +c (3.12)\nj \u00a1 j\nwhere a, b and c are constants.\nLet us again consider an absolute value function with the general form y =\nax b +c. We must consider two cases separately:\nj \u00a1 j\nx b:\n\u201a\nNow, since x b and thus x b 0, the term inside the absolute value sign\n\u201a \u00a1 \u201a\nis positive and therefore x b =x b. Thus\nj \u00a1 j \u00a1\ny =a(x b)+c=ax+(c ab) (3.13)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nIn other words, this is a straight line with slope a and y-intercept c ab.\n\u00a1\nx<b:\nInthiscase,thetermintheabsolutevaluesignisnegativeandthus x b =\nj \u00a1 j\n(x b)= x+b. Therefore\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\ny =a( x+b)+c= ax+(c+ab) (3.14)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nwhich is a straight line with slope a and y-intercept c+ab.\n\u00a1\n50 Now at x = b the function value is y = a0 +c = c. Therefore function\nj j\nconsists of half of two straight lines with slopes a and a, which meet at the\n\u00a1\nturning point (b;c).\nThe function has the axis of symmetry x = b. In other words, the part of\nthe function on one side of the vertical line x = b is the same as the re(cid:176)ection\nabout this line of the part of the function on the other side. We can see this as\nfollows:\nConsider the function values at the points x = b+z and x = b z, where\n\u00a1\nz > 0 (these are two point the same distance from the line x = b). Now the\nfunction values at these two points are\nf(b+z) =a(b+z) b +c (3.15)\nj \u00a1 j\n=az +c (3.16)\nj j\n=az+c (3.17)\nand\nf(b z) =a(b z) b +c (3.18)\n\u00a1 j \u00a1 \u00a1 j\n=a z +c (3.19)\nj\u00a1 j\n=az+c (3.20)\nThese function values are the same. Therefore, whether we move to the left\nor the right of the line x = b, the function values remain the same. Therefore\nx=b is an axis of symmetry.\nx=b\nz z\naz+c\n(cid:4)\n(b;c)\nb z b+z\n\u00a1\nFigure 3.8: Graph of f(b+z) and f(b z) where f(x)=ax +c; with the line\n\u00a1 j j\nof symmetry x=b\nNow let us consider two cases: a<0 and a>0.\nIfaispositive, thenthelineontheleft oftheturningpoint (with slope a)\n\u00a1\nwill have a negative slope and the line on the right (with slope a) will have a\npositive slope. Thus the graph will be shaped like a V.\n51 Otherwise, if a is negative, then the line on the left has the positive slope\na and the line on the right has the negative slope a. Therefore the graph is\n\u00a1\nan upsidedown V.\n(b;c)\n(cid:6)\n(b;c) (cid:5)\na>0 a<0\nFigure 3.9: Graph of f(b+z) and f(b z) where f(x) = ax +c. One case is\n\u00a1 j j\nfor a>0 the other for a<0.\nNotice also that an absolute value function does not necessarily have x-\nintercepts. It these do exist, then they will be the x-intercepts of the two\nstraight lines making up the absolute value function.\n52 Chapter 4\nNumerics\n4.1 Optimisation\nThe syllabus requires:\nLinear Programming (Grade 11)\n\u2020\n1. Solve linear programming problems by optimising a function\nin two variables, subject to one or more linear constraints,\nby numerical search along the boundary of the feasible region.\n2. Solve a system of linear equations to find the co-ordinates\nof the vertices of the feasible region.\nIn everyday life people are interested in knowing the most e\u2013cient way of\ncarrying out a task or achieving a goal. For example, a farmer might want\nto know how many crops to plant during a season in order to maximise yield\n(produce) or a stock broker might want to know how much to invest in stocks\nin order to maximise proflt. These are examples of optimisation problems,\nwhere by optimising we mean flnding the maxima or minima of a function.\nThis function we wish to optimise (i.e. maximise or minimise) is called the\nobjective function (we will only be looking at objective functions which are\nfunctions of two variables). In the case of the farmer, the objective function\nis the yield and it is dependent on the amount of crops planted. If the farmer\nhas two crops then we can express the yield as f(x;y) where the variable x\nrepresents the amount of the flrst crop planted and y the amount of the second\ncropplanted. Forthestockbroker,assumingthattherearetwostockstoinvest\nin, f(x;y) is the amount of proflt earned by investing x rand in the flrst stock\nand y rand in the second.\nIn practice it is often that constraints, or restrictions, are placed on x and\ny. Themostcommonoftheseconstraintsisthenon-negativityconstraint. That\nis, we might require that x 0 and y 0. For the farmer, it would make little\n\u201a \u201a\nsense if we were to speak of planting a negative amount of crops and so when\noptimising f(x;y) the constraints x 0 and y 0 must be considered. Other\n\u201a \u201a\nconstraintsmightbethatthefarmercannotplantmoreofthesecondcropthan\nthe flrst crop and that no more than 20 units of the flrst crop can be planted;\nthese constraints translate into the inequalities x y and x 20. Constraints\n\u201a \u2022\n53 mean that we can\u2019t just take any x and y when looking for the x and y that\noptimise our objective function. If we think of the variables x and y as a point\n(x;y) in the xy plane then we call the set of all points in the xy plane that\nsatisfy our constraints the feasible region. Any point in the feasible region is\ncalled a feasible point.\ny\n20\n15\n10\n5\nx\n5 10 15 20\nFigure 4.1: The feasible region corresponding to the constraints x 0, y 0,\n\u201a \u201a\nx y and x 20.\n\u201a \u2022\nFor example, the non-negativity constraints x 0 and y 0 mean that\n\u201a \u201a\nevery (x;y) we can consider must lie in the flrst quadrant of the xy plane. The\nconstraint x y means that every (x;y) must lie on or below the line y = x\n\u201a\nand x 20 means that x must lie on or to the left of the line x=20. For these\n\u2022\nconstraints the feasibility region is illustrated as the shaded region in Figure\n4.1.\nConstraints that have the form ax+by c or ax+by =c are called linear\n\u2022\nconstraints.

Interpretingconstraintsasgraphsinthexyplane\nis very important since it allows us to construct the feasible region such as in\nFigure 4.1. We have the following rule for any linear constraint:\na c\nax+by =c If b=0, feasible points must lie on the line y = x+ :\n6 \u00a1b b\nIf b=0, feasible points must lie on the line x=c=a\na c\nax+by c If b=0, feasible points must lie on or below the line y = x+ :\n\u2022 6 \u00a1b b\nIf b=0, feasible points must lie on or to the left of the line x=c=a\nOnce we have determined the feasible region the solution of our problem\nwillbethefeasiblepointwheretheobjectivefunctionisamaximum/minimum.\nSometimes there will be more than one feasible point where the objective func-\ntion is a maximum/minimum | in this case we have more than one solution.\n54 4.1.1 Linear Programming\nThe objective function is called linear if it looks like f(x;y) = ax+by where\nthe coe\u2013cients a and b are real numbers. For example, f(x;y) = 10x y is a\n\u00a1\nlinear objective function. If the objective function and all of the constraints are\nlinear then we call the problem of optimising the objective function subject to\nthese constraints a linear program. All optimisation problems we will look at\nwill be linear programs.\nThe major consequence of the constraints being linear is that the feasible\nregion is always a polygon. This is evident since the constraints that deflne the\nfeasible region all contribute a line segment to its boundary (see Figure 4.1). It\nis also always true that the feasible region is a convex polygon.\nTheobjectivefunctionbeinglinearmeansthatthefeasiblepoint(s)thatgives\nthe solution of a linear program always lies on one of the vertices of the feasible\nregion. This is very important since, as we will soon see, it gives us a way\nof solving linear programs. (NOTE: Should I mention that a linear objective\nfunction deflnes a plane? This is crucial to the fact that optimal solutions are\nobtained at the vertices, though. Do Grade 11s know the equation of a plane?\nIwouldliketousetheideathatthelevelsetsofplanesarelinesandinsodoing\njustify the \\ruler\" method.)\nWe will now see why the solutions of a linear program always lie on the\nverticesofthefeasibleregion. Firstly,notethatifwethinkoff(x;y)aslyingon\nthezaxis,thenthefunctionf(x;y)=ax+by(whereaandbarerealnumbers)is\nthe deflnition of a plane. If we solve for y in the equation deflning the objective\nfunction then\nf(x;y)=ax+by\na f(x;y)\n) y = \u00a1 x+ (4.1)\nb b\nWhat this means is that if we flnd all the points where f(x;y)=c for any real\nnumber c (i.e. f(x;y) is constant with a value of c), then we have the equation\nofaline. Thislinewecallalevel lineoftheobjectivefunction(NOTE:Should\nI use this terminology?). Consider again the feasible region described in Figure\n4.1. Lets say that we have the objective function f(x;y) = x 2y with this\n\u00a1\nfeasible region. If we consider Equation 4.1 corresponding to f(x;y) = 20\n\u00a1\nthen we we get the level line y = 1x+10 which has been drawn in Figure 4.2.\n2\nLevel lines corresponding to f(x;y) = 10 (y = x +5), f(x;y) = 0 (y = x),\n\u00a1 2 2\nf(x;y)=10 (y = x 5) and f(x;y)=20 (y = x 10) have also been drawn in.\n2 \u00a1 2 \u00a1\nItisveryimportanttorealisethatthesearen\u2019ttheonlylevellines;infact,there\nare inflnitely many of them and they are all parallel to each other. Remember\nthat if we look at any one level line f(x;y) has the same value for every point\n(x;y) that lies on that line. Also, f(x;y) will always have difierent values on\ndifierent level lines.\nIfarulerisplacedonthelevellinecorrespondingtof(x;y)= 20inFigure\n\u00a1\n4.2 and moved down the page parallel to this line then it is clear that the ruler\nwill be moving over level lines which correspond to larger values of f(x;y). So\nif we wanted to maximise f(x;y) then we simply move the ruler down the page\nuntil we reach the \\lowest\" point in the feasible region|this point will then be\nthe feasible point that maximises f(x;y). Similarly, if we wanted to minimise\nf(x;y) then the \\highest\" feasible point will give the minimum value of f(x;y).\n55 y\nf(x;y)= 20\n\u00a1\n20\nf(x;y)= 10\n\u00a1\n15\nf(x;y)=0\n10\nf(x;y)=10\n5\nf(x;y)=20\nx\n5 10 15 20\nFigure 4.2: The feasible region corresponding to the constraints x 0, y 0,\n\u201a \u201a\nx y and x 20 with objective function f(x;y) = x 2y. The dashed lines\n\u201a \u2022 \u00a1\nrepresent various level lines of f(x;y).\nSince our feasible region is a polygon, these points will always lie on vertices\nin the feasible region. (NOTE: We could have inflnitely many solutions if the\ngradient of a constraint = the gradient of the level lines... should I mention\nthis?). The fact that the value of our objective function along the line of the\nruler increases as we move it down and decreases as we move it up depends\non this particular example. Some other examples might have that the function\nincreases as we move the ruler up and decreases as we move it down. It is a\ngeneralproperty,though,oflinearobjectivefunctionsthattheywillconsistently\nincreaseordecreaseaswemovetherulerupordown. Knowingwhichdirection\nto move the ruler in order to maximise/minimise f(x;y)=ax+by is as simple\naslookingatthesignofb(i.e. \\isbnegative,positiveorzero?\"). Ifbispositive,\nthen f(x;y) increases as we move the ruler up and f(x;y) decreases as we move\nthe ruler down. The opposite happens for the case when b is negative: f(x;y)\ndecreases as we move the ruler up and f(x;y) increases as we move the ruler\ndown. Ifb=0thenweneedtolookatthesignofa. Ifaispositivethenf(x;y)\nincreasesaswemovetherulertotherightanddecreasesifwemovetherulerto\nthe left. Once again, the opposite happens for a negative. If we look again at\nthe objective function mentioned earlier, f(x;y) = x 2y (a = 1 and b = 2),\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nthen we should flnd that f(x;y) increases as we move the ruler down the page\nsince b= 2<0. This is exactly what we found happening in Figure 4.2.\n\u00a1\nThe main points about linear programming we have encountered so far are\nThe feasible region is always a polygon.\n\u2020\nSolutions occur at vertices of the feasible region.\n\u2020\nMovingarulerparalleltothelevellinesoftheobjectivefunctionup/down\n\u2020\nto the top/bottom of the feasible region shows us which of the vertices is\nthe solution.\nThe direction in which to move the ruler is determined by the sign of b\n\u2020\nand also possibly by the sign of a.\n56 (NOTE: I would like to mention f to determine \u2018the direction in which to\nr\nmove the ruler\u2019. Even if I neglect the fact that students certainly know nothing\nabout partial difierentiation, I\u2019m still not sure whether I can mention and work\nwith vectors in the plane...)\nThese points are su\u2013cient to determine a method for solving any linear\nprogram. If we wish to maximise the objective function f(x;y) then:\n1. Find the gradient of the level lines of f(x;y) (this is always going to be\na as we saw in Equation 4.1)\n\u00a1b\n2. Place your ruler on the xy plane, making a line with gradient a (i.e. b\n\u00a1b\nunits on the x-axis and a units on the y-axis)\n\u00a1\n3. The solution of the linear program is given by appropriately moving the\nruler. Firstly we need to check whether b is negative, positive or zero.\n(a) If b > 0, move the ruler up the page, keeping the ruler parallel to\nthelevellinesallthetime, untilittouchesthe\\highest\"pointinthe\nfeasible region. This point is then the solution.\n(b) If b<0, move the ruler in the opposite direction to get the solution\nat the \\lowest\" point in the feasible region.\n(c) If b=0, check the sign of a\ni. If a < 0 move the ruler to the \\leftmost\" feasible point. This\npoint is then the solution.\nii. If a > 0 move the ruler to the \\rightmost\" feasible point. This\npoint is then the solution.\n(NOTE:Point3isessentiallytryingtoworkwith f withoutactuallyknow-\nr\ning what it is or that it exists!)\n4.2 Gradient\nThe syllabus requires:\nInvestigate numerically the average gradient between two points\n\u2020\non a curve and develop an intuitive understanding of the concept\nof the gradient of a curve at a point (NOTE: this is undefined\nif this should be numerical, or an intro to differentiation. perhaps\nit is best to have it spread over both)\n4.3 Old Content (please delete when flnished)\n4.3.1 Problems\nWe often have to solve problems in which there are several variables, which\nwe can change to suit us. We can now develop a method of dealing with such\nproblems.\n57 Worked Example 1:\nQ:Afarmergrowswheatandmaize. Hehas20fleldsofavailablelandonwhich\nhecanplantcrops. Hemustgrowatleast5fleldsofmaize.

This is the maximum x value which is in the feasible region. This\noccurs at the point (15,5). Thus the maximum x value is 15. Remembering to\ngive the answer in terms of the original question:\nThe farmer can plant a maximum of 15 flelds of wheat.\n4.3.2 Maximising or Minimising the Objective Function\nTheobjectivefunctionisafunctionofxandy.

It was always one of my ambitions to attend the University of\nCapeTown(UCT)becauseitisaprestigiousuniversity. Iappliedtostudymedicine\nat UCT, but was not accepted, and so I enrolled for a science degree at UCT\nand have never regretted it. (I can stand only so much visible blood.) I wasn\u2019t\nsure about what I wanted to do with my life so I enrolled for Mathematics, Applied\nMathematics,ChemistryandPhysicsinmyflrstyearatuniversity. Bytheendofmy\nflrst year at UCT, I wanted to continue with the Mathematics stream. I completed\nby Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree with majors (main subjects) Mathematics and\nApplied Mathematics and then completed my BSc (Honours) degree in Applied\nMathematics. I completed by Master of Science degree in Financial Mathematics\nandamcurrentlyregisteredforthedegreeofDoctorofPhilosophyinMathematics.\nDifierentiation in the Financial World\nMost of us don\u2019t really think about saving our money to buy something in\nthe future - we have to spend it now! Our parents unfortunately (and one day\nwhen we\u2019re older most probably we too) have to save for the future: for that\npossible time when they don\u2019t have a job; they may save to purchase furniture\nfor the house; or a present for your birthday. The most important thing adults\nsaveforisretirement-thisiswhentheydecidethattheywanttostopworking.\nTheirkidsmaynotbeabletocareforthembecausetheytoomayhavefamilies\nor may not have jobs themselves. So, adults have to save money while they are\n62 working to support them when they retire. The amount of money they receive\nafter they retire is called their pension - so adults save so that they can receive\na pension when they retire.\nSupposeJamesispayingR100everymonthtowardhispension. WhenJames\nretires,hewantseverymonthtoreceiveabitmorethantheR100hecontributed\ntoward his pension (while he was working). If he doesn\u2019t get a bit more than\nR100pensioneverymonth(whenheretires),thenhemayaswellsavehismoney\nunder his bed until he retires. Now, there are many adults like James who are\nsavingfortheirpension. Towhomdoalltheseadultspaytheirmonthlypension\nsavings? They pay their monthly pensions savings to a pension fund. Suppose\nthere are ten million adults paying R100 every month to a pension fund. That\nmeans that each month the pension fund receives R100x10 000 000 = R1b (i.e.\none billion rand) in total each month.\nNow, each adult, like James, will want to receive a monthly pension which\nis greater than R100 when they retire. So, the pension fund must ensure that,\nwhenapensionfundcontributorretires,he/shereceivesmorethanR100pension\neverymonth. Therearemanypensionfundsintheworld,so,ifthepensionfund\nJames is saving with is going to give him a R110 monthly pension and another\npension fund is going to give him a R120 monthly pension, then he is going to\nsave with the latter pension fund. So, pension funds can\u2019t give pensioners too\nlittle pension. Infact, theyhave togivepensionersasbig apensionaspossible.\nNow, the pension fund can\u2019t just put the monthly R1bn in the bank and let it\nearn interest and divide this amongst all pensioners. The government takes a\nlotoftheinterestearnedbypensionfundsastax. So,thepensionfundshaveto\nmake more money, and so they turn to the stock market. But the thing about\nthe stock market is that one can lose a lot of money very quickly if one is not\ncareful. The advantage about putting one\u2019s money in the bank is that, when\nyou come back the next day, your money will still be there. If you invest in the\nstock market today and you come back tomorrow, then you could have lost a\nsubstantial amount ofmoney, butyoucouldalso havemade alot ofmoney. So,\nfor the pension fund, depositing the monthly R1b with the bank is appealing,\nbut so is the stock market. The pension has to flnd the best combination of\nthe two (the bank and the stock market). That involves, flnding out how much\nmoney to deposit with the bank and how much to invest in the stock market so\nthatthepensionfundmakesasmuchmoneyaspossible. Tosolvethisproblem,\ninvolves difierentiation, which is the topic of the next chapter. This is just one\nway in which difierentiation is used in the flnancial world.\n63 Chapter 5\nDifierentiation\n5.1 Limit and Derivative\nCalculusisfundamentallydifierentfromthemathematicsthatyouhavestudied\npreviously. Calculusismoredynamicandlessstatic. Itisconcernedwithchange\nand motion. It deals with quantities that approach other quantities. For that\nreason it may be useful to have an overview of the subject before beginning its\nintensive study. In this section we give a glimpse of some of the main ideas\nof calculus by showing how limits arise when we attempt to solve a variety of\nproblems.\n5.1.1 Gradients and limits\nA traditional slingshot is essentially a rock on the end of a string, which you\nrotate around in a circular motion and then release. When you release the\nstring, in which direction will the rock travel? Many people mistakenly believe\nthat the rock will follow a curved path. Newton\u2019s First Law of Motion tells us\nthat the path is straight. In fact, the rock follows a path along the tangent\nline to the circle, at the point of release. If we wanted to determine the path\nfollowed by the rock, we could do so, as tangent lines to circles are relatively\neasy to flnd. Recall, from elementary geometry that a tangent line to a circle is\na line that intersects the circle in exactly one point. In this chapter we will be\nconcerned with tangent lines to a variety of functions, as the tangent line gives\nus the slope of a function at a point.\nNowletusconsidertheproblemoftryingtoflndtheequationofthetangent\nline t to a curve with equation y =f(x) at a given point P.\n64 P f(x)\nSince we know that the point P lies on the tangent line, we can flnd out the\nequation of t if we know its slope m. The problem is that we need two points\nto compute the slope and we only have one, namely P on t. To get around the\nproblemweflrstflndanapproximation tombytakinganearbypointQonthe\ncurve and computing the slope m of the secant line PQ.\nPQ\nQ\nP f(x)\nx a\n65 From the flgure we see that\nf(x) f(a)\nm = \u00a1 (5.1)\nPQ\nx a\n\u00a1\nNowimaginethatQmovesalongthecurvetowardP.Thesecantlineapproaches\nthe tangent line as its limiting position. This means that the slope m of the\nPQ\nsecant line becomes closer and closer to the slope m of the tangent line as Q\napproaches P. We write\nm= lim m\nPQ\nQ P\n!\nandwesaythatmisthelimitofm asQapproachesP alongthecurve. Since\nPQ\nx approaches a as Q approaches P, we could also use Equation (5.1) to write\nf(x) f(a)\nm= lim \u00a1 (5.2)\nx a x a\n! \u00a1\nThetangentproblemhasgivenrisetothebranchofcalculuscalleddifierential\ncalculus.\n5.1.2 Difierentiating f(x) = xn\nThecentralconceptofdifierentialcalculusisthederivative.

Then see if you can generalise what you are\nseeing to write down a formula for f (x) where f(x) = xn. (This isn\u2019t a valid\n0\n66 mathematicalwayofarrivingataformula, butifyouwanttoprovethegeneral\ncase you need to use the binomial theorem, which is outside the scope of your\nsyllabus.)\nHopefully you calculated the derivative of f(x)=x3 to be 3x2, and shortly\nafter that spotted the pattern for powers of x:\nd (xn)=nxn 1\ndx \u00a1\n5.1.3 Other notations\nIf we use the traditional notation y = f(x) to indicate that the dependent\nvariable is y and the independent variable is x, then some common alternative\nnotations for the derivative are as follows:\ndy df d\nf (x) = y = = = f(x) = Df(x) = D f(x)\n0 0 x\ndx dx dx\nThe symbols D and d=dx are called difierential operators because they\nindicate the operation of difierentiation, which is the process of calculating a\nderivative. It is very important that you learn to identify these difierent ways\nof denoting the derivative, and that you are consistent in your usage of them\nwhen answering questions.\nNote\nThough we choose to use a fractional form of representation, dy is a limit and\ndx\nIS NOT a fraction, i.e. dy does not mean dy dx. dy means y difierentiated\ndx \u00a5 dx\nwith respect to x. Thus, dp means p difierentiated with respect to x.

This is an horizontal line, which has slope 0.\nRule 2: The Power Rule\nIf f(x)=xn, where n is an integer, then\nf (x)=nxn 1 (5.5)\n0 \u00a1\nThe Power Rule may also be written as\nd\n(xn)=nxn 1 (5.6)\n\u00a1\ndx\nThis rule applies when n is a negative number.

The slope of a function at a point is just\nits derivative.\nIf we want to flnd a general formula for a tangent to a function, we difier-\nentiate the function. To flnd the slope of the tangent at a particular point, we\nsubstitute that point\u2019s x value into the function\u2019s derivative. This will give us\na single value, which is the slope of a straight line. We\u2019ll look at one of these\nproblems in the Worked Examples (section 5.4).\n68 5.3.2 Curve Sketching\nSupposewearegiventhatf(x)=ax3+bx2+cx+dandweareaskedtosketch\nthegraphofthisfunction.

What is a degree... why\nis it out of 360... etc.)\n6.1 Polygons\nThe syllabus requires:\ndevelop conjectures related to triangles, quadrilaterals and other\n\u2020\npolygons. attempt to justify, explain or prove these conjectures\nusing any logical method\ndefine various polygons (isosceles, equilateral, right angled\n\u2020\ntriangles, trapezium, isosceles trapezium, kite, parallelogram,\nrectangle, rhombus, square and the regular polygons)\ncan tell when polygons are similar. equilateral triangles are\n\u2020\nsimilar\nthe line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle divides the\n\u2020\nother 2 sides proportionally\nA polygon is a shape or flgure with many straight sides. A polygon has interior\nangles. These are the angles that are inside the polygon. The number of sides\nofapolygonequalsthenumberofinteriorangles. Ifapolygonhasequallength\nsides and equal interior angles then the polygon is called a regular polygon.\n(NOTE:thelanguageusedinthisnotationsectionsometimesaimstoohigh;\nwords like \\denote\" and \\line segment\" may be daunting when simpler words\nmay be used. the audience is only 15 and all of this is new to them. everything\nneeds explained in detail, using simple language... and diagrams help too.)\nWe denote a line segment that extends between a point A and some point\nB by line AB. The length of this line is just AB. So if we say, AB = CD we\nmean that the length of the line segment from A to B is equal to the length of\nthe line segment from C to D.\n76 A~B is the line segment with length AB and direction from point A to point\nB. Similarly, B~A is the line segment with length AB =BA and direction from\npoint B to point A.\nSuppose we have two line segments AB and BC that join at a point B. We\ndenote the angle B between the line segments by B^.\nA line of symmetry divides a shape in such a way that it appears the same\non both sides of the line. For example, if you divide a square along its one\ndiagonal then you divide it into two triangles that are exactly the same i.e.\nthey flt perfectly on each other when the square is folded along the diagonal. If\na line AB bisects a line CD then AB divides CD into half.\nA stop sign is in the shape of an octagon, an eight-sided polygon. Some\ncoins are heptagonal and hexagonal. In the UK there are two heptagonal coins.\nThe honeycomb of a beehive consist of hexagonal cells. (NOTE: these are true\nexamples, but maybe best left till the list of names of polygons. examples here\nshould try to motivate the study of polygons... how can we actually use the\nstudy of polygons to enrich our lives.)\n6.1.1 Triangles\nA triangle is a three-sided polygon. The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 .\n\u2013\nThe exterior angle of any corner of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two\nopposite interior angles (NOTE: a diagram for these 2 rules). We have the\nfollowing triangles:\nEquilateral\nAll 3 sides are equal and each angle is 60 .\n\u2013\n(NOTE: need an example diagram)\nIsosceles\nTwo equal angles occur opposite two equal sides and vice versa.\n(NOTE: need an example diagram)\nRight-angled\nThis triangle has a right angle.

If the other pair of opposite sides is also parallel then the trapezium\nis a parallelogram. Another type of trapezium is the isosceles trapezium, where\none pair of opposite sides is parallel, the other pair of sides is equal and the\nangles at the ends of each parallel side are equal. An isosceles trapezium has\none line of symmetry and its diagonals are equal in length. (NOTE: need an\nexample diagram)\nParallelogram\nA parallelogram is a special type of trapezium. It is a quadrilateral with two\npairs of opposite sides equal. Squares, rectangles and rhombuses are paral-\nlelograms. We have the following properties of parallelograms. Both pairs of\nopposite sides are parallel. Both pairs of opposite sides are equal in length.\n(NOTE: what does equal mean? is it in length, or direction, or both? we must\nbe more precise in our wording) Both pairs of opposite angles are equal. Both\ndiagonals bisect each other (i.e. they cut each other in half). There are not\nalways lines of symmetry. (NOTE: what is a line of symmetry? we haven\u2019t\nmentioned them before here. is this really a property?)\n(NOTE: need an example diagram)\nRectangle\nThis is a parallelogram with 90 angles.\n\u2013\n\u2020\nBoth pairs of opposite sides are parallel.

What would happen if we\ndeflned the function y = f(x a), where a is some positive constant? Well,\n\u00a1\nthe value of y at x is really just the value of the function f at x a moved to\n\u00a1\nthe point x. In other words, this deflnes the graph we would get if we shifted\n82 the function f(x) by a to the right. (NOTE: Shifting is not really a good\nmathematical term... can we call it translation instead?)\nSimilarly, the function y =f(x+a), is the result of shifting the function by\na to the left (the function value at x+a is moved to x).\nf(x) f(x a) f(x+a) f(x)\n\u00a1\na a\nFigure 6.1: Graph of a function with the translations x x+a and x x a.\n! ! \u00a1\nNote that this is just a simple shift either left or right of the entire graph.\nNow let us look at the function y b = f(x), where b is some positive\n\u00a1\nconstant, which is the result of replacing y by y b in the function y = f(x).\n\u00a1\nThis gives us that y = f(x)+b. The function is thus shifted upwards by the\nconstant b.\nWe can also replace y by y +b, which again just results in movement in\nthe opposite direction. We can see this because y + b = f(x) implies that\ny =f(x) b, which shows that f(x) has been shifted downwards by b.\n\u00a1\nf(x)+b\nf(x)\nb b\nf(x)\nf(x) b\n\u00a1\nFigure6.2: Graphofsin(x)withthetranslationsy y+bandb y b. Note\n! ! \u00a1\nthat this is just a simple shift either up or down of the entire graph.\nNow, what about relations in general? If we take a relation, which depends\non x and y, and replaced x by x a and y by y b (where a and b are positive\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n83 constants), then what would happen? Well, the relation value at the point\n(x a;y b) would be moved to the point (x;y). Therefore the graph of the\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nrelation would be shifted right by a and upwards by b. Similarly, if we replaced\nx by x+a and y by y +b, then the function would be moved left by a and\ndownwards by b.\nRe(cid:176)ections\nNow consider deflning y = f( x), where f(x) is a known function. This takes\n\u00a1\nthe function value at the point x to the point x. In other words, the function\n\u00a1\nvalues on one side of the y-axis are moved to the other side of the y-axis. Thus\nthe function is re(cid:176)ected about the y-axis.\nAlternatively we can look at the function y = f(x). This is the same as\n\u00a1\nsaying y = f(x), which re(cid:176)ects the function about the x-axis (every positive\n\u00a1\nfunction value is changed to the corresponding negative function value and vice\nversa).\nf(x) f( x) f(x)\n\u00a1\nf(x)\n\u00a1\nFigure 6.3: Graph of a function with the re(cid:176)ections x x and f(x)\n! \u00a1 !\nf(x). Note that these are just re(cid:176)ections in the vertical and horizontal axes,\n\u00a1\nrespectively.\nAs before, we can generalise these idea to deal with relations. In all cases,\nif we change x to x, then the relation will be re(cid:176)ected about the y-axis and if\n\u00a1\nwe replace y by y then there will be a re(cid:176)ection about the x-axis.\n\u00a1\nNote: We say that f(x) is symmetric about the y axis if f(x) = f( x)\n\u00a1\n(in other words, the function and its re(cid:176)ection about the y-axis are the same).\nSimilarly,iff(x)= f(x),thenwesaythatf(x)issymmetricaboutthex-axis.\n\u00a1\n6.5 Stretching and Shrinking Graphs\n(NOTE: The flgures are correct, but i think the flgures are negating the truth.)\nWeshallnowlookatwhathappenstof(x)ifweconsiderthefunctiony =f(ax),\nwhere a is a positive constant and a>1. The point ax on the x-axis is further\n84 fromthey-axisthanx(since ax > x). Nowthefunctionvalueataxismoved\nj j j j\nto x, so the function is moved towards the x-axis by a factor of a. Thus the\nefiect is to shrink f(x) horizontally by a factor of a.\nThe function y =f(x) has the opposite efiect. The point x on the x-axis is\na a\ncloser to the y-axis than x (as x < x). The function value at x is moved to\njaj j j a\nx so the function is stretched horizontally by a factor of a.\nf(x) f(ax)\nax x\nf(x) f(x)\na\nx\nx a\nFigure 6.4: Graph of a function with the rescaling x ax and x x. Note\n! ! a\nthat these are just a shrinking and stretching in the horizontal axis.\n(NOTE: this is correct. vertical and horizontal rescalings are difierent... i\nthink the author got confused and thought the same thing happened in each.\nthis needs flxed.) Replacing y by by, where b is a positive constant and b > 1,\ngives by = f(x) and thus y = 1f(x). The function value at any point x is\nb\nreduced by a factor of b. Therefore the graph shrinks vertically by a factor of b.\nSimilarly, if we replace y with y to give y = f(x), we obtain the function\nb b\ny = bf(x). At each x value the function value is increased by a factor of b so\nthe function is stretched vertically.\nAgain these result can be used to deal with relations as well. If x and y are\n85 1f(x)\nb\nf(x)\nf(x)\nbf(x)\nFigure 6.5: Graph of a function with the rescaling f(x) 1f(x) and f(x)\n! b !\nbf(x). Note that these are just a shrinking and stretching in the vertical axis.\nreplaced by ax and by in any relation, the efiect is to shrink the graph of this\nrelation by a factor of a horizontally and by a factor of b vertically. Similarly,\nchanging x to x and y to y causes the relation to be stretched horizontally and\na b\nvertically by factors of a and b respectively.\n6.6 Mixed Problems\nIf we perform many of these transformations on a given function, then we must\ncombine the difierent efiects. However, it is very important that we efiect these\nchanges in the right order. Here are some examples of mixed problems.\n6.7 Equation of a Line\nThe syllabus requires:\n86 derive formula for the equation of a line when given 2 points\n\u2020\nderive formula for the line parallel to a given line and passing\n\u2020\nthrough a point\nderive formula for the inclination of a line\n\u2020\n6.8 Circles\nThe syllabus requires:\n(grade 12) tangent is perpendicular to the radius\n\u2020\n(grade 12) the line from the centre of a circle perpendicular\n\u2020\nto a chord bisects the chord\n(grade 12) angle subtended by an arc at the centre of a circle\n\u2020\nis double the size of the angle subtended by the same arc at the\ncircle\n(grade 12) the opposite angle of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary\n\u2020\nthe tangent chord theorem (NOTE: really... thats what it says,\nword for word)\n6.8.1 Circles & Semi-circles\nCircles:\nA circle centered at the origin with radius r is described by the relation\nx2+y2 =r2 (6.2)\nWe can see that a circle is not a function, since both (0;r) and (0; r)\n\u00a1\nsatisfy the relation (in other words, the line x = 0 will always cut the circle at\ntwo points).\nNow, since x2 = r2 y2 and y2 is never negative, it follows that x2 r2\n\u00a1 \u2022\nand thus r x r. Therefore the domain of the relation is [ r;r]. Similarly,\n\u00a1 \u2022 \u2022 \u00a1\ny2 =r2 x2 and therefore r y r. Thus the range of the relation is [ r;r].\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u2022 \u2022 \u00a1\nSemi-Circles:\nThe equation for a circle x2+y2 =r2 can also be written as\ny = r2 x2 (6.3)\n\u00a7 \u00a1\np\nNow let us we consider the positive and negative square roots separately.\nThese describe semi-circles on either side of the x-axis. Thus the equations for\ntwo types of semi-circles are as follows:\ny = r2 x2 and y = r2 x2 (6.4)\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\np p\nThe domain of each of these semi-circles is [ r;r] and the range is [0;r] (for\n\u00a1\nthe flrst semi-circle) and [ r;0] (for the second semi-circle).\n\u00a1\n87 Note: These semi-circles are functions, since there is only one y value\ncorresponding to each x value.\n6.9 Locus\nThe syllabus requires:\n(grade 12) derive the equation of the locus of all points; equidistant\n\u2020\nfrom a given point, equidistant from 2 given points, equidistant\nfrom a given point and a line parallel to the x or y axis\n6.10 Other Geometries\nThe syllabus requires:\nbasic knowledge of spherical geometry, taxicab geometry and fractals\n\u2020\n6.11 Unsorted\n6.11.1 Fundamental vocabulary terms\nMeasuring angles\nThe magnitude of an angle does not depend on the length of its sides; it only\ndepends on the relative direction of the two sides. E.g. the adjacent edges of\na postcard are at an angle of 90 with respect to each other. But so is the\n\u2013\nEmpire State Building in New York City with respect to Fifth Ave. and 34th\nStreet (NOTE: its SA... maybe this should be the baobab tree with respect\nto the Limpopo river (i kid... i kid)). So we can\u2019t use notions of length to\nmeasure angles. How do we measure angles then? We begin by flnding a way\nto enumerate angles. What is the smallest angle you can draw? Two lines\nsubtendingalmostnoangle. Twocoincidentlinesegmentspointinginthesame\ndirectionsubtendanangleof0 ,e.g.,linesABandAC intheflgurebelow. Now\n\u2013\nif we keep one line flxed and move the other while still pivoted at the common\nvertex,wecanobtainanyotherangle. Twolinesegmentswithacommonvertex\nand facing in opposite direction are said to form an angle of 180 , e.g. , XY\n\u2013\nand XZ in the flgure below. ZXY is a straight line.\n180\n\u2013\n0\n\u2013\nA B Z Y\n(cid:10) (cid:11)\nC X\nThe choice of a measure of 180 for the angle subtended by the segments\n\u2013\nof a straight line is a matter of historical convention. Once we have decided\nwhat the measure of an angle formed by a straight line is, we have also flxed\nthe measure of all the other angles. This is because we would like the angles\nto obey some desirable properties. E.g. if we have an angle a between two\n\u2013\nlines AB and AC, and another angle b between AB and AD, we would like\n\u2013\n88 the angle between AC and AD to be (a+b) . This makes the measurement of\n\u2013\nangles intuitive andDconforms to our notion of measurement of lBength, weight,\netc. Similarly, a line segment that deflnes a direction exactly half way between\nAB and AC should create an angle of (a=2) .\n\u2013\nB D\nb a\n\u2013 \u2013\n(a=2)\na \u2013\n\u2013\nA C A C\n(cid:12) (cid:13)\nAn angle of 90 is termed a right angle. A right angle is half the measure\n\u2013\nof the angle subtended by a straight line (180 ). An angle twice the measure\n\u2013\nof a straight line is 360 . An angle measuring 360 looks identical to an angle\n\u2013 \u2013\nof 0 , except for the labelling. All angles after 360 also look like we have seen\n\u2013 \u2013\nthem before. Angles that measure more than 360 are largely for mathematical\n\u2013\nconvenience to maintain continuity in our enumeration of angles.\nC\nRight Angle\n90 \u2013 360 \u2013\nA B A B\n(cid:14) (cid:15)\nC\nWedeflnesomeothertermsatthispoint.

E.g. if North(N) is\n0 , North-East(NE) is 45 , NNE is 22:5 , etc.\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n89 Special Angle Pairs\nIn the previous section, we classifled angles based on measurement. In this\nsection we\u2019ll examine some interesting properties of angles formed by a pair of\nintersecting lines.\nFirst we consider a single straight line, AB. There\u2019s a point on the line AB\ncalledX. ThemeasureofangleAXB is180 asdeflnedintheprevioussection.\n\u2013\nNow let us draw another straight line intersecting the flrst. Without loss of\ngenerality, let the point of intersection be X. We call the four angles formed\nwith X as the vertex a, b, c and d. At this point, we introduce some deflnitions\nfor convenience.\nC B\nb\nX\nc a\n(cid:19)\nd\nA D\nVertical angles\nDeflnition: The angles formed by two intersecting straight lines that share a\nvertex but do not share any sides are called vertical angles. E.g. , a and c in\nthe flgure above are vertical angles. b and d are also vertical angles.\nAdjacent Angles\nDeflnition: Two angles that share a common vertex and a common side are\ncalled adjacent angles. E.g. , (a;b) and (c;d) are adjacent angles.\nLinear pairs\nDeflnition: The adjacent angles formed by two intersecting straight lines are\nsaid to form a linear pair. E.g. (a;b), (b;c), (c;d) and (d;a) all form linear pairs.\nSince the non common sides of a linear pair are part of the same straight line,\nthetotalangleformedbythelinearpairis180 bydeflnition. E.g.a+b=180 ,\n\u2013 \u2013\netc.\nWhatcanwesayabouttheverticalangles? Lookingatflgureabove,itseems\nlike the vertical angles are equal to one another. We can prove the following\nresult.\nTheorem: The vertical angles formed by intersection of two straight lines are\nequal.\nProof: Since a and b form a linear pair, a+b=180 . Similiarly, b and c form\n\u2013\nalinearpair, so, b+c=180 . Thus, a+b=b+c. Sincetheanglebcontributes\n\u2013\nequally to both sides of the equation, it can be cancelled out leaving, a = c.\nThe proof for the pair (b;d) is identical.\n90 Thisproofconflrmsourintuitionthatverticalanglesareequalinmagnitude.\nThis result will later be used when proving properties for parallel lines.\nWe end this section with some more deflnitions.\nSupplementary and Complementary pairs\nDeflnition: Two angles are called supplementary if their sum equals 180 .\n\u2013\nE.g. angles that constitute a linear pair are supplementary.\nDeflnition: Two angles are called complementary if their sum equals 90 .\n\u2013\nNote that in order to be labelled supplementary or complementary, the two\nangles being considered need not be adjacent.

Infor-\nmally, two lines intersect if they meet at some point when extended indeflnitely\nin either direction. E.g. at a tra\u2013c intersection, two or more streets intersect;\nthe middle of the intersection is the common point between the streets.\nIt is possible that two lines that lie on the same plane never intersect even\nwhen extended to inflnity in either direction. Such lines are termed parallel\nlines. E.g. the tracks of a straight railway line are parallel lines. We wouldn\u2019t\nwant the tracks to intersect as that would be catastrophic for the train! A\nsection of the Australian National Railways Trans-Australian line is perhaps\none of the longest pairs of man-made parallel lines.\nLongest Railroad Straight (Source: www.guinnessworldrecords.com) The\nAustralian National Railways Trans-Australian line over the Nullarbor Plain,\nis478km.(297miles)deadstraight,fromMile496,betweenNurinaandLoon-\ngana, Western Australia, to Mile 793, between Ooldea and Watson, South\nAustralia.\nAtransversaloftwoormorelinesisalinethatintersectstheselines. E.g.in\nthe flgure below, AB and CD are two lines and EF is a transversal. We are\ninterested in the properties of the angles formed by these intersecting lines, so\nwe\u2019ll introduce some deflnitions for various angle pairs.\n91 F\n8\n7\nC D\n1\n2\n4\n3\nA B\n5\n6\nE\nDeflnitions:\nInteriorangles: Whentwolinesareintersectedbyatransversal,theangles\n\u2020\nthat lie between the two lines are called interior angles. E.g. in the flgure\nabove, 1, 2, 3 and 4 are interior angles.\nExteriorangles: Whentwolinesareintersectedbyatransversal,theangles\n\u2020\nformed that lie outside the two lines are called exterior angles. E.g. 5, 6,\n7 and 8 are exterior angles.\nAlternateinteriorangles: Whentwolinesareintersectedbyatransversal,\n\u2020\nthe interior angles that lie on opposite sides of the transversal are termed\nalternateinteriorangles. E.g.intheaboveexample,1and3areareapair\nof alternate interior angles. 2 and 4 are also alternate interior angles.\nInterior angles on the same side: As the name suggests, these are interior\n\u2020\nangles that lie on the same side of the transversal. E.g. (1,4) and (2,3).\nCorresponding angles: The angles on the same side of the transversal and\n\u2020\nthe same side of the two lines are called corresponding angles. E.g. (1;5),\n(4;8) and (3;7), etc. , are pairs of corresponding angles.\nIn order to prove relationships between the angles deflned above, we will\nassume the following postulate regarding parallel lines.\nEuclid\u2019s Parallel Line Postulate:\nPostulate: If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the two\ninterior angles on the same side less than two right angles (180 ), the two\n\u2013\nstraight lines, if produced indeflnitely, meet on that side on which the\nangles are less than two right angles.\nThe above is one of the fundamental postulates of Euclidean geometry\nand has no proof based on the other postulates. Now we\u2019ll use the above\npostulate to prove some other properties.\nTheorem 1: Iftwoparallellinesareintersectedbyatransversal,thesum\nof interior angles on the same side of the transversal is two right angles\n(180 ).\n\u2013\nProof: Consider parallel lines AB and CD intersected by the transversal\nEF in the flgure above. Suppose that the sum of the interior angles is less\nthan 180 on one side of the transveral, e.g. 1+4<180 . Then Euclid\u2019s\n\u2013 \u2013\n92 Parallel Line Postulate implies that the AB and CD meet on that side of\nthetransversalandarenotparallel. Thiscontradictstheassumptionthat\nthe lines are parallel.\nNow suppose that the sum of the interior angles 1 and 4 is greater than\n180 . Now,(2)=180 (1)and(3)=180 (4). So(2+3)=360 (1+4).\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nSince (1+4) > 180 , (2+3) < 180 . Thus the parallel line postulate\n\u2013 \u2013\nimplies that the lines will meet on that side of the transveral and are not\nparallel. Thus both pairs of interior angles on the same side need to sum\nup to 180 for the lines to be parallel.\n\u2013\nTheorem 2: If two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, the\nalternate interior angles are equal.\nProof: In the flgure above, using Theorem 1,\n(1+4)=180\n\u2013\nAlso, since AB is a straight line, 1 and 4 are supplementary.\n(4+3)=180\n\u2013\nThus, 1=3. Similarly, 2=4.\nTheorem 3: If two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, the\ncorresponding angles are equal.\nProof: Again using Theorem 1, in the flgure above,\n(1+4)=180\n\u2013\nAlso, since EF is a straight line,\n(4+5)=180\n\u2013\nSo 1=5, etc.\nTheorem 4: The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180.\nProof: Consider triangle ABC shown in the flgure below. The three\nangles are denoted 1, 2 and 3. We have to show that 1+2+3 = 180 .\n\u2013\nConsider a straight line DE through point A that is parallel to BC. We\ndenote the angles between DE and the sides of the triangle as 4 and 5.\nA\nD E\n4\n5\n1\n3\n2\nB C\nSince DE is a straight line, 1+4+5=180 .\n\u2013\nNow DE is parallel to BC, and 2 and 4 are alternate interior angles (AB\nis the transversal). So 2=4. Similarly, 3=5.\nSo substituting these in the flrst equation, 1+2+3=180 .\n\u2013\nThe following theorems help in determining when two lines are parallel\nto each other.\nTheorem 5: If two lines are intersected by a transversal such that any\npair of interior angles on the same side is supplementary, then the two\n93 lines are parallel.\nProof: We\u2019llprovethatiftwolinesarenotparallel,theinteriorangleson\nthe same side are not supplementary. We\u2019ll prove this by contradiction.\nAssumethattwonon-paralleldistinctlinesareintersectedbyatransversal\nsuch that interior angles 1 and 4 are supplementary.\n1+4=180 (Eq. (i))\n\u2013\nSince the lines are not parallel, they have to intersect at some point Z.\nSince the two lines are distinct, they have to form a non-zero angle at\ntheir point of intersection.\nX\n1\nZ 9\n4\nY\nXYZ is a triangle. So 1+4+9=180 , using Theorem 4.\n\u2013\nBut using Eq. (i), 1+4 = 180 , so 9 = 0 . This contradicts the fact\n\u2013 \u2013\nthat distinct intersecting lines create a non-zero angle at their point of\nintersection.

There are, in fact, many difierent ways\nof measuring angles. The two most commonly used are degrees (the one\nyou have been using up to now) and radians.\narc\nl\ne\nn\ng\nt\nh\nA diu s\nr a\nThe radian measure of an angle is deflned as the ratio of the arc length\nsubtending the angle to the radius of the circle.\narclength\nA= (7.1)\nradius\nWe know from geometry that the circumference of a circle is found using\nthe equation c = 2\u2026r. If we divide through by the radius of the circle, r,\nwe flnd that the radian angle subtended by the complete circumference,\n(orinotherwordsthenumberofradiansinafullcircle)is 2\u2026r =2\u2026. This\nr\nmeans that 2\u2026 radians is the same as 360 .\n\u2013\nWith this in mind we can easily work out how to convert between degrees\nand radians.\nDeflnition: (cid:181)(rad)=(cid:181)( ) 2\u2026 or (cid:181)( )=(cid:181)(rad) 360\n\u2013 \u00a3 360 \u2013 \u00a3 2\u2026\nUsingtheseformulaewecanexpresscommonanglesinradians.

The answer is that\nit doesn\u2019t have one. This is because a radian is the ratio of two lengths:\nthe arc length divided by the radius. Now, both of these will have the\n1There are 360 degrees in a circle because the ancient Babylonians had a number system\nwithbase60. Abaseisthenumberyoucountuptobeforeyougetanextradigit.

This is\nwhat is known as a dimensionless quantity. Sometimes we write radians\n(or simply rad) after the number to emphasise that we are using radians,\nbut this is not necessary.\nIn general, if an angle is expressed in terms of \u2026 it is meant to be in ra-\ndians.

These functions,\nknown as trigonometric functions, relate the lengths of the sides of a tri-\nangle to its interior angles.\nHow to remember the deflnitions\nDifierentpeoplehavedifierentwaysofrememberingtheseratios. Oneway\ninvolves deflning opposite to be side of the triangle opposite to the angle,\nhypotenuse to be the side opposite to the right-angle (just like we use the\nterm in geometry) and adjacent to be the side next to the angle, which is\nnot the hypotenuse. This is illustrated in the following picture, where we\n98 show the adjacent, opposite and hypotenuse for the angle (cid:181).\ne\nus etisoppo\nn\ne\not\np\ny\nh\n(cid:181)\nadjacent\nSo, using these deflnitions we have:\nopposite\nsin(cid:181) = (7.5)\nhypotenuse\nadjacent\ncos(cid:181) = (7.6)\nhypotenuse\nopposite\ntan(cid:181) = (7.7)\nadjacent\nThere is a mnemonic to remember these:\nS Sine\nO Opposite\nH Hypotenuse\nC Cos\nA Adjacent\nH Hypotenuse\nT Tan\nO Opposite\nA Adjacent\nAnother mnemonic that is perhaps easier to remember goes as follows:\nOpposite\nSilly Old Hens Sin=\nHypotenuse\nAdjacent\nCackle And Howl Cos=\nHypotenuse\nOpposite\nTill Old Age Tan=\nAdjacent\nCAUTION! The deflnitions of opposite, adjacent and hypotenuse only\nmake sense when you are working with right-angled triangles! Always\ncheck to make sure your triangle has a right angle before you use them,\notherwise you will get the wrong answer. We will flnd ways of working\nwith the trigonometry of non right-angled triangles later in the chapter.\nBy using the appropriate triangles it is possible to work out the following\nvalues of the sine, cosine and tangent functions for a number of common\nangles.\n99 0 30 45 60 90 180\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\ncos(cid:181) 1 p3 1 1 0 1\n2 p2 2 \u00a1\nsin(cid:181) 0 1 1 p3 1 0\n2 p2 2\ntan(cid:181) 0 1 1 p3 0\np3 \u00a1\nThese values are useful to remember as they often occur in questions.\nThey are also a good way of helping us to visualise the graphs of the sine,\ncosine and tangent functions.\n7.3.2 Trigonometric Graphs\nSine and Cosine Graphs\nLet us look back at our values for sin(cid:181) {\n0 30 45 60 90 180\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nsin(cid:181) 0 1 1 p3 1 0\n2 p2 2\nAs you can see, the function sin(cid:181) has a value of 0 at (cid:181) = 0 . Its value\n\u2013\nthen smoothly increases until (cid:181) =90 when its value is 1. We then know\n\u2013\nthat it later decreases to 0 when (cid:181) = 180 . Putting all this together we\n\u2013\ncan start to picture the full extent of the sine graph. The sine graph is\nshown in flgure 7.1.\n1\n360 180 180 360\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n1\n\u00a1\nFigure 7.1: The sine graph.\nLet us now look back at the values of cosine{\n0 30 45 60 90 180\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\ncos(cid:181) 1 p3 1 1 0 1\n2 p2 2 \u00a1\nIf you look carefully you will notice that the cosine of an angle (cid:181) is the\nsame as the sine of the angle 90 (cid:181). Take for example,\n\u2013\n\u00a1\n1\ncos60 = =sin30 =sin(90 60 )\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n2 \u00a1\n100 This tells us that in order to create the cosine graph all we need to do\nis to shift the sine graph 90 to the left2.

Let us look back at our deflnitions of sin(cid:181)\nand cos(cid:181) in a right angled triangle.\nopposite\nsin(cid:181) opposite\nhypotenuse\n= = =tan(cid:181)\ncos(cid:181) adjacent adjacent\nhypotenuse\nThis is the flrst of an important set of equations called trigonometric\nidentities. Anidentityisanequationwhichholdstrueforanyvaluewhich\nis put into it. In this case we have shown that\nsin(cid:181)\ntan(cid:181) =\ncos(cid:181)\nfor any value of (cid:181).\nSo we know that for values of (cid:181) for which sin(cid:181) = 0, we must also have\ntan(cid:181) = 0. Also, if cos(cid:181) = 0 our value of tan(cid:181) = 0 is undeflned as we\ncannot divide by 0. The complete graph3 is shown in flgure 7.3.\n2You may have noticed that the transformation we are using is in fact a translation of\n90\u2013 followed by a re(cid:176)ection in the y axis due to a negative sign in front of the (cid:181). However,\nbecause cosine is an even function (i.e. symmetric about the y axis) this re(cid:176)ection doesn\u2019t\nreallymatter!\n3Thedottedlinesinthetangentgraphareknownasasymptotesandthegraphissaidto\ndisplayasymptoticbehaviour.

We shall deflne them as follows{\n1 hypotenuse\ncsc(cid:181) = = (7.8)\nsin(cid:181) opposite\n1 hypotenuse\nsec(cid:181) = = (7.9)\ncos(cid:181) adjacent\n1 adjacent\ncot(cid:181) = = (7.10)\ntan(cid:181) opposite\nThe graphs of these functions are shown in flgures 7.4{7.6. There are a\nnumber of points worth noting about these graphs. Firstly, since sin(cid:181)\nj j\nand cos(cid:181) are always less than or equal to 1 their reciprocal functions\nj j\ncsc(cid:181) and sec(cid:181) must always be greater than or equal to 1. Secondly\nj j j j\nnotice that the sectant graph can be obtained from the cosecant graph by\nperforming a 90 shift, just like we did with sine and cosine. Notice also\n\u2013\nthat these graphs have asymptotes whenever their reciprocal function is\n0.\nOneimportantfeatureofallthesetrigonometricfunctionsisthattheyare\nperiodic with a period of 360 . This is most easily understood by looking\n\u2013\nback at a circle.\n102 5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n360 180 1 180 360\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n2\n\u00a1\n3\n\u00a1\n4\n\u00a1\n5\n\u00a1\nFigure 7.4: The cosecant graph.\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n360 180 1 180 360\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n2\n\u00a1\n3\n\u00a1\n4\n\u00a1\n5\n\u00a1\nFigure 7.5: The sectant graph.\n103 4\n2\n360 180 180 360\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n2\n\u00a1\n4\n\u00a1\nFigure 7.6: The cotangent graph.\n(cid:181)\nImagine that we are measuring the angle (cid:181) on this circle. Now let us add\n360 to our angle so that our line sweeps all the way around the circle\n\u2013\nand ends up back where it started as indicated in the diagram. There is\nno way of knowing whether we have swept around the circle in this way\nas everything ends up exactly where it started.

These func-\ntions take in ratios (such as opposite in the case of inverse sine) and give\nhypotenuse\nout the angle it corresponds to. However, due to the periodicity of the\n104 trigonometric functions there are many possible angles for one ratio. For\nexample,bothsin30 andsin150 givevaluesof 1 sosin\u00a11 1 canbeeither\n\u2013 \u2013 2 2\n30 , 150 or any one of an inflnite amount of other possibilities.\n\u2013 \u2013\nTwo notations are commonly used for the inverse functions { sin\u00a11(cid:181) and\narcsin(cid:181). Both the 1 and arc versions can be used for any of the six\n\u00a1\ntrigonometric functions. However, you must be careful not to confuse the\nreciprocal functions (csc, sec and cot) with the inverse functions (arcsin,\narccos and arctan). They are difierent functions with difierent meanings\nand will give difierent answers4.\n7.4 Trigonometric Rules and Identities\n7.4.1 Translation and Re(cid:176)ection\nWe found earlier that all trigonometric functions are periodic, with a pe-\nriod of 360 . We can express this more formally by writing{\n\u2013\nsin((cid:181) 360 )=sin(cid:181)\n\u2013\n\u00a7\nThis identity states that the sine of an angle is unchanged if we add or\nsubtract 360 . Another way to think of this is as a translation of the sine\n\u2013\ngraph by 360 to the right or left.\n\u2013\n360 shift\n\u2013\n1\n360 180 180 360\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n1\n\u00a1\nAs you can see, if we shift the whole graph by 360 left or right it will\n\u2013\nend up back on top of itself. The sine of an angle is therefore completely\nunchanged. Identities of this form can be very useful. We shall consider a\nfewsuchidentities hereusingtheideasofchapter(NOTE: Addincorrect\nref for transformations in geometry chapter).\nn\nFirstletusconsiderre(cid:176)ectingthesingraphinthexandy axes. Weknow\nthat if we re(cid:176)ect in the x axis we will get the graph of sin(cid:181). Figure 7.7\n\u00a1\nshows the original sine graph (gray) and its re(cid:176)ection in the x axis. Just\nby looking at the graph we can see that re(cid:176)ecting sine in the y axis would\ngive the same result as re(cid:176)ecting in the x axis did5.

This gives us a\n\u00a1\nsecond identity{\nsin( (cid:181))= sin(cid:181)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nWe could also obtain the black function in flgure 7.7 by translating the\ngray sine graph 180 to the right or left. This tells us that{\n\u2013\nsin( (cid:181))= sin(cid:181) =sin((cid:181) 180 )\n\u2013\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a7\nLet us now look at the cosine function. Again we can use the fact that\ncosine is periodic with period 360 to give{\n\u2013\ncos((cid:181) 360 )=cos(cid:181)\n\u2013\n\u00a7\nThistimeourre(cid:176)ectionsarealittlemorecomplicated. Firstlylet\u2019sre(cid:176)ect\nthe cosine function in the y axis to generate cos( (cid:181)). Since the cosine\n\u00a1\ngraph is symmetric about the y axis the re(cid:176)ection will not change our\ngraph. This tells us that {\ncos( (cid:181))=cos(cid:181)\n\u00a1\nRe(cid:176)ecting in the x axis we obtain flgure 7.8.

We can however still consider the black graph as a translation of\n180 to the left or right. As before this gives us an identity{\n\u2013\ncos(cid:181) =cos((cid:181) 180 )\n\u2013\n\u00a1 \u00a7\nOne flnal and very important class of translation identity are those that\nconvert sine into cosine and vice versa. We have already seen one of these\nwhen we looked at the graphs of sine and cosine{\ncos(cid:181) =sin(90 (cid:181))\n\u2013\n\u00a1\nThis can be written in many ways by using the identities we have already\nproven. One more sensible version is{\ncos((cid:181) 90 )=sin(cid:181)\n\u2013\n\u00a1\nIt is now easier to see that the sine graph is just the cosine graph moved\n90 to the right. We shall prove that these two identities are the same in\n\u2013\nthe worked example at the end of this section.\nTherearemanymoreidentitiessuchastheseforsineandcosineaswellas\ntangentandthereciprocalfunctions.

This means that they are an\nenlagement (usually with a negative scale factor so that they are smaller\nthan the original) so all angles are unchanged. We can use this to make\nuse of maps and plans by adding information from the real world.\nLet us imagine that there is a coastline with two lighthouses, one either\nside of a beach. This is shown in flgure 7.10. The two lighthouses are\n0:67km apart and one is exactly due east of the other. Let us suppose\nthatnoboatmaygetcloserthat200mfromthelighthousesincaseitruns\naground.

Since we know the distance between the lighthouses and we\nhave two angles we can use trigonometry to flnd the remaining two sides\nof the triangle, the distance of the boat from the two lighthouses.\nFigure7.11showsthistrianglemoreclearly.

The\n\u2018A\u2019 in the 1st quadrant stands for all (meaning sine, cosine and tangent\nareallpositiveinthisquadrant). \u2018S\u2019,\u2018C\u2019and\u2018T\u2019,ofcourse,standforsine,\ncosine and tangent.\nThe diagram is shown in two forms. The version on the left shows the\nCAST diagram including the unit circle. This version is useful for equa-\ntions which lie in large or negative ranges. The simpler version on the\nright is useful for ranges between 0 and 360 .\n\u2013 \u2013\nMagnitude of the trigonometric functions\nNow that we know which quadrants our solutions lie in we need to know\nwhich angles in these quadrants satisfy our equation.\nCalculators give us the smallest possible answer (sometimes negative)\nwhich satisfles the equation. For example, if we wish to solve sin(cid:181) = 0:3\nwe can apply the inverse sine function to both sides of the equation to\nflnd{\n(cid:181) = arcsin0:3\n= 17:46\n\u2013\nHowever,weknowthatthisisjustoneofinflnitelymanypossibleanswers.\nWe get the rest of the answers by flnding relationships between this small\nangle, (cid:181), and answers in other quadrants.\nTo do this we need to condider the modulus7 of the sine graph.\nAs you can see in flgure 7.16 there is a solution to the equation sin(cid:181) =\nj j\n0:3ineveryquadrant. The1st quadrantsolutionisofcourse17:46 asour\n\u2013\ncalculator told us. The 2nd quadrant solution can be seen to be 180 (cid:181).\n\u2013\n\u00a1\nAnother way to see this is to look at the identity\nsin(cid:181) =sin(180 (cid:181))\n\u2013\n\u00a1\n7This means we plot only the magnitude of the function. This is the same as re(cid:176)ecting\nnegativesectionsinthexaxis.\n124 1st 2nd 3rd 4th\n1\n0.3\n0\n0 90 180 270 360\nFigure 7.16: The modulus of the sine graph.\nproved in section 7.4. Using the same logic the 3rd quadrant solution can\nbe seen to be (180 +(cid:181)) and the 4th quadrant solution (360 (cid:181)). It is\n\u2013 \u2013\n\u00a1\nnow left to the reader to show, using similar graphs for cosine and tan-\ngent, that these relationships are true for all three of the trigonometric\nfunctions.\nThese rules can be expressed in a simpler way. If we deflne the solution\nlying between 0 and 90 as `{\n\u2013 \u2013\nDeflnition:\n{ If we are in the 1st or 3rd quadrants our solution is the lower\nboundary of the quadrant plus `.\n{ If we are in the 2nd or 4th quadrants our solution is the upper\nboundary of the quadrant minus `.\n7.6.2 Solution Using Periodicity\nUp until now we have only solved trigonometric equations where the ar-\ngument (the bit after the function, e.g. the (cid:181) in cos(cid:181) or the (2x 7) in\n\u00a1\ntan(2x 7)) has been (cid:181). If there is anything more complicated than this\n\u00a1\nwe need to be a little more careful.\nLetustrytosolvetan(2x)=2:5intherange0 x 360 .

Ourcalulatortellsusthatarctan(2:5)=68:2 .\n\u2013\nThis is our flrst quadrant solution for 2x. Our 3rd quadrant lies between\n180 and 270 so our solution is 180 +68:2 . Putting this together{\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n2x = 68:2 or 248:2\n\u2013 \u2013\nx = 34:1 or 124:1\n\u2013 \u2013\n)\n125 Notice that we did not divide by the 2 until we had found our answers.\nNowtrytoputx=214:1intotheequation. Thisgives2x=428:2andwe\nflnd that tan(428:2)=2:5! This solution, x=214:1, lies within the range\n0 x 360 so we should have included it in our answer. Why did we\n\u2013 \u2013\n\u2022 \u2022\nnot flnd this solution before?\nThe answer is that when we halved our solutions for 2x to flnd x we also\nhalved our range. We looked for solutions for 0 2x 360 so, after\n\u2013 \u2013\n\u2022 \u2022\nhalving, our flnal answer gave us solutions in the range 0 x 180 .\n\u2013 \u2013\n\u2022 \u2022\nThere are two ways of dealing with this. We could redo the problem\nlooking the the range 0 2x 720 . This will work but there is a\n\u2013 \u2013\n\u2022 \u2022\nsimpler method.\nWe know that all the trigonometric functions are periodic with a period\nof 360 . This means we can add (or subtract) a factor of 360n (where n\n\u2013 \u2013\nis an integer) our solution to flnd another equally valid solution. Let us\ntry this with tan(2x)=2:5. If n=0 we regain our original answers{\n2x=68:2 or 248:2\n\u2013 \u2013\nAdding360 (n=1)tooursolutionsfor2xweflndthenexttwosolutions{\n\u2013\n2x = 68:2 +360 or 248:2 +360\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n= 428:2 or 608:2\n\u2013 \u2013\n)\nx = 214:1 or 304:1\n\u2013 \u2013\n)\n7.6.3 Linear Triginometric Equations\nJustlikewithregularequationsolvingwithouttrigonometricfunctionsthe\nequationscanbecomealotmorecomplicated. Youshouldsolvethesejust\nlike normal equations and once you have a signal trigonometric ratio iso-\nlated, then you follow the strategy outlined in the previous section.(ADD\nAN EXAMPLE HERE)\n7.6.4 Quadratic andHigherOrder Trigonometric Equa-\ntions\nThe simplest quadratic trigonometric equation is of the form{\nsin2x 2= 1:5\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nThis type of equation can be easily solved by rearranging to get a more\nfamiliar linear equation{\nsin2x = 0:5 (7.74)\nsinx = p0:5 (7.75)\n) \u00a7\nThis gives two linear trigonometric equations. The solutions to either of\nthese equations will satisfy the original quadratic. (ADD AN EXAMPLE\nHERE)\nThe next level of complexity comes when you need to solve a trinomial\n126 which contains trig functions. Here you can make you life a lot easier if\nyou use temporary variables. Consider solving{\ntan2(2x+1)+3tan(2x+1)+2=0\nHereyoushouldnoticethattan(2x+1)occurstwiceintheequation,hence\nwe let y =tan(2x+1) and rewrite:\ny2+3y+2=0\nThat should look rather more familiar so that you can immediately write\ndown the factorised form and the solutions:\n(y+1)(y+2)=0\ny = 1 OR y = 2\n) \u00a1 \u00a1\nNext one just substitutes back for the temporary variable:\ntan(2x+1)= 1 or tan(2x+1)= 2\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nAnd then we are left with two linear trigonometric equations. Be care-\nful: sometimes one of the two solutions will be outside the range of the\ntrigonometric function. In that case you need to discard that solution.\nFor example sonsicer the same equation with cosines instead of tangents{\ncos2(2x+1)+3cos(2x+1)+2=0\nUsing the same method we flnd that{\ncos(2x+1)= 1 or cos(2x+1)= 2\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nThe second solution cannot be valid as cosine must lie between 1 and\n\u00a1\n1. We must, therefore, reject the second equation. Only solutions to the\nflrst equation will be valid.\n7.6.5 More Complex Trigonometric Equations\nHere are two examples on the level of the hardest trig equations you are\nlikelytoencounter. Theyrequireusingeverythingthatyouhavelearntin\nthis chapter.

He picked up your test\nresults from the Biology class and now he refuses to tell what you scored,\nor what he scored! Obviously you are trying everything to get him to tell\nyou, and he decides to tease you and makes you work it out for yourself.\nHe says the following:\n\\I have 2 marks more than you and the sum of both our marks is equal\nto 14. How much did we get?\"\nNow if the numbers are simple like in the example, you might be able\nto work it out in your head. Can you? But to make it easier, you can use\na linear equation!\nThis is how it works:\nWe use a placeholder for your amount and that placeholder is x. So:\nYou=x\nThen we need a placeholder for Joseph\nJoseph=y\nBUT the trick is that we have some information about Joseph\u2019s mark,\nwhich is that Joseph has 2 more than you. We need to use that, so how\n130 about:\nJoseph=you+2\nOr\nJoseph=(x+2)\nOr\ny =(x+2)\nNow we need to use the last bit of information we have and that is:\nYou+Joseph=14\nOr using placeholders\nx+y =14\nOr substituting y\nx+(x+2)=14\nWhat we have here is the actual linear equation.\nYoualreadyknowwhatanequationisbutwhatdoeslinearmean? Linear\nmeansthehighestpoweroftheunknownvariable,usuallycalledx,isone.\n8.1.2 Solving Linear equations - the basics\nTo flnd out what your test result is we need to now simplify this equation\nuntil we only have the x on the one side of the equal sign and a value on\nthe other side. There are a few rules on how to simplify these equations\nto get a value for x. They can be organized into 3 groups. Once we have\nworked through them and we are sure about them, then we can attempt\nto flnd out what the answer to our problem is. So here they are:\nRule one - Addition or subtraction\nYou are allowed to subtract or add any amount as long as you do it on\nboth sides of the equal sign:\nExample 1:\nx+5= 6 (8.1)\n\u00a1\nx+5 5= 6 5 (8.2)\n) \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nx= 11 (8.3)\n) \u00a1\n131 Example 2:\n1\nx =7 (8.4)\n\u00a1 2\n1 1 1\nx + =7+ (8.5)\n) \u00a1 2 2 2\n15\nx= (8.6)\n) 2\nRule two - Multiply or divide\nThe same principle applies for multiplication and division:\nExample 1:\n2x=9 (8.7)\n2x 9\n= (8.8)\n) 2 2\n9\nx= (8.9)\n) 2\nExample 2:\nx\n=5 (8.10)\n4\nx\n4=5 4 (8.11)\n) 4 \u00a3 \u00a3\nx=20 (8.12)\n)\nRule three - Fractions\nIf x is multiplied by a fraction we need to divide both sides of the equal\nsign with that fraction to get x alone. We do that by (cid:176)ipping the fraction\naround and then multiplying both sides with it\nExample 1:\n3\n( )x=7 (8.13)\n2\n3 2 2\n( )x( )=7( ) (8.14)\n) 2 3 3\n14\nx= (8.15)\n) 3\nThesearethebasicrulestoapplywhensimplifyingalinearequation. But\nmost linear equations will require a few combinations of these before x is\n132 sittingaloneontheonesideoftheequalsign. Thatmeanswemighthave\ntomakeuseoftherulesaboveanumberoftimesoneaftertheother. Let\u2019s\ndo a few examples where we will use multiple steps to solve the equation:\n8.1.3 Solving linear equations - Combining the basics\nin a few steps\nTIP: Start with eliminating the terms without x, that way you avoid having to calculate too many fractions\nExample 1:\n7+5x=62 (8.16)\n7+5x 7=62 7 (8.17)\n) \u00a1 \u00a1\n5x=55 (8.18)\n)\n5x 55\n= (8.19)\n) 5 5\nx=11 (8.20)\n)\nExample 2:\n3\n55=5x+ (8.21)\n4\n3 3 3\n55 =5x+ (8.22)\n) \u00a1 4 4 \u00a1 4\n1\n54( )=5x (8.23)\n) 4\n217\n=5x (8.24)\n) 4\n217 1 1\n=5x (8.25)\n) 4 \u00a3 5 \u00a3 5\nDoing that is the the same as dividing by 5\n217\n=x (8.26)\n) 20\nTIP: Start by moving all the terms with x to the one side\nand all the terms without x to the opposite side of the equal\nsign. Remember we can do that by changing the sign of the\nterm\n133 Example 3:\n5x=3x+45 (8.27)\n5x 3x=45 (8.28)\n) \u00a1\n2x=45 (8.29)\n)\n2x 45\n= (8.30)\n) 2 2\n1\nx=22 (8.31)\n) 2\nExample 4:\n23x 12=6+2x (8.32)\n\u00a1\n23x 2x 12=6 (8.33)\n) \u00a1 \u00a1\n23x 2x=6+12 (8.34)\n) \u00a1\n21x=18 (8.35)\n)\n21\nx= (8.36)\n) 18\nExample 5:\n12 6x+34x=2x 24 64 (8.37)\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n6x+34x=2x 24 64 12 (8.38)\n) \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n6x+34x 2x= 24 64 12 (8.39)\n) \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n26x= 100 (8.40)\n) \u00a1\n100\nx= (8.41)\n) \u00a1 26\n50\nx= (8.42)\n) \u00a113\nWe simplifled the answer - but this is not necessarily a required step\nTIP: If there are parentheses (brackets) in the equation, start by removing them - multiply with the coe\u2013cient\nExample 6:\n3(3x 4)=8 (8.43)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n9x+12=8 (8.44)\n) \u00a1\n9x=8 12 (8.45)\n) \u00a1 \u00a1\n9x= 4 (8.46)\n) \u00a1 \u00a1\n4\nx= (8.47)\n) 9\nsee the term is now positive - do you remember why?\n134 Example 7:\n6x+3x=4 5(2x 3) (8.48)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nlets start with the parentheses - don\u2019t forget the minus!\n6x+3x=4 10x+15 (8.49)\n) \u00a1\nnext we move the like terms to their own sides\n6x+3x+10x=4+15 (8.50)\n)\n19x=19 (8.51)\n)\nx=1 (8.52)\n)\nExample 8:\n8(3x 14) 34=2(4x 22) 5(3+2x) (8.53)\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nLooks like a big one? Lets take it step by step\n24x 112 34=8x 44 15 10x (8.54)\n) \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nthat\u2019s all the brackets gone\n24x 112 34 8x+10x= 44 15 (8.55)\n) \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n24x 8x+10x= 44 15+112+34 (8.56)\n) \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nand now solve!\n26x=87 (8.57)\n)\n87\nx= (8.58)\n) 26\nAndthatisitforourexamples.

This means that y is minimum (if a0) or\nmaximum (if a < 0) when x = p and y = q. This point (p;q) is therefore\ncalled the turning point.\nNow notice that the quadratic function is symmetric about x = p. In\nother words f(p+v) = f(p v) = av2+q for any real number v.

For\nnow just check that this is true by multiplying out the brackets.\nThus the graph of the quadratic function f(x)= x2+6x 5 is\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n8.2.3 What is a Quadratic Equation?\nAn equation of the form ax2+bx+c = 0 is called a quadratic equation.\nSolving this equation for x is the same as flnding the roots (x-intercepts)\nof the quadratic function f(x)=ax2+bx+c.\n139 4 (cid:30)\n3\n2\n1\nx x\n1 2\n(cid:30) (cid:30)\n1 2 3 4 5\nFigure 8.3: Graph of TODO (NOTE: original BMP (qf-eg2.bmp) missing, i\nmade this up on the (cid:176)y)\n8.2.4 Factorisation\nWe have already seen examples of solving for the roots of a quadratic\nfunction by writing this function as the multiple of two brackets. For\nexample, x2 x 6 = (x+2)(x 3) = 0 means that either x = 2 or\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nx=3. This is called factorising the quadratic function.\nKnowing how to factorise a quadratic takes some practice, but here some\ngeneral ideas which are useful.\n{ First divide the entire equation by any common factor of the coe\u2013-\ncients,soastoobtainanequationoftheformax2+bx+c=0where\na, b and c have no common factors. For example, 2x2+4x+2 = 0\ncan be written as x2+2x+1=0 by dividing by 2.\n{ Now, if ax2 +bx+c = (rx+s)(ux+v), then sv = c and ru = a.\nTherefore, by flnding all the factors of a and c, one can try all the\ncombinationsandseeifthereisonewhichgivesthecorrectresultfor\nb=su+rv.\n{ Once writing the equation in the form (rx+s)(ux+v)=0, it then\nfollows that the two solutions are x= s and x= u.\n\u00a1r \u00a1v\nWorked Examples:\nExample 1: Q: Solve the equation x2+3x 4.\n\u00a1\nA: Since a=1, if this equation can be factorised, it must have the form\nx2+3x 4=(x+s)(x+v)=x2+(s+v)x+sv (8.87)\n\u00a1\nNow, as sv = 4, we know that s= 2, v =2 or s= 1, v =4 or s=1,\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nv = 4 (excluding the options which just involve interchanging s and v,\n\u00a1\nwhich makes no difierence to the flnal answer).\n140 Also s+v =3, so s= 1 and v =4 is the correct combination. Thus the\n\u00a1\nquadratic equation can be written as\nx2+3x 4=(x 1)(x+4)=0 (8.88)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nTherefore the solutions are x = 1 and x = 4. Example 2: Q: Find\n\u00a1\nthe roots of the quadratic function f(x)= 2x2+4x 2.\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nA: Wemustflndthesolutionstotheequationf(x)= 2x2+4x 2=0.\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nFirst we divide both sides of the equation be a factor of 2. This gives\n\u00a1\nthe equation\nx2 2x+1=0 (8.89)\n\u00a1\nNow, let us assume that\nx2 2x+1=(x+s)(x+v)=x2+(s+v)x+sv (8.90)\n\u00a1\nThen sv = 1 and therefore either s = v = 1 or s = v = 1. Since\n\u00a1\ns+v = 2, it follows that s=v = 1 and thus\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nx2 2x+1=(x 1)(x 1)=(x 1)2 =0 (8.91)\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nTheonlysolutionisthereforex=1. Example 3: Q: Solvetheequation\n2x2 5x 12=0.\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nA: This equation has no common factors, but still has a=2. Therefore,\nwe must look for a factorisation in the form\n2x2 5x 12=(2x+s)(x+v)=2x2+(s+2v)x+sv (8.92)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nWe see that sv = 12 and s+2v = 5. All the options for s and v are\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nconsidered below. Note: Since we now have the factor of 2x in the flrst\ns v s+2v\n2 -6 -10\n-2 6 10\n3 -4 -5\n-3 4 5\n4 -3 -2\n-4 3 2\n6 -2 2\n-6 2 -2\nbracket, it does make a difierence, in this case, whether we interchange\nthe s and v values. For example, s = 2, v = 6 and s = 6, v = 2 give\n\u00a1 \u00a1\ndifierent solutions. We must therefore consider both options.\nWe can see that the combination s = 3 and v = 4 gives s+2v = 5.\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nTherefore one can check that\n2x2 5x+12=(2x+3)(x 4)=0 (8.93)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nTherefore the solutions are x= 3 and x=4.\n\u00a12\n141 8.2.5 Completing the Square\nIt is not always possible to factorize a quadratic function. We shall now\nderive a general formula, which gives the solutions to any quadratic equa-\ntion.\nConsider a general quadratic equation ax2+bx+c=0.\nb2\nAdding and subtracting from the left-hand side does not change the\n4a\nequation. Thus\nb2 b2\nax2+bx+ +c=0 (8.94)\n4a \u00a1 4a\nTaking out a factor of a from the 1st 3 terms gives\nb b2 b2\na(x2+ + ) +c=0 (8.95)\na 4a2 \u00a1 4a\nb b b2\na(x2+ +( )2)= c (8.96)\n) a 2a 4a \u00a1\nWe can now see that the term in brackets is the perfect square (x+ b )2\n2a\nand therefore\nb b2\na(x+ )2 = c (8.97)\n2a 4a \u00a1\nNow dividing by a and taking the square root of either side gives the\nexpression\nb b2 c\nx+ = (8.98)\n2a \u00a7r4a2 \u00a1 a\nFinally, solving for x implies that\nb b2 c b b2 4ac\nx= = \u00a1 (8.99)\n\u00a12a \u00a7r4a2 \u00a1 a \u00a12a \u00a7r 4a2\nand taking the square root of 4a2 to obtain 2a gives\nb pb2 4ac\nx= \u00a1 \u00a7 \u00a1 (8.100)\n2a\nThese are the solutions to the quadratic equation. Notice that there are\ntwo solutions in general, but these may not always exists (depending on\nthe sign of the expression b2 4ac under the square root).\n\u00a1\nWorked Examples:\nExample 1:\nQ: Solve for the roots of the function f(x)=2x2+3x 7.\n\u00a1\nA: One should flrst try to factorise this expression, but in this case it\nturns out that this is not possible. Therefore we must make use of the\ngeneral formula as follows:\n142 b pb2 4ac\nx = \u00a1 \u00a7 \u00a1 (8.101)\n2a\n(3) (3)2 4(2)( 7)\n= \u00a1 \u00a7 \u00a1 \u00a1 (8.102)\np 2(2)\n3 p56\n= \u00a1 \u00a7 (8.103)\n4\n3 2p14\n= \u00a1 \u00a7 (8.104)\n4\nTherefore the two roots of the quadratic function are x = 3+2p14 and\n\u00a1 4\n3 2p14.\n\u00a1 \u00a14\nExample 2:\nQ: Solve for the solutions to the quadratic equation x2 5x+8.\n\u00a1\nA: Againitisnotpossibletofactorisethisequation. Thegeneralformula\nshows that\nb pb2 4ac\nx = \u00a1 \u00a7 \u00a1 (8.105)\n2a\n( 5) ( 5)2 4(1)(8)\n= \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a7 \u00a1 \u00a1 (8.106)\np2(1)\n5 p 7\n= \u00a7 \u00a1 (8.107)\n2\n(8.108)\nSince the expression under the square root is negative these are not real\nsolutions(p 7isnotarealnumber). Thereforetherearenorealsolutions\n\u00a1\nto the quadratic equation x2 5x+8. This means that the quadratic\n\u00a1\nfunction f(x) = x2 5x+8 has no x-intercepts, but the entire function\n\u00a1\nlies above the x-axis.\nNote to self: maybe add quadratic example about distance, velocity and\nacceleration ... object falling under action of gravity (giving formula for\ndistance as a function of time)?.\n8.2.6 Theory of Quadratic Equations\nWhat is the Discriminant of a Quadratic Equation?\nConsider a general quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax2 +bx+c.\nThe discriminant is deflned as \u00a2=b2 4ac. This is the expression under\n\u00a1\nthe square root in the formula for the roots of this function. We have\nalready seen that whether the roots exist or not depends on whether this\nfactor \u00a2 is negative or positive.\n143 The Nature of the Roots\nReal Roots:\nConsider \u00a2 0 for some quadratic function f(x)=ax2+bx+c. In this\n\u201a\ncase there are solutions to the equation f(x)=0 given by the formula\nb pb2 4ac b p\u00a2\nx= \u00a1 \u00a7 \u00a1 = \u00a1 \u00a7 (8.109)\n2a 2a\nsince the square roots exists (the expression under the square root is non-\nnegative.) These are the roots of the function f(x).\nThere are various possibilities:\nEqual Roots:\nIf \u00a2=0, then the roots are equal and, from the formula, these are given\nby\nb\nx= (8.110)\n\u00a12a\nUnequal Roots:\nThere will be 2 unequal roots if \u00a2>0. The roots of f(x) are rational if\n\u00a2isaperfectsquare(anumberwhichisthesquareofarationalnumber),\nsince, inthiscase, p\u00a2isrational. Otherwise, if\u00a2isnotaperfectsquare,\nthen the roots are irrational.\nImaginary Roots:\nIf\u00a2<0, thenthesolutiontof(x)=ax2+bx+c=0containsthesquare\nroot of a negative number and therefore there are no real solutions. We\ntherefore say that the roots of f(x) are imaginary (the function f(x) does\nnot intersect the x-axis).\nSummary of Cases:\n{ Real Roots (\u00a2 0)\n\u201a\nEqual Roots (\u00a2=0)\n\u2044\nUnequal Roots (\u00a2>0)\n\u2044\nRational Roots (\u00a2 a perfect square)\n\u00a2\nIrrational Roots (\u00a2 not a perfect square)\n\u00a2\n{ Imaginary Roots (\u00a2<0)\nNote to self: maybe add pictures showing these cases graphically?\n144 Worked Examples:\nExample 1:\nQ: Consider the function f(x) = 2x2 +5x 11.

Also, since 113 is\nnot a perfect square, the roots are irrational.\nExample 2:\nQ: Consider the quadratic function f(x)=x2+bx+(2b 5), where b is\n\u00a1\nsome constant.

We can check\nwhethertheformulaisvalidbygoingthroughtheflrstfewterms,\nandseeingwhetherthetermsinthesequencecorrespondtothe\nterms given by the formula. If we substitute n = 1 into the\nformula, we should get the flrst term of the sequence, and this\nis indeed the case: 2=2+4(1 1). If we substitute n=2, we\n\u00a1\nget the second term, namely 6. We can continue in this way,\nsubstituting n = 3, n = 4, and so on - each time we get the\nexpected value back. This means that the formula is indeed\nvalid. To calculate the thousandth term, we must substitute\n1000 into the formula.

Think carefully about what this means - S =\n1\n\u00a1\n2 means that the flrst term of the series is -2, S = 0 means\n2\n\u00a1\nthat the sum of the flrst two terms is 0. Therefore the second\nterm must be 2, since when we add 2 to -2 we get 0. S = 6\n3\nmeans that the sum of the flrst three terms of the series is 6,\nso, by similar reasoning, the third term must be 6. S = 16\n4\nmeans that the fourth term must be 10.

Plot a graph of this absolute\nj \u00a1 j\u00a1\nvalue function, showing all the intercepts, the turning point and the axis\nof symmetry.\nA: We can see that, since b=1 and c= 4, the turning point is (1; 4)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nand the axis of symmetry is x = 1. Also, because a = 2 is positive, the\nabsolute value function will be V-shaped.\nNow let us flnd the y-intercept.

Let us try to flnd\nthese intercepts, which are the x-intercepts of the two straight lines y =\n2(x 1) 4 and y =2( x+1) 4.\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\ny =2(x 1) 4=0 (10.106)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n2x 6=0 (10.107)\n) \u00a1\n2x=6 (10.108)\n)\nx=3 (10.109)\n)\n(10.110)\nand\n182 y =2( x+1) 4=0 (10.111)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n2x 2=0 (10.112)\n) \u00a1 \u00a1\n2x=2 (10.113)\n) \u00a1\nx= 1 (10.114)\n) \u00a1\n(10.115)\nTherefore the graph of the absolute values function is as follows:\n6\n4\n2\n- -\n3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n2 -\n\u00a1\n4 -\n\u00a1\nFigure 10.16: Graph of the absolute values function y =2x 1 4\nj \u00a1 j\u00a1\nExample 2:\nQ: Plotagraphofthefunctionf(x)= x+3 1showingtheintercepts,\n\u00a1j j\u00a1\nturning point and axis of symmetry.\nA: The turning point is of this function is ( 3; 1) and the axis of\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nsymmetry is given by x= 3. As a= 1 is negative the graph is shaped\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nlike an upside down V.\nAt x=0, the y-intercept is\nf(0)= (0)+3 1= 3 1= 3 1= 4 (10.116)\n\u00a1j j\u00a1 \u00a1j j\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nNow this function points downwards and obtains its maximum at the\nturning point ( 3; 1). This point is below the x-axis (since y = 1 is\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nnegative). Since the function is never greater than -1, it cannot become\npositive and therefore cannot cross the x-axis. Thus this absolute value\nfunction has no x-intercepts.\nThe graph of the function is shown below.\n183 5 4 3 2 1\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\n1 .\n\u00a1\n2\n\u00a1\n3\n\u00a1\n4 .\n\u00a1\nFigure 10.17: Graph of the function f(x)= x+3 1\n\u00a1j j\u00a1\nWorked Example:\nQ: What the does the relation x2 2x+y2+4y = 4 describe? Plot a\n\u00a1 \u00a1\ngraph of this relation.\nA: We can see that it is not going to be easy to solve to x and y, but let\nus try another trick, which is to write the relation as the sum of perfect\nsquares. We know that\nx2 2x=(x2 2x+1) 1=(x 1)2 1 (10.117)\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nand also that\ny2+4y =(y2+4y+4) 4=(y+2)2 4 (10.118)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\nTherefore the relation can be written as follows:\n(x 1)2 1+(y+2)2 4= 4 (10.119)\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nand thus\n(x 1)2+(y+2)2 =1 (10.120)\n\u00a1\nBut this is just the equation for a circle centered at the origin with radius\n1 (x2 +y2 = 1), where x and y have been replaced by x 1 and y+2.\n\u00a1\nSo we can see that this is a circle which has been moved 1 to the right\nand 2 downwards. Therefore this relation describes a circle centered at\nthe point (1,-2) with radius 1 (as shown in the diagram below).\nNote: In general, the equation for a circle of radius r centered at the\npoint (a;b) is\n(x a)2+(y b)2 =r2 (10.121)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\n184 1 2\n1\n\u00a1\n(1; 2)\n2 \u00a1 /\n\u00a1\n3\n\u00a1\nFigure 10.18: Graph of the circle (x 1)2+(y+2)2 =1\n\u00a1\nWorked Example:\nQ: Show that the equation for an ellipse centered at the origin can be\nderived from that of a circle centered at the origin by performing suitable\ntransformations.

What is the equation\nfor the function which can be obtained by stretching f(x) vertically by a\nfactor of a, then shifting this function to the right by p and upwards by\nq?\nA: We start with the function y =x2 and must be very careful to apply\nthese changes in the right order. First we stretch f(x) vertically by a\nfactor of a. This means that we must change y to y, which gives\na\ny\n=x2 (10.125)\na\ny =ax2 (10.126)\n)\nNow we shift y = ax2 to the right by p. In other words, we change x to\nx p, which gives\n\u00a1\ny =a(x p)2 (10.127)\n\u00a1\nFinally we shift y =a(x p)2 upwards by q. Therefore we must replace y\n\u00a1\nby y q. This means that\n\u00a1\ny q =a(x p)2 (10.128)\n\u00a1 \u00a1\ny =a(x p)2+q (10.129)\n) \u00a1\nwhich is one way of writing the general formula for a quadratic function\n(see section 1.4).\nExample 2:\nQ: Let f(x) = x + 6. What is the function which is the result of\nre(cid:176)ecting f(x) about the y-axis and then shrinking this function by a\nfactor of 2 horizontally and then vertically? Plot graphs of the initial and\nflnal functions. There are other ways of getting this flnal function from\nf(x)byperformingonlytwochanges. Giveanexampleofsuchamethod.\nA: We start with the initial function y =x+6. If we re(cid:176)ect this about\nthe x-axis, we must change x to x and this gives\n\u00a1\ny = x+6 (10.130)\n\u00a1\nNow we must shrink this function by a factor of 2 horizontally. Thus\nchanging x to 2x result in the equation\ny = 2x+6 (10.131)\n\u00a1\nIf we now shrink this by a factor of 2 vertically (changing y to 2y) we get\n186 2y = 2x+6 (10.132)\n\u00a1\ny = x+3 (10.133)\n) \u00a1\nThe graphs of the initial function y = x+6 and the flnal function y =\nx+3 are shown below.\n\u00a1\n6 1\n4\n4 2\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\n\u00a1 1\n6 4 2\n\u00a1 \u00a1 \u00a1\nFigure10.20: Graphoftheinitialfunctiony =x+6(left)andtheflnalfunction\ny = x+3 (right)\n\u00a1\nFinally we must look for two transformations which give this same result.\nWesuspectthattheremustbeare(cid:176)ectioninvolved,becausetheflnalfunc-\ntion involves x and the initial function contains x (also the above graph\n\u00a1\nshows that the straight lines are perpendicular). Therefore, as before, we\nstart by re(cid:176)ecting the function f(x) about the y-axis. This gives\ny = x+6 (10.134)\n\u00a1\nNow we see that to get the flnal equation y = x+3 we must also add\n\u00a1\n-3 to this equation. This is the same as replacing x by x+3, so let us try\nshifting the equation by 3 to the left. This gives the equation\ny = (x+3)+6 (10.135)\n\u00a1\ny = x+3 (10.136)\n) \u00a1\nTherefore, two changes which give the same flnal function are a re(cid:176)ection\nabout the y-axis followed by a shift by 3 to left.\n187 Appendix A\nGNU Free\nDocumentation License\nVersion 1.2, November 2002\nCopyright c 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n(cid:176)\n59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\nEveryoneispermittedtocopyanddistributeverbatimcopiesofthislicense\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\nPREAMBLE\nThepurposeofthisLicenseistomakeamanual, textbook, orotherfunc-\ntional and useful document \\free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure ev-\neryone the efiective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\nmodifying it, either commercially or non-commercially.
