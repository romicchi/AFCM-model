Chapter 7: Rational and Irrational Numbers (3\nweeks)\nUtah Core Standard(s):\n\uf0b7 Use square root and cube root symbols to represent solutions to equations of the form \ud835\udc652 = \ud835\udc5d and \ud835\udc653 =\n\ud835\udc5d, where p is a positive rational number. Evaluate square roots of small perfect squares and cube roots of\nsmall perfect cubes. Know that \u221a2 is irrational. (8.EE.2)\n\uf0b7 Know that numbers that are not rational are called irrational. Understand informally that every number\nhas a decimal expansion; for rational numbers, show that the decimal expansion repeats eventually, and\nconvert a decimal expansion which repeats eventually into a rational number. (8.NS.1)\n\uf0b7 Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the size of irrational numbers, locate them\napproximately on a number line diagram, and estimate the value of expressions (e.g.,\ud835\udf0b2). For example,\nby truncating the decimal expansion of \u221a2, show that \u221a2, is between 1 and 2, then between 1.4 and 1.5,\nand explain how to continue on to get better approximations. (8.NS.2)\nAcademic Vocabulary: square, perfect square, square root, \u221a , cube, perfect cube, cube root, 3 \u221a , quadratic\nequation, cubic equation, inverse operation, decimal expansion, repeating decimal, terminating decimal, rational\nnumber, irrational number, truncate, decimal approximation, real number, real number line\nChapter Overview:\nIn 8th grade, students begin to think more carefully about the real line by asking the question, \u201cIs there a\nnumber associated with every point on the line?\u201d Up to this point, students have worked only with rational\nnumbers, numbers they generated from iterations of a whole unit or portions of whole units. Part of their work\nincluded identifying a point on the real line associated with each rational number. Students explore the question\nposed above through an activity that has them constructing the lengths of non-perfect squares, thus introducing\nstudents to irrational numbers.\nThe chapter starts by having students examine the relationship between the area of a square and its side\nlength. This activity introduces students to the idea of what it means to take the square root of a number.\nAdditionally, students begin to surface ideas about the limitations of rational numbers. In the activity, students\nconstruct physical lengths of irrational numbers and begin to realize that we cannot find an exact numerical\nvalue for these numbers. Students then use the knowledge gained from this activity to simplify square roots and\nsolve simple quadratic and cubic equations (i.e. \ud835\udc652 = 40 and \ud835\udc653 = 64).\nIn the last section, students deepen their understanding of what an irrational number is and in the process\nsolidify their understanding of rational numbers. They realize that even though they cannot give an exact\nnumerical value for the lengths of non-perfect squares, they can transfer these lengths to a number line to show\nthe exact location of these numbers. Once the numbers are placed on the real line, students can approximate the\nvalue of these irrational numbers and compare their value to rational numbers. At the end of the chapter,\nstudents learn additional methods for approximating the value of irrational numbers to desired degrees of\naccuracy, estimate the value of expressions containing irrational numbers, and compare and order rational and\nirrational numbers.\n8WB7 - 2 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

They have defined\nand worked with the subsets of rational numbers. They have represented rational numbers on a number line,\nexpressed rational numbers in different but equivalent forms, and operated with rational numbers. Students have\nalso worked a great deal with slope, have an understanding of area, and know how to find the area of polygons\nand irregular shapes which will help them to access the tilted square material.\nFuture Knowledge: Later in this book, students will study exponent rules and deepen their understanding of the\nconnection between taking the square root of a number and squaring a number. In subsequent courses, students\nwill continue to extend their knowledge of the number system even further. For example, students will learn\nabout complex numbers as a way to solve quadratic equations that have a negative discriminant. They will also\ncontinue to work with irrational numbers, learning how to operate on irrational numbers.\n8WB7 - 3 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

MATHEMATICAL PRACTICE STANDARDS:\nA hospital has asked a medical supply company to manufacture\nintravenous tubing (IV tubing) that has a minimum opening of 7 square\nmillimeters and a maximum opening of 7.1 square millimeters for the\nrapid infusion of fluids. The medical design team concludes that the\nradius of the tube opening should be 1.5 mm. Two supervisors review\nthe design team\u2019s plans, each using a different estimation for \u03c0.\nSupervisor 1: Uses 3 as an estimation for \u03c0\nMake sense of\nproblems and Supervisor 2: Uses 3.1 as an estimation for \u03c0\npersevere in\nsolving them. The supervisors tell the design team that their designs will not work.\nThe design team stands by their plans and tells the supervisors they are\nwrong. Who is correct and why? Recall that the formula for the area of a\ncircle is \ud835\udc34 = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f2.\nIn this problem, students realize the effects of approximating the value\nof irrational numbers. They must decide which estimation of \u03c0 is\nappropriate for the given situation, appreciating that the precision of\nthe estimation may have profound impact on decisions people make in\nthe real world.\nThe decimal 0.3\u0305 is a repeating decimal that can be thought of as\n0.33333\u2026 where the \u201c\u2026\u201d indicates that the 3s repeat forever. If they\nrepeat forever, how can we write this number as a fraction? Here\u2019s a\nReason\ntrick that will eliminate our repeating 3s.\nabstractly and\nTo solve this problem, students create and solve a system of linear\nquantitatively.\nequations. The skills and knowledge they learned about systems of\nequations become an abstract tool that allows students to write\nrepeating decimals as fractions, proving that they do in fact fit the\ndefinition of a rational number.\nDirections: The table below contains statements about rational and\nirrational numbers. If the statement is true, put a check in the box. If the\nstatement is not true, write a correct statement.\n\uf0b7 You can always use a calculator to determine whether a number\nis rational or irrational by looking at its decimal expansion.\n\uf0b7 The number 0.256425642564\u2026 is rational.\nConstruct viable\n\uf0b7 You can build a perfect cube with 36 unit cubes.\narguments and\n\uf0b7 If you divide an irrational number by 2, you will still have an\ncritique the\nirrational number.\nreasoning of\nStudents must have a clear understanding of rational and irrational\nothers.\nnumbers to assess whether the statements are true or false. If the\nstatement is flawed, students must identify the flaw, and construct a\nstatement that is true. Due to the fact that there are several possible\nways to change the statements to make them true, students must\ncommunicate their statements to classmates, justify the statements, and\nquestion and respond to the statements made by others.\n8WB7 - 4 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

People often wonder how far they can see when they\u2019re at the top of the\ntallest buildings such as the Empire State Building, The Sears Tower in\nChicago, etc. The farthest distance you can see across flat land is a\nfunction of your height above the ground. If h is the height in meters of\nyour viewing place, then d, the distance in kilometers you can see, can\nbe given by this formula: \ud835\udc51 = 3.532\u221a\u210e\nModel with The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada is 555 meters tall. It is near the shore\nmathematics. of Lake Ontario, about 50 kilometers across the lake from Niagara Falls.\nYour friend states that on a clear day, one can see as far as the falls from\nthe top of the Tower. Are they correct? Explain your answer.\nThe formula shown above is a model for the relationship between the\nheight of a building and the distance one can see. Students use this\nmodel along with their knowledge of square roots to solve problems\narising in everyday life.\nDirections: Show the length of the following numbers on the number\nline below. Use the grid on the following page to construct lengths\nwhere needed and transfer those lengths onto the number line. Then\nanswer the questions that follow. Note: On the grid, a horizontal or\nvertical segment joining two dots has a length of 1. On the number line,\nthe unit length is the same as the unit length on the dot grid.\n\ud835\udc34:\u221a25 \ud835\udc35:\u221a2 \ud835\udc36:\u221a8 \ud835\udc37:2\u221a2 \ud835\udc38:\u221a5 \ud835\udc39:2\u221a5\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n1.

They can then transfer these segments to\nthe number line using patty (or tracing) paper. Once on the number\nline, students can use these tools (number line, dot paper, patty paper,\nconstructed segments) to approximate the value of given expressions\n(i.e. (2+\u221a2)).\n8WB7 - 5 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

Students\nmust have a very clear understanding of square roots, repeating\ndecimals, and irrational numbers. They must closely analyze the\ndecimal expansions (approximations) of the numbers as well as the\ncalculations given to be able to compare and order the numbers.\nSquare A shown below has an area of 8 square units. Determine the\nfollowing measures:\na. The area of one of the smaller squares that makes up\nSquare A\nb. The side length of one of the smaller squares that makes\nup Square A\nc.

Students should see this when they begin repeating the same\ncalculations over and over again and conclude they have a repeating\ndecimal.\n8WB7 - 7 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education. Licensed under Creative Commons, cc-by. 7.0 Anchor Problem: Zooming in on the Number Line\nT he problems below are a review of skills learned in 6th and 7th grade. In 6th and 7th grade, students used the\nn umber line as a model for thinking about numbers. Students learned how to partition the number line into desired lengths\nin order to associate all rational numbers to a point on the number line. In the last two problems below, students review that\nw e can associate every decimal (a number that can be represented by a fraction whose denominator is a power of\n1 0) to a point on the number line by zooming in on the number line and chopping the intervals into repeated subdivisions of\ntenths.\nIn 8th grade, the question becomes, \u201cDo all points on the real number line correspond to a rational number?\u201d The\nanswer of course is no \u2013 there are lengths that cannot be represented by fractions. These numbers are called irrational. In 8th\ngrade, students are exposed to a subset of the irrational numbers, the square roots of non-perfect squares. In the lessons that\nfollow, students will construct lengths of non-perfect squares and understand that even though we cannot give an exact\ndecimal value for these numbers, we can show the location of these numbers on the real number line by copying our\nconstructed lengths to the real number line. Students also approximate the value of irrational numbers to increasing levels of\nac curacy and show the location of their approximations on the number line, zooming in on pieces of the number line until\nth e desired level of accuracy is reached.\nS ample answers are provided.\nA nother optional activity is to have students explore an interactive number line. A zoomable number line with exploration\nactivities is available at http://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/number-line-zoom.html.\nAdditionally, there are other number line tools available for computers and tablets.\nDirections: Place the following sets of numbers on the number lines provided and label each point. You will\nneed to decide where to place 0 and the measure of the intervals for each problem.\n\ud835\udc34:3 \ud835\udc35:4 \ud835\udc36:3.5 \ud835\udc37:\u22124 \ud835\udc38:\u22125 \ud835\udc39:\u22124.5\n1 3 1\n\ud835\udc3f: \u2212 \ud835\udc40: \ud835\udc41: \u22121 \ud835\udc42: 1.75 \ud835\udc43:\u22122\n4 4 2\n1 3 1 9 10\n\ud835\udc49: \ud835\udc4a: \ud835\udc4b: \ud835\udc4c: \ud835\udc4d:\n10 10 2 10 10\n\ud835\udc3b:0.1 \ud835\udc3c: 0.2 \ud835\udc3d: 0.15 \ud835\udc3e: 0.11 \ud835\udc3f: 0.101\n8WB7 - 8 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

Many are there for discussion\npurposes.\n1. Are there other numbers you can place between 3.1 and 3.11? If yes, find a number.\nStudents really narrow in on the piece of the number line from 3.1 to 3.11. Besides 3.105 that we have\nalready graphed, we can consider 3.101, 3.102, 3.103, etc. We can also divide the interval from 3.1 to\n3.11 into thirds, quarters, etc. and name these points. There are many possible answers.\n2. Are there other numbers you can place between 3.11 and 3.111? If yes, find a number.\nMany answers, 3.1101, 3.1102, etc. Students can think about taking this tiny segment, zooming in on it,\nand dividing it into intervals.\n3. How are you coming up with the numbers? Are there others? How do you know?\nListen to student answers as to how they are coming up with numbers. The idea here is that we can\npartition intervals on the number line in any way we choose to show the location of all rational numbers.\nWe can continue this process over and over showing that the number line is a continuum of numbers and\nthat we can repeat this process of partitioning the number line an infinite number of times.\n4. Where would you put 3.1\u0305 on the number line and why?\nAt this point, students will most likely just be approximating the location of 3.1\u0305, knowing that it lies to\nthe right of 3.11. You can talk about zooming in on the piece of the number line from 3.11 to 3.12 and\nencourage students to be even more specific and see that say 3.1\u0305 will lie to the right of 3.111 but to the\nleft of 3.112. This is a good time to review the meaning of the bar to show repeating decimals. Later in\nthe chapter, students will learn how to change repeating decimals into fractions which will allow them to\nbe even more precise in their placement of repeating decimals on the number line.\n5. What can you conclude about the real number line based on this activity?\nListen to what students conclude from this activity. Some possible responses: The number line is a\ncontinuum of numbers. We can partition the number line in any way we wish to show the location of all\nrational numbers on the number line. We can partition segments on the number line an infinite number\nof times.\n8WB7 - 9 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education. Licensed under Creative Commons, cc-by. Section 7.1: Represent Numbers Geometrically\nSection Overview:\nIn this section, students are exposed to a new set of numbers, irrational numbers. This chapter starts with a\nreview of background knowledge \u2013 finding the area of polygons and irregular shapes, using ideas of slope to\ncreate segments of equal length, and reviewing the definition of a square. Then students build squares with\ndifferent areas and express the measure of the side length of these squares, gaining an understanding of what it\nmeans to take the square root of a number. Additionally, students start to surface ideas about irrational numbers.\nStudents create squares that are not perfect and realize they cannot find an exact numerical value for the side\nlength of these squares (e.g. a number that when squared results in the area of the square created). Students also\nsimplify square roots, connecting the simplified answer to a physical model. At the end of the section, students\nuse cubes and volume to gain an understanding of what is meant by the cube root of a number.\nConcepts and Skills to Master:\nBy the end of this section, students should be able to:\n1. Understand the relationship between the side length of a square and its area.\n2. Understand the relationship between the side length of a cube and its volume.\n3. Evaluate the square roots of small perfect squares and the cube roots of small perfect cubes.\n4. Simplify square and cube roots.\nIn section 1, the focus is on understanding the relationship between the side length of a square and its\narea. In the process, students construct lengths of irrational numbers and transfer these lengths to the number\nline (by putting the line segment on the number line with one point at 0). They also begin to see that we cannot\nfind an exact numerical value for these numbers. It is in section 3 that we define what an irrational number is, a\nnumber that cannot be expressed as the ratio of an integer to a natural number.\n8WB7 - 10 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

Your segments cannot be parallel to the segment given and must start and end on a dot on the\ngrid. The purpose of this activity is that students use ideas about slope in order to\nconstruct segments that are equal in length (pairs of segments also happen to\nbe perpendicular). This will help students when constructing their tilted\nsquares. This is also a preview of what is to come in chapter 9 with\nreflections and rotations. Note that, with the given conditions, every possible\nanswer has to be parallel to one of the 3 segments in red.\n2. Using the ideas from the previous problem and the one below, write down observations you have about\nthe line segments shown on the grid.\nPossible observations: They are the same length. Make the connection to slope:\nThe slope triangles that make up the segments use the same numbers (1 and 2)\nbut in some cases the 1 is the rise and the 2 is the run and in others the 2 is the\nrise and the 1 is the run. If we imagine this on the coordinate plane, some have\npositive slopes, some are negative. The segments are perpendicular in pairs.\n3.

What does it mean to simplify a square root of a non-perfect square? What\nwas the difference between the simplified version of these square roots as opposed to how they looked before\nthey were simplified?\nLet\u2019s look at some example from the previous lesson:\n\u221a8 = 2\u221a2\n\u221a18 = 3\u221a2\n\u221a32 = 4\u221a2\n\u221a40 = 2\u221a10\nWhat observations can you make about the simplified versions of these square roots non-perfect squares? List\nthem here:\nDiscuss the following with students:\nWhen we simplify a square root of a non-perfect square we factor out as many perfect squares as we can,\nwhatever is left has to stay inside the square root symbol and is called a \u201csurd\u201d which can\u2019t be simplified\nfurther. We can factor out perfect squares because when we take the square root of a perfect square we get a\nwhole number. When we try to take the square root of non-perfect square we get a decimal that goes on and on\nwithout any pattern, so instead we leave it inside to keep it simpler. If we were to just enter the square root into\nour calculator we would eventually have to round the answer we would get, which is not as accurate. These are\nthe reasons we simplify: accuracy and simplicity.\n8WB7 - 24 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

Section 7.3: Rational and Irrational Numbers\nSection Overview:\nThis section begins with a review of the different sets of rational numbers and why a need arose to distinguish\nthem. Students then explore different ways of representing rational numbers, starting with a review of how to\nchange fractions into decimals. During this process, students are reminded that the decimal expansion of all\nrational numbers either terminates or repeats eventually. From here, students review how to express terminating\ndecimals as fractions and learn how to express repeating decimals as fractions by setting up and solving a\nsystem of equations. This skill allows them to show that all decimals that either terminate or repeat can be\nwritten as a fraction and therefore fit the definition of a rational number. After this work with rational numbers,\nstudents investigate numbers whose decimal expansion does not terminate or repeat: irrational numbers. With\nthis knowledge, students classify numbers as rational and irrational. Students learn different methods for\napproximating the value of irrational numbers, zooming in to get better and better approximations of the\nnumber. They then use these approximations to estimate the value of expressions containing irrational numbers.\nLastly, students compare and order rational and irrational numbers.\nConcepts and Skills to Master:\nBy the end of this section, students should be able to:\n1. Know that real numbers that are not rational are irrational.\n2. Show that rational numbers have decimal expansions that either terminate or repeat eventually.\n3. Convert a repeating decimal into a fraction.\n4. Know that the square root of a non-perfect square is an irrational number.\n5. Understand that the decimal expansions of irrational numbers are approximations.\n6. Show the location (or approximate location) of real numbers on the real number line.\n7. Approximate the value of irrational numbers, zooming in to get better and better approximations.\n8. Estimate the value of expressions containing irrational numbers.\n9. Compare and order rational and irrational numbers.\nAn interesting fact: In case you were wondering where the term rational comes from, it comes from the word\n\u201cratio\u201d, because rational numbers are those that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. Irrational, then,\nmeans all numbers that are not rational (and therefore cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers).\n8WB7 - 43 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

On the following pages, you will review the subsets of numbers that\nare included in the set of rational numbers. The following prompts will lead you through a discussion of a\nstudent\u2019s current understanding which is that of the rational number system. Number lines are provided for you\nto show how each of these numbers can be associated to a point on the number line.\nWhole Numbers: Early on, people needed a way to count objects. We call this set of numbers the whole\nnumbers. Talk about how you can construct a number line by marking a point for 0 and then marking a second\npoint to the right of 0 that represents one unit. We can then continue this process and create segments of equal\nlength to associate every whole number to a point on the line.\nIntegers: We need a way to talk about units that are to the left of 0. For example, how can we use a number to\nrepresent a temperature of 5 degrees below 0 or that someone is in debt $25? To the set of whole numbers we\nadd the set of their opposites and call all these numbers the integers. Whole numbers and their opposites are an\nequal distance from 0. In order to show integers on the number line, we can use our unit length to mark off a\nsuccession of equally spaced points on the line that lie to the left of 0. We can now associate every integer to a\npoint on the line.\nRational Numbers: What if I have $3.25? How would I describe the portion of a pie left if it originally had 8\npieces and 4 of them had been eaten? What if I need a little more than 3 yards of fabric to make a pillow? The\nneed to describe part of a whole gave rise to the set of numbers called rational numbers. To associate each\nrational number to a point on the line, divide the unit interval into q parts. If we append p of these together, we\n\ud835\udc5d\nget to the point represented by . There are two number lines here so you can show a few different ways of\n\ud835\udc5e\npartitioning the unit interval (i.e. halves, thirds, fifths, tenths). Show positive and negative rational numbers.\nOver the years, you have expanded your knowledge of the number system, gradually incorporating the sets of\nnumbers mentioned above. These sets of numbers are all part of the rational number system.\n\ud835\udc5d\nA rational number is any number that can be expressed as a quotient of two integers\n\ud835\udc5e\nwhere q does not equal 0.\n8WB7 - 46 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

Begin to fill out the table below with different subsets, including equivalent forms, of rational numbers\nyou know about so far and give a few examples of each. You will continue to add to this list throughout this\nsection.\nAs you work through this section, help students build the list below. Some of the numbers listed will be\n1\ndifferent representations of the same value (i.e. and 0.5).\n2\nSubsets of the Rational Numbers Examples\nNatural\nWhole\nIntegers\nFractions\nTerminating Decimals\nRepeating Decimals\nPercent\nMixed numbers\n2. Change the following rational numbers into decimals without the use of a calculator.\nStudents changed fractions into decimals in 7th grade (see 7th grade, Chapter 1). The point of these problems is not to\nsee how well students know how to divide. The goal is for them to see that the decimal expansion of a fraction will\neventually either terminate or repeat. It is recommended that you do these problems as a class and without the use of\na calculator. This way students can see that there are only so many remainders you can have for a given problem and\nonce a remainder repeats itself, the quotient will start to take on a repeating pattern. They will also see that any\nfraction with a denominator whose prime factors are only 2 and 5 will always terminate. This is due to the fact that in\nour decimal system, a decimal has a denominator that (although not explicitly given) is understood to be a power of\n10.\n1 9\na. b.\n2 5\n1.8\n0.5\n8WB7 - 47 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

Before starting the problem, ask students what\nthe possible remainders are when dividing by 7.\n(0 to 6). For this problem, they may already know\nthat 0 is not a possibility based on the discussion\nabove. Therefore, we can have remainders of 1, 2,\n3, 4, 5, and 6. Once one of these reappears, our\nquotient will start repeating a pattern. Work\nthrough the problem with students so that they\ncan see this.\n3. What do you notice about the decimal expansion of any rational number? Why is this true?\nSee discussion above.\nRevisit question #1 on the previous page.

Licensed under Creative Commons, cc-by. 7.3b Class Activity: Expressing Decimals as Fractions\nAs we discovered in the previous section, when we converted fractions into decimals, the result was either a\nterminating or repeating decimal.\nIf we are given a terminating or repeating decimal, we need a method for changing them into a fraction in order\nto prove that they fit the definition of a rational number.\nIn 7th grade, you learned how to convert terminating decimals into fractions. Here are a few examples:\n3\n0.3 =\n10\n25 1\n0.25 = =\n100 4\n375 3\n0.375 = =\n1000 8\n6 3 103\n\u22122.06 = \u22122 = \u22122 = \u2212\n100 50 50\nNow you try a few\u2026\n4 \u00f722\n0.4 = \u2192\n10 5\nTo simplify these fractions, find the greatest common factor and divide both the numerator and denominator by\nthe greatest common factor.\n5 \u00f75 1\n0.05 = \u2192\n100 20\n11\n0.275 =\n40\n3\n1.003 = 1\n1000\nSo, how do we express a repeating decimal as a fraction? For example, how would you convert the repeating\ndecimal 0.4\u0305\u0305\u03055\u0305 into a fraction? Try in the space below.\n8WB7 - 50 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education. Licensed under Creative Commons, cc-by. We can use a system of two linear equations to convert a repeating decimal into a fraction. Let\u2019s look at an\nexample:\nExample 1:\nThe decimal 0.3\u0305 is a repeating decimal that can be thought of as 0.33333\u2026 where the \u201c\u2026\u201d indicates that the 3s\nrepeat forever. If they repeat forever, how can we write this number as a fraction? Here\u2019s a trick that will\neliminate our repeating 3s.\nLet a represent our number \ud835\udc4e = 0.3\u0305.\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 10 which would give us a second equation 10\ud835\udc4e = 3.3\u0305.\nNow we have the following two equations:\n10\ud835\udc4e = 3.3\u0305\n\ud835\udc4e = 0.3\u0305\nLet\u2019s expand these out:\n10\ud835\udc4e = 3.333333333333\u2026\u2026\n\ud835\udc4e = 0.333333333333\u2026\u2026\nWhat will happen if we subtract the second equation from the first? Let\u2019s try it (remembering to line up the\ndecimals):\n10\ud835\udc4e = 3.333333333333\u2026\u2026\n\u2212 \ud835\udc4e = 0.333333333333\u2026\u2026\n___________________________\n9\ud835\udc4e = 3\n3\n\ud835\udc4e = (Divide both sides by 9)\n9\n1\n\ud835\udc4e = (Simplify the fraction)\n3\nThe mathematical foundation walks through how to use substitution to solve these types of problems if you\nwant to show this method to students as well.\n8WB7 - 51 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education. Licensed under Creative Commons, cc-by. Example 2:\nThe decimal 0.5\u0305\u0305\u03054\u0305 is a repeating decimal that can be thought of as 0.54545454\u2026 where the \u201c\u2026\u201d indicates that\nthe 54 repeats forever. Let\u2019s see how to express this as a fraction.\nLet a represent our number \ud835\udc4e = 0.5\u0305\u0305\u03054\u0305.\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 100 this time which would give us a second equation 100\ud835\udc4e = 54.5\u0305\u0305\u03054\u0305.\nNow we have the following two equations:\n100\ud835\udc4e = 54.5\u0305\u0305\u03054\u0305\n\ud835\udc4e = 0.5\u0305\u0305\u03054\u0305\nAgain, let\u2019s expand these out:\n100\ud835\udc4e = 54.5454545454\u2026\u2026\n\ud835\udc4e = 0.5454545454\u2026\u2026\nNext, subtract the second equation from the first (again, remembering to line up the decimals):\n100\ud835\udc4e = 54.5454545454\u2026\u2026\n\u2212 \ud835\udc4e = 0.5454545454\u2026\u2026\n___________________________\n99\ud835\udc4e = 54\n54\n\ud835\udc4e = (Divide both sides by 99)\n99\n6\n\ud835\udc4e = (Simplify the fraction)\n11\nWhy do you think we multiplied the second example by 100 instead of 10 as we did in the first example? What\nwould have happened if we had multiplied by 10 in example 2? Try it below and see.\nYou are not creating a system that will cause the repeating part of the decimal to cancel out \u2013 see below.\n10\ud835\udc4e = 5.4545454\u2026\u2026\n\ud835\udc4e = 0.5454545454\u2026\u2026\nDiscuss how you multiply by 10\ud835\udc4e where a is the number of digits that are part of the repeating pattern.\nExample 3: Change the decimal 2.4\u0305 into a fraction\nThe decimal 2.4\u0305 is a repeating decimal that can be thought of as 2.4444444\u2026 where the \u201c\u2026\u201d indicates that the\n4s repeat forever.\nLet a represent our number \ud835\udc4e = 2.4\u0305.\n22 4\n\ud835\udc4e = or 2\n9 9\nTalk with students about how they only have to deal with changing the decimal piece to a fraction and then they\ncan tack the whole number on \u2013 it makes the math a little easier.\n8WB7 - 52 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

Licensed under Creative Commons, cc-by. 7.3d Class Activity: Approximating the Value of Irrational Numbers\nSo far, we have seen that we can show the location of an irrational number on the number line. We also know\nthat we cannot show the entire decimal expansion of an irrational number because it is infinitely long and there\nis no pattern (as far as we know). However, we can come up with good approximations for the numerical value\nof an irrational number. It is suggested that the students don\u2019t have a calculator but the teacher does any\ncalculations for the class. Also, make sure that students understand what is happening from one number line to\nthe next. We are zooming in on a piece of the number line in order to make better approximations. In the\nprocess, the scale changes.\nThe decimal expansion for \u03c0 to eight decimal places is 3.14159265\u2026 On the number line, we know that \u03c0 lies\nsomewhere between 3 and 4:\nWe can zoom in on the interval between 3 and 4 and narrow in on where \u03c0 lies:\nAnd if we zoom in again on the interval from 3.1 to 3.2:\nAnd again:\nWe can imagine continuing this process of zooming in on the location of \u03c0 on the number line, each time\nnarrowing its possible location by a factor of 10.\nOnce we have an approximation for an irrational number, we can approximate the value of expressions that\ncontain that number.\nFor example, suppose we were interested in the approximate value of 2\ud835\udf0b? We can use our approximations of \u03c0\nfrom above to approximate the value of 2\ud835\udf0b to different degrees of accuracy:\nBecause \ud835\udf0b is between 3 and 4, 2\ud835\udf0b is between __6___ and __8__.\nBecause \ud835\udf0b is between 3.1 and 3.2, 2\ud835\udf0b is between __6.2___ and _6.4____.\nBecause \ud835\udf0b is between 3.14 and 3.15, 2\ud835\udf0b is between __6.28___ and __6.30___.\nBecause \ud835\udf0b is between 3.141 and 3.142, 2\ud835\udf0b is between __6.282___ and _6.284____.\nCheck the value of 2\ud835\udf0b on your calculator. How are we doing with our approximations of 2\ud835\udf0b?\n8WB7 - 61 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.

We can use a method of guess and check to give us an estimate of the numerical value of an irrational number\nthat is correct up to as many decimal points as we need.\nDirections: Approximate the value of the following irrational numbers to the indicated degrees of accuracy.\nYou can use your calculator for the following questions but do not use the square root key.\n1. Between which two integers does \u221a5 lie?\nWe know that \u221a5 lies between the perfect squares \u221a4 and \u221a9 so the decimal expansion of \u221a5 lies\nbetween 2 and 3: \u221a4 \u221a5 \u221a9\n2 3\na. Which integer is it closest to? 2\nb. Show its approximate location on the number line below. When students put these numbers on the\nnumber line, make sure that they understand that they are just approximating its location but in this case,\nwe know that our point should be closer to 2. On the next number line, we are going to divide the segment\nfrom 2 to 3 into 10 equal parts so that we can zoom in further to where our point lives on the interval from\n2 to 3. As you do these problems, make sure students see that we are zooming in on the interval\nfrom 2 to 3 and that the length of our intervals change. The arrows shown below may help to\nillustrate this.\nc. Now find \u221a5 accurate to one decimal place. Show its approximate location on the number line\nbelow. Let\u2019s narrow in on our approximation. Since we know that our number is closer to 2, it makes\nsense for our initial guess to be a number less than 2.5. We may even decide to start with 2.1 as a guess.\nStudents should use a calculator to check 2.12, 2.22, 2.32, etc. Once they find the two numbers that \u221a5 lies\nbetween (2.2 and 2.3), have them approximate its location on the number line below.\nd. Now find \u221a5 accurate to two decimal places. Show its approximate location on the number line\nbelow. Repeat the process to zoom in even further. We are dividing the interval from 2.2 to 2.3 into 10\nequal parts, again narrowing in on the possible location of our point by a factor of 10. \u221a5 lies between\n2.23 and 2.24. We can continue this process until we get as close as we want in our approximation.\ne. Use your work from above to approximate the value of the expression 2+\u221a5 to the nearest\nwhole number.

Now it makes sense for our initial guess to be greater than 3.5 or\nwe may choose to start with 3.9 as a guess. Students will find that \u221a15 lies between 3.8 and 3.9.\nd.

A hospital has asked a medical supply company to manufacture intravenous tubing (IV tubing) that has a\nminimum opening of 7 square millimeters and a maximum opening of 7.1 square millimeters for the\nrapid infusion of fluids. The medical design team concludes that the radius of the tube opening should be\n1.5 mm. Two supervisors review the design team\u2019s plans, each using a different estimation for \u03c0.\nSupervisor 1: Uses 3 as an estimation for \u03c0\nSupervisor 2: Uses 3.1 as an estimation for \u03c0\nThe supervisors tell the design team that their designs will not work. The design team stands by their\nplans and tells the supervisors they are wrong. Who is correct and why? Recall that the formula for the\narea of a circle is \ud835\udc34 = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f2.\nThe point of this problem and the one that follows is to help students to see that there are times when we\ndo not need to be very precise in our approximations of irrational numbers and there are others (like the\nexample above) that we need to be very precise in our approximations of irrational numbers.\nWork with students to determine the radius that would have been calculated by each supervisor with the\napproximation they used for \u03c0. What do they think the design team used for their approximation?\n10. A square field with an area of 2,000 square ft. is to be enclosed by a fence. Three contractors are\nworking on the project and have decided to purchase slabs of pre-built fencing. The slabs come in pieces\nthat are 5-ft. long.\n\uf0b7 Keith knows that \u221a2000 is between 40 and 50. Trying to save as much money as possible, he\nestimates on the low side and concludes that they will need 160 feet of fencing. Therefore, he\nconcludes they should purchase 32 slabs of the material.\n\uf0b7 Jose also knows that \u221a2000 is between 40 and 50 but he is afraid that using Keith\u2019s calculations,\nthey will not have enough fencing. He suggests that they should estimate on the high side and\nbuy 200 feet of fencing to be safe. Therefore, he concludes they should purchase 40 slabs of\nmaterial.\nKeith and Jose begin to argue. Sam jumps in and says, \u201cI have a way to make you both happy \u2013 we will\npurchase enough material to enclose the entire field and we will minimize the amount of waste.\u201d What\ndo you think Sam\u2019s suggestion is and how many slabs will be purchased using Sam\u2019s rationale?\nThe idea here is \u2013 can we do better than the approximations made by Keith and Jose? Encourage students to try\nto get a better approximation for \u221a2000. One possible answer is 45 \u2013 this will ensure there is enough material.\nThat would mean that they would need 180 feet of fencing and therefore 36 slabs of material. Discuss why it\ndoes not really make sense to try to zoom in on the approximation to the nearest tenth that will provide enough\nmaterial \u2013 44.8. The slabs are sold in 5-ft increments so it would not make sense to approximate further than the\nnearest whole number in this case.\nDiscuss other circumstances that require calculations with irrational numbers and what level of accuracy is\ndesired in different circumstances.\n8WB7 - 66 \uf0e32014 University of Utah Middle School Math Project in partnership with the\nUtah State Office of Education.
