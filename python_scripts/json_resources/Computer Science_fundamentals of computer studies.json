THE COURSE\nThe aims and objectives of this course include the following:\n1. to understand fundamentally the general scope of the computer system\n2. to interact effectively with the computer\n3. to know the uses of the basic components of the computer\n4. to manage the system to some extent before involving an expert\n5. to know some basic things about the computer and the world\nINTRODUCTION\nComputer as a revolution left no area of life untouched in the present world. It is of tremendous help in\nall field of life. Hence, the knowledge of computer is a necessity for existence of everybody in this global\nvillage. The invention of computer has transformed our simple manual works to sophisticated life of automated\nworks to meet the global demand for the higher productivity and increased efficiency with high precision.\nComputer is increasingly becoming compulsory in nearly all fields of studies, not because of anything\nbut its accuracy and versatility in processing data. Many tasks at home or office are being automated rapidly\nwith computer. Thus it is becoming apparent that in whatever discipline or working sector, the computer is now\na very vital tool for efficiency improvement and precision of job or task execution.\nThis is designed to meet the prerequisite need of everybody that are interested and wish to know about\ncomputers science and computing in general.\nA computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored in its own memory.\nThese instructions tell the machine what to do. The computer is capable of accepting data (input), processing\ndata arithmetically and logically, producing output from the processing, and storing the results for future use.\nMost computers that sit on a desktop are called Personal Computers (PCs).\nThe \"computer\" is an ensemble of different machines that you will be using to get your job done. A\ncomputer is primarily made of the Central Processing Unit (usually referred to as the computer), the monitor,\nthe keyboard, and the mouse. Other pieces of hardware are commonly referred to as peripherals.\nIn everyday life activities, we process data or encounter cases of data processing. A typical example of\ndata processing is the generation of statement of student result from the marks score in an examination and\ncontinuous assessment. It is essential to know that information is as good as the data from which it is derived,\nand the transformation process which they are subjected to. Meaningless data or inappropriate processing\nproduces wrong information. Thus computer gives you results corresponding to what data you supply and how\nyou process it (i.e. (cid:145)gabbage- in, gabbage-out(cid:146)).\nSummarily, the intelligent performance of a computer depends on correctness of input data and the\nintelligence performance of the human being that drives it.\nUSES OF COMPUTERS\nPeople use computers in many ways; business, computers are used to track inventories with bar codes\nand scanners, check the credit status of customers, and transfer funds electronically, homes, tiny computers\nembedded in the electronic circuitry of most appliances control the indoor temperature, operate home security\nsystems, tell the time, and turn video cassette recorders (VCRs) on and off, automobiles regulate the flow of\n1\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Computer Training Expert Solution Consults Fundamentals of Computer Studies\nfuel, thereby increasing gas mileage, they also entertain, creating digitized sound on stereo systems or\ncomputer-animated features from a digitally encoded laser disc.\nComputer programs, or applications, exist to aid every level of education, from programs that teach\nsimple addition or sentence construction to programs that teach advanced calculus. Educators use computers to\ntrack grades and communicate with students; with computer-controlled projection units, they can add graphics,\nsound, and animation to their communications. Computers are used extensively in scientific research to solve\nmathematical problems, investigate complicated data, or model systems that are too costly or impractical to\nbuild, such as testing the air flow around the next generation of aircraft. The military employs computers in\nsophisticated communications to encode and unscramble messages, and to keep track of personnel and supplies.\nHISTORY OF COMPUTING\nSince the creation of man, a significant amount of human activities has been ascribed to organizing and\nprocessing information so that it could be more easily presented for easy comprehension. Many devices have\nbeen used in the past before the advert of computer. It is then necessary to vividly look into their evolution.\nEarly computing machines:\n1. Abacus (-2500BC): This is a hand- held device made of beads stung on rods in a frame. The rods\ncorrespond to positions of the digits while the beads correspond to the digits.\n2. Napier(cid:146)s Bone (2500BC): This was invented by John Napier(cid:146)s (1550 - 1617). This consists of\nsmall rods with appropriate markings on them. It is a mechanical aid to computation that consists of nine such\nrods (called bones) with one for each digit 1 through 9. He also invented logarithms which made possible to do\ndivision and multiplication by performing addition and subtraction.\n3. Slide Rule (1600AD) by William Oughtred (1575 - 660): He invented it in 1622 but announced it\nin 1632 this consist of rules on which markings represent logarithms of numbers and also permits calculation\ninvolving exponents, trigonometric functions, etc.\n4. Pascal mechanical calculator (1600) or Numerical wheel calculator:-Blaise Pascal (1623 -1664)\nin 1642 invented the first adding machine called Pascaline. The brass rectangular box used eight moveable dials\nto add and sum up of eight figures long using base 10. It can perform all the four arithmetic operation with\nprevious unheard speed.\n5. Leibnitz mechanical multiplier (1600): In 1694 Gottfried Wilhem Von Leibnitz (1646 -1716)\nimproved upon the pascaline by creating a machine that can also multiply using a system of dials and gear.\n6 Colmar(cid:146)s Calculator (1820) by Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar: This presented a more\npractical approach to computing.\n7 Punched-Card machine (Jacquard(cid:146)s loom) (1801): Joseph Marie Jacquard.\n8 Mechanical computer: Charles Gabbage (1792-1871) Father of the computer. Difference engine\npowered by steam and large as locomotive the machine has a stored program and could perform calculations\nand print the result automatically. We also have Analytical engine credited to him.\n9 Hermann Hollerith (1860-1929)\n\uf0fc Hollerith(cid:146)s system punch-card reader machine:-for counting census result in 1890 in US.\n\uf0fc formed tabulating machine company in 1896(TMC)\n\uf0fc Automatic Tabulating Machine (ATM)-1900\n\uf0fc TMC was renamed to International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) in 1924 after series of\nmergers.\nIn summary, the history of computing began with an analog machine. In 1623 German scientist Wilhelm\nSchikard invented a machine that could add, and with the aid of logarithm tables, multiply and divide. Since\nthen the development has pass through a lot of stages such as the invention of punched cards to program\npatterns to create woven fabrics by Joseph-Marie Jacquard a French inventor in 19th century. Another early\n2\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Computer Training Expert Solution Consults Fundamentals of Computer Studies\nmechanical computer was the Difference Engine, designed in the early 1820s by British mathematician and\nscientist Charles Babbage. In the 1930s American mathematician Howard Aiken developed the Mark I\ncalculating machine, which was built by IBM. This electronic calculating machine used relays and\nelectromagnetic components to replace mechanical components.\nTo be sincere, the world has left the era of hearing stories about computer. We are now in the world of\nwhat you can use it for to serve its desired purposes.\nGENERATIONS OF COMPUTERS\nThe history of computer development is often referred to in reference to the different generations of\ncomputing devices. Each generation of computer is characterized by a major technological development that\nfundamentally changed the way computers operate, resulting in increasingly smaller, cheaper, more powerful,\nefficient and reliable devices.\nFirst Generation - 1940-1956: Vacuum Tubes\nThe first computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory, and were often\nenormous, taking up entire rooms. They were very expensive to operate and in addition to using a great deal of\nelectricity, generated a lot of heat, which was often the cause of malfunctions. First generation computers relied\non machine language to perform operations, and they could only solve one problem at a time. Input was based\non punched cards and paper tape, and output was displayed on printouts. The UNIVAC and ENIAC computers\nare examples of first-generation computing devices. The UNIVAC was the first commercial computer delivered\nto a business client. It was used in the 1951U.S. Bureau Census.\nSecond Generation - 1956-1963: Transistors\nTransistors replaced vacuum tubes and ushered in the second generation of computers. The transistor\nwas invented in 1947 but did not see widespread use in computers until the late 50s. The transistor was a vast\nimprovement over the vacuum tube, allowing computers to become smaller, faster, cheaper, more energy-\nefficient and more reliable than their first-generation predecessors. Second-generation computers still relied on\npunched cards for input and printouts for output. Second-generation computers moved from cryptic binary\nmachine language to symbolic, or assembly, languages, which allowed programmers to specify instructions in\nwords. High-level programming languages were also being developed at this time, such as early versions of\nCOBOL and FORTRAN. These were also the first computers that stored their instructions in their memory,\nwhich moved from a magnetic drum to magnetic core technology. The first computers of this generation were\ndeveloped for the atomic energy industry.\nThird Generation - 1964-1971: Integrated Circuits\nThe development of the integrated circuit was the hallmark of the third generation of computers.\nTransistors were miniaturized and placed on silicon chips, called semiconductors, which drastically increased\nthe speed and efficiency of computers. Instead of punched cards and printouts, users interacted with third\ngeneration computers through keyboards and monitors and interfaced with an operating system, which allowed\nthe device to run many different applications at one time with a central program that monitored the memory.\nComputers for the first time became accessible to a mass audience because they were smaller and cheaper than\ntheir predecessors.\nFourth Generation - 1971-Present: Microprocessors\nThe microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers, as thousands of integrated circuits were\n3\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Computer Training Expert Solution Consults Fundamentals of Computer Studies\nbuilt onto a single silicon chip. What in the first generation filled an entire room could now fit in the palm of the\nhand. In 1981 IBM introduced its first computer for the home user, and in 1984 Apple introduced the\nMacintosh. Microprocessors also moved out of the realm of desktop computers and into many areas of life as\nmore and more everyday products began to use microprocessors. As these small computers became more\npowerful, they could be linked together to form networks, which eventually led to the development of the\nInternet. Fourth generation computers also saw the development of GUIs, the mouse and handheld devices.\nFifth Generation - Present and Beyond: Artificial Intelligence\nFifth generation computing devices, based on artificial intelligence, are still in development, though\nthere are some applications, such as voice recognition, that are being used today. The use of parallel processing\nand superconductors is helping to make artificial intelligence a reality. Quantum computation and molecular\nand nanotechnology will radically change the face of computers in years to come. The goal of fifth-generation\ncomputing is to develop devices that respond to natural language input and are capable of learning and self-\norganization.\nSOFTWARE AND HARDWARE\nHardware is the term given to the physical components of a computer: e.g. keyboard, monitor, system box or\nfloppy disk drive. Software, on the other hand, is electronic information: files, operating system, graphics,\ncomputer programs are all example of software. The difference between hardware and software reflects the\nduality between the physical and mental worlds: for example, your brain is hardware, whereas your mind is\nsoftware.\nSoftware is the stuff that makes your computer do things for you. The computer without software would\nbe like a home entertainment system with no tapes, CD(cid:146)s, or movies - you have the machine, but there(cid:146)s nothing\nto play on it. Software is continually developed. Each time the software maker (Microsoft, Adobe, Corel, etc)\ndevelops a new version of their software they assign it a version number. Before Microsoft Word 7, there was\nMicrosoft Word 6.0.1, and before that Word 6.0. The larger the developments made to the software, the larger\nthe version number changes. Usually a large change will result in a whole number upgrade; a small change may\nresult in a tenth of a decimal place.\nHardware are those components or physical pieces (things you can touch) that make up the computer.\nThe different pieces of the computer(cid:146)s hardware are monitor, speakers, mouse, CDROM, floppy drive, hard\ndrive, keyboard, CPU, RAM, Processor, etc. Each piece plays a role in the operation of a computer.\nDIFFERENT PARTS OF A COMPUTER AND THEIR USES\nThe standard computer consists of a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse and the system unit. One can attach\naccessories such as printers and scanners by means of ports. Increasingly in the workplace, computers are\nconnected to printers and other computers by means of a network.\n4\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Computer Training Expert Solution Consults Fundamentals of Computer Studies\nFigure 1: Computer System Hardware\nThe monitor\nThis is the Visual Display Unit (VDU). There are various technologies for the display unit,\ncathode ray tube (CRT) or Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) or electro luminescent screens or\nthe projector. The monitor or screen displays your work. Facing it down reduces reflected\nglare from room lights. This reflection may affect your sight. Monitors come in different\nsizes. The (most important) size of the monitor is measured diagonally on the screen (in\ninches). Based on this, the monitors range in sizes of 12\", 14\", 15\", 17\", 19\", 21\", 29\", etc.\nMonitors are also characterized by the flatness of their screen. The flatter and the wider screens are usually\nthe better.\nThe system box or computer console\nThe system box is where all the computations that the computer performs take place. Inside\nare the CPU processor, the motherboard, the hard disk, any network or sound cards, memory\nchips (RAM), printer ports (at the back) and the drive bays for floppy disks, Zip disks or\nCDs. Outside the casings are the power buttons (ON\/OFF and Restart) with some additional\nfacilities like the casing USB ports, Webcams, etc.\nThe keyboard (Pressing)\nThis is the basic input device. It is one of the ways you can tell the computer what to do. It\nconsists of the standard typewriter keys as well as a numeric keypad and function keys.\nYou can use it to give the computer commands, name folders and files, and type text in\nword processing documents. The keyboard is made of three main categories of keys with\neach used for a different purpose.\ni. Character Keys: These comprise of letters, numbers and the symbols. They are used to insert\/display\nreadable characters on the screen which is equivalent to the keystroke pressed.\nLetters a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z\n5\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Computer Training Expert Solution Consults Fundamentals of Computer Studies\nNumbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nSymbols\nAccent ` Dash\/Minus - Equal = Opening Square [ Closing Square ]\nBracket Bracket\nBackslash \\ Semi-Colon ; Single-Quote ' Pipe | Greater than >\nLess than < Comma , Period .

Action Keys: These are not used to type anything, instead they cause an action. Escape, Tab, Caps Lock,\nShift, Control, Alt, Backspace, Enter, Windows, Win Menu, Print Screen, Scroll Lock, Pause Break, Number\nLock, Insert, Home, Page Up, Delete, End, Page Down, Power, Sleep, Wake up, Up Arrow, Left Arrow, Right\nArrow, Down Arrow, and Space Bar.\niii. Application-Dependant Keys: These are called function keys. They are F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9,\nF10, F11, and F12. Although the F1 key is usually used to get help while working in Microsoft Windows, the\nuse of the other keys varies from one application to another. Eventually, the application you use will give you\ninstructions on what to do and how to use the function keys.\nKey Combinations\nSome keys can be combined to produce uppercase letters or to access the upper symbols of some keys (i.e. the\nShift and Control keys). Keys are also combined for many other reasons. In some situations, you have to press\nkeys simultaneously, which means that you may be expected to press two or more keys at the same time, or\nalmost at the same time. In some other situations, you may have to press and release one key, followed by\nanother.\nShortcuts\nA shortcut is a quick action you ask a program to perform when you press one particular key or a combination\nof keys. Some shortcuts are universal or almost, that is, the computer responds regardless of what application is\nrunning. Some other shortcuts depend on what you have on your screen. Some shortcuts are already known to\nthe computer (as part of the operating system). Most other shortcuts are set by the programmer of the particular\napplication you are using. Yet some applications allow you to create your own shortcuts. Some shortcuts are\nreadily obvious and can be seen from the main menu of the application. Some other shortcuts are either part of\nMicrosoft Windows (and can be applied in your program) or are not easily displayed, you might have to search\nthe Help documentation of the program you are using.\nThe Mouse (Clicking and Dragging)\nThis is another input device used to move a small white arrow pointer-the Cursor (but the shape will\nchange depending on the context in which the mouse is being used) on the screen. By pointing and\nclicking you can carry out commands. The computer may ask you to verify that you are sure to\nrename a file, by clicking on the (cid:145)Ok(cid:146) button. A mouse is primarily made of three parts: the buttons,\nthe handling area, and the sensor (rolling object or light). There are either one, two or three mouse\nbuttons. By default, a mouse has two buttons: left and right. Most mice nowadays are also equipped with a\nwheel on top of the middle button called the Scroll Button.\n6\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Computer Training Expert Solution Consults Fundamentals of Computer Studies\nTo use the mouse, the first decision you make is to know which of your two hands you will be using to\nhandle the mouse. By default, the mouse is configured to work for the right hand. If you are left-handed, the\nsettings can be changed to suit your needs: Start \uf0e8 Control Panel \uf0e8 Double-click Mouse \uf0e8 on the Buttons\nTab, Check the Switch Primary and Secondary Buttons check box.\nYou can also change the cursor from the default Up-Left Pointing to another but you should know that this is\nbest determined by the computer as this varies from program to program. To change, click the Pointer(cid:146)s Tab.\nAlso click the other tabs to review the different properties.\nNote: The expression \"by default\" means \"if everything is not (yet) changed from the original or normal\nsettings\".\nFigure 2: Mouse Properties Dialog Box\nThe tip of the mouse pointer must be positioned on the item you want to use (Pointing). To select an\nitem, point to the item and click once (Selection (cid:150) Left Clicking). Double-clicking (left button) on an icon\ninvokes a command or launches an application. Dragging an item (icon or other object) from one location to\nanother, position the mouse pointer on the item, click and hold the mouse buttons (left, right) down, and move\nthe item to the new location. Right Clicking (right button) invokes a shortcut (contextual) menu that contains\nall the actions that are related to the item. Some applications, namely programs used to manipulate text (they are\ncalled word processors), allow you to triple-click.\nOn Windows machines, there is a left and right mouse button. Most time you use the left mouse button\n(if you are right-handed). On some newer Macs, the same feature can be used with their single mouse button by\nholding down the Control key as you click an item on the screen.\nThe Peripherals\nAll the parts we have reviewed so far are usually required for the computer to function. Some other parts, not\nrequired, can also be connected to the computer to complement it. A peripheral is an object attached to the\ncomputer to help it perform some necessary assignments none of the other parts can handle. In most\nscenarios, no peripheral is required but nowadays, it is unusual for a computer not to have any peripheral at\nall. The most used peripherals are the printer, a digital camera, a scanner, a projector, an external drive (such\nas an external CD burner for an old computer), etc.\n7\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Computer Training Expert Solution Consults Fundamentals of Computer Studies\nDisk Size Conversion Chart (Bits, Bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes and Gigabytes)\nBit- Binary digit:-a single elements in the computer memory that can store either 1 or 0\nWord (cid:150) 1Byte, 2Byte or 4Byte depending on the machine. Generally computer word length is giving in bits;\nhence we have 8bit, 18bit or 32bit microprocessor computer.\nTable 1: Computer Storage Devices Unit Conversion\nUnit Equivalent to\n1Byte 8 Bits\n1kilobyte (kB) 1,024Byte\n1MB 1,024KB = 1,024,000Byte\n1GB 1,024MB = 1,024,000,000Byte\nTYPES OF COMPUTERS\nAnalog computer\nThese systems were the first type to be produced. It is an electronic machine capable of performing\narithmetic functions on numbers which are represented by some physical quantities such as temperature,\npressure, voltage, etc. Analog refers to circuits or numerical values that have a continuous range. Popular analog\ncomputer used in the 20th century was the slide rule.\nDigital Computers\nVirtually all modern computers are digital. Digital refers to the processes in computers that manipulate\nbinary numbers (0s or 1s), which represent switches that are turned on or off by electrical current. A bit can\nhave the value 0 or the value 1, but nothing in between 0 and 1. A desk lamp can serve as an example of the\ndifference between analog and digital. If the lamp has a simple on\/off switch, then the lamp system is digital,\nbecause the lamp either produces light at a given moment or it does not. If a dimmer replaces the on\/off switch,\nthen the lamp is digital, because the amount of light can vary continuously from on to off and all intensities in\nbetween. Digital computers are more common in use and it will be our focus of discussion.\nHybrid Computer\nThis is when a computer make is of both analog and digital components and techniques. Such computer\nrequire analog to digital and digital to analog converter which will make analog and digital data palatable to it.\nThe basic classification nowadays uses the following.\n1. The Desktop\nA computer is referred to as \"desktop\" when it is relatively small enough to be positioned on top\nof a table where a person is working. Such a computer can also be placed on the floor or\nsomewhere under, or aside of, the table, in which case the monitor would be placed on top of the\ntable. This is the most common type of computers used in the office or at home. A desktop\ncomputer is made of different parts that are connected with cables.\n2. The Laptop\nA computer is called laptop when it combines the CPU, the monitor, the keyboard, and the mouse in one unit to\nbe so small that you can carry it on your laps when traveling or commuting. A laptop is also called\na notebook. Other parts, such as an external mouse, an external keyboard, or peripherals such as a\nprinter or a projector, can be connected to the laptop. A laptop is only physically smaller than a\ndesktop but, everything considered, it can do anything that a desktop can do.\n3. The Server\nA server is a computer that holds information that other\ncomputers, called workstations, can retrieve. Such workstations\nare connected to the server using various means. This means that\n8\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Computer Training Expert Solution Consults Fundamentals of Computer Studies\nthey could be connected using cable, wireless connection, etc. Only computers that maintain a type of\nconnection with the server can get the information that is stored in the server.\nNormally, although not particularly recommended, any computer, including a desktop or even a laptop can be\nused as a server, as long as it can do the job required. A server is more defined by the program (called an\noperating system) that is installed in it, not how the machine looks.\nAny type of computer, including a desktop, a laptop, a CD or DVD machine, etc can be connected to a server.\nThe person who sets up a server also defines the types of connections it is made for.\n4. The Mainframe\nA mainframe is a computer, usually physically big, that does almost all the jobs for other types of\ncomputers that are connected to it. This is a broad definition but other aspects are involved. Like a\nserver, the program (operating system) that runs in the mainframe defines its role.\nANATOMY OF COMPUTER SYSTEM\nA typical computer system irrespective of its size, class or type consists of hardware and software,\nintegrated and harmonized together to perform computational work (scientific or military) or data processing.\nCOMPUTER HARDWARE\nHardware system: Computer hardware consists of the components that can be physically handled. It\nrefers to the physical units or machine of functional units, which makes up the computer configuration which is\ndone to suit the goals and objectives of the user. The function of these components is typically divided into\nthree main categories: input, output, and storage. Components in these categories connect to microprocessors,\nspecifically, the computer(cid:146)s central processing unit (CPU), the electronic circuitry that provides the\ncomputational ability and control of the computer, via wires or circuitry called a bus. Hardware may be\nclassified into Central Processing Units (CPU) and the peripherals. The CPU entails Control Unit (CU),\nArithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) and the Internal Memory Unit (IMU) or main memory. The peripherals\nconsist of the input, output and Auxiliary Storage Units.\nStrictly speaking, computer is made up of five district elements to include:\n1. A central processing unit (ALU and CU)\n2. Input unit\n3. Output unit\n4. Storage unit (Internal and Auxiliary)\n5. The communication network; (cid:147)Bus(cid:148) that links all the elements of the system, and connects the\n6. External world. (Cables and Cords)\nMOTHERBOARD: The motherboard is a printed circuit board that connects other components through\nthe use of traces, or electrical pathways. The motherboard is indispensable to the computer and provides the\nmain computing capability. Personal computers normally have one central processing unit (CPU) on the\nmotherboard.\nTHE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU)\nThis is the main brain of the computer that accepts data, performs operations on the data and sends out\nthe result.Information from an input device or from the computer(cid:146)s memory is communicated via the bus to the\nCentral Processing Unit (CPU), which is the part of the computer that translates commands and runs programs.\nIt consists of ALU and CU, and a single chip or series of chips that performs arithmetic and logical calculations\n9\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Computer Training Expert Solution Consults Fundamentals of Computer Studies\nand controls the operations of the other elements of the system.\nMost CPU chips are composed of four functional sections:\n1. ALU: Calculating ability either arithmetical or logical operations.\n2. Registers: Temporary storage areas that hold data, keep tracks of instruction, and hold the location and\nresults of these operations.\n3. Control section: Times and regulates the operation of the entire computer system, by using its instruction\ndecoder to read patterns of data in a designated register and translate the patterns into activities, such as\naddition or comparison. It also uses its interrupt input to indicate the order in which individual operations\nuses the CPU and regulates the amount of CPU time allotted to each operation.\n4. Internal Bus: Network of communication lines that connects the internal elements of the processor and also\nleads to external connectors that links the processor to the other element of the computer.\nThe main functions of the microprocessor (CPU clips) includes the following.\na. Control use of the main storage in storing data and instructions (i.e the ROM).\nb. Control the sequence of operations.\nc. Give commands to all parts of the computer system.\nd. Carry out processing.\nINPUT DEVICES\nInput unit consists of external devices(cid:151)that is, components outside the computer(cid:146)s CPU. It provides or\nfetches information and instructions to the computer. These include keyboard, mouse (mechanical\/ opto-\nmechanical\/ opticals), light pen, joystick, scanner, microphones (voice recognition modules), Optical Character\nReader (OCR), Magnetic Ink Character Reader Recognition (MICR), bar code reader, badge reader, digitizer,\ntouch screen and optical mark reader (OMR).\nA. Light pen: This is a stylus with a light sensitive tip that is used to draw directly on a computer(cid:146)s video\nscreen or to select information on the screen by pressing a clip in the light pen or by pressing the light\npen against the surface of the screen. The pen contains light sensors that identify which portion of the\nscreen it is passed over. It is mostly used with Laptop.\nB. Mouse: This is a pointing device designed to be gripped by one hand. It has a detection device (usually\na ball) on the bottom that enables the user to control the motion of an on-screen pointer, or cursor, by\nmoving the mouse on a flat surface. As the device moves across the surface, the cursor moves across the\nscreen. To select items or choose commands on the screen, the user presses a button on the mouse.\nC. Joystick is a pointing device composed of a lever that moves in multiple directions to navigate a cursor\nor other graphical object on a computer screen.\nD. Keyboard: Keyboard is typewriter-like devices that allows the user to type in text, numeric and execute\ncommands with the aid of the functional keys on the keyboard.\nE. Optical Scanner: This is light-sensing equipment that converts images such as a picture or text into\nelectronic signals that can be manipulated by a computer. For example, a photograph can be scanned\ninto a computer and then included in a text document created on that computer. The two most common\nscanner types are the flatbed scanner, which is similar to an office photocopier, and the handheld\nscanner, which is passed manually across the image to be processed.\nF. Microphone: This is a device for converting sound into signals that can then be stored, manipulated,\nand played back by the computer. A voice recognition module is a device that converts spoken words\ninto information that the computer can recognize and process.\nG. Modem: It stands for modulator-demodulator, is a device that connects a computer to a telephone line\nor cable television network and allows information to be transmitted to or received from another\ncomputer. Each computer that sends or receives information must be connected to a modem.\n10\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Computer Training Expert Solution Consults Fundamentals of Computer Studies\nOUTPUT DEVICES\nOutput devices consists of hardware that transfer information from the computer(cid:146)s CPU to the computer\nuser. This includes the monitor, Printer, plotters, or speaker.\nVideo Graphic Adapter: This is a device that converts information generated by the computer into visual\ninformation called Monitor. It looks similar to a television set. Information from the CPU is displayed on the\nscreen of the monitor.\nPrinters: Information and graphics processed or produced with the aid of computer are printed out as hardcopy\nwith the aid of printer. There are different types of printers; Dot-matrix printers, Laser printers, Inkjet, etc.\nPlotters: Computer output to microfilm or fiche (COM) which process information on rolls of film (drum\nplotter) or slide of film (flatbed plotter).\nSTORAGE DEVICES\nStorage devices provide permanent storage of information and programs for retrieval by the computer.\nThe two main types of storage devices are disk drives and memory. There are several types of disk drives:\nhard disk drive, floppy disk, magneto-optical, and compact disk.\nHard disk drives store information in magnetic particles embedded in a disk. Usually a permanent part of the\ncomputer, hard disk drives can store large amounts of information and retrieve that information very quickly.\nThe disks are of different sizes such as 1G, 10G, 40G, etc.\nFloppy disk drives also store information in magnetic particles embedded in removable disks. Floppy disks\nstore less information than a hard disk drive and retrieve the information at a much slower rate. It is of 2 type\n51\/4 floppy disk and 31\/ floppy disk.\n2\nMagneto-optical disc drives store information on removable discs that are sensitive to both laser light and\nmagnetic fields. They can typically store as much information as hard disks, but they have slightly slower\nretrieval speeds.\nCompact Disc Drives store information on pits burned into the surface of a disc of reflective material such as\nCD-ROM. CD-ROMs can store about as much information as a hard drive but have a slower rate of information\nretrieval.\nDigital Video Disc (DVD): This is similar and works like a CD-ROM but can store more than 15times as much\ninformation.\nFlash drives work as floppy disks but more sensitive as a hard disk that must be ejected logical before final\nremoval from the computer system. It has more memory than floppy disks.\nMemory Cards work as flash drive but with an additional device called the card reader. This is very effective\nand more durable than the flash drives.\nSome devices serve more than one purpose. For example, floppy disks may also be used as input devices if\nthey contain information to be used and processed by the computer user. In addition, they can be used as output\ndevices if the user wants to store the results of computations on them.\nSYSTEM MEMORY\nMemory refers to the computer chips that store information for quick retrieval by the CPU. They are\nbasically divided into two ROM and RAM.\nRandom Access Memory (RAM) is used to store information and instructions that operate the\ncomputer(cid:146)s programs. Typically, programs are transferred from storage on a disk drive to RAM. RAM is also\nknown as volatile memory because the information within the computer chips is lost when power to the\n11\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Computer Training Expert Solution Consults Fundamentals of Computer Studies\ncomputer is turned off or the computer hanged.\nRead-Only Memory (ROM) contains critical information and software that must be permanently\navailable for computer operation, such as the operating system that directs the computer(cid:146)s actions from start up\nto shut down. ROM is called non-volatile memory because the memory chips do not lose their information\nwhen power to the computer is turned off.\nHARDWARE CONNECTIONS\nTo function, hardware requires physical connections that allow components to communicate and\ninteract. A bus provides a common interconnected system composed of a group of wires or circuitry that\ncoordinates and moves information between the internal parts of a computer. A bus is characterized by two\nfeatures: how much information it can manipulate at one time, called the bus width, and how quickly it can\ntransfer these data.\nA serial connection is a wire or set of wires used to transfer information from the CPU to an external device\nsuch as a mouse, keyboard, modem, scanner, and some types of printers. This type of connection transfers only\none piece of data at a time, and is therefore slow. The advantage of using a serial connection is that it provides\neffective connections over long distances.\nA parallel connection uses multiple sets of wires to transfer blocks of information simultaneously. Most\nscanners and printers use this type of connection. A parallel connection is much faster than a serial connection,\nbut it is limited to distances of less than 3 m (10 ft) between the CPU and the external device.\nCOMPUTER SOFTWARE\nSoftware is the set of instruction that tells the computer what to do and when to do it. The computer uses\nthis instruction to manipulate data, and enhance the proper functioning of the hardware components. It is\ndesigned to exploit and provide the potential capabilities of the hardware to the user. It converts data into\ninformation and allows users to use the computer in different ways.\nComputer programs are written by human beings, like you. This means that the person who writes a\nprogram also decides on its functionality and behaviour; which explains why two programs that are supposed to\ndo the same thing, don't do it the same way. This is why, regardless of your expertise, you need to be acquainted\nwith a particular program in order to make better use of it. The fact that you don't know a particular program\ndoesn't say anything about your intelligence or lack of it. It simply means that you are not familiar with that\nprogram.\nThese programs are usually stored and transferred via the computer(cid:146)s hardware to and from the CPU.\nSoftware also governs how the hardware is utilized; for example, how information is retrieved from a storage\ndevice. The interaction between the input and output devices is controlled by software called the Basic Input\nOutput System (BIOS) Software. Software as a whole can be divided into a number of categories based on the\ntypes of work done by programs. The two primary software categories are system software, and application\nsoftware.\nSYSTEM SOFTWARE\nThis refers to set of programs that facilitate the optional use of the hardware systems by coordinating\nthem. It consists of programs that start up the computer and perform some utility functions such as checking and\ngetting the computer ready for use. They are usually written to accomplish loading, execution, storage, and\nretrieval of files from\/into the computer. They are basically operating system, utility software, and language\n12\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Computer Training Expert Solution Consults Fundamentals of Computer Studies\ntranslators.\nOperating System\nAn operating system is a program that acts as an intermediary between the application programs and the\ncomputer hardware.You cannot directly use computer applications (or programs) with computer hardware\nwithout a translation system between the hardware and the applications. This translation system is called the\noperating system (OS). The Windows or Mac OS works (cid:147)behind-the-scenes(cid:148) to run your computer (i.e. the\nsoftware and the hardware). It tells the computer what to do when it starts up and keeps track of your\ndocuments, files, and other software. It also provides the standard user interface component (like menus and the\ndesktop) that you see when you look at your computer screen. Both the Windows and the Mac OS operating\nsystems use a graphical interface (pictures or icons instead of text) that allow you to immerse yourself in\nmultitasking (accessing multiple applications and files simultaneously). You work with (cid:147)windows(cid:148) in this\ninterface. These windows are a series of boxes, which can be opened and closed as needed.\nWe shall be using Microsoft Windows Operating System as it is the most common on the personal\ncomputers. There are various types of Microsoft Windows. A type of Microsoft Windows is referred to as a\nversion. Examples of versions are Microsoft Windows 3.3, Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows NT\nWorkstation, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition,\nMicrosoft Windows Millennium, Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, Microsoft Windows 2000 Server,\nMicrosoft Windows XP Home Edition, Microsoft Windows XP Professional, and Microsoft Windows Server\n2003.\nOperating System Components\nProcess management Networking\nMemory management System Protection\nFile management Command-interpreter system\nSecondary storage management\nThe Operating System Layer\nFigure 3: Operating System Layers\nOperating System is the basic software that controls the major operation of the computer. It is the master control\nprogram, permanently stored in memory, which interprets users commands requesting various kinds of services\n13\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nsuch as display, print or copy a data files; list all files in a directory; or execute a particular program. It provides\nthe link between the user, the application program and the computer hardware with a view to controlling and\nmanaging the operation of the computer. The operating system has four major functions: It coordinates and\nmanipulates computer hardware, it organizes and manages files on a variety of storage media, it manages the\nfunction of processor, and it interfaces with user.\nFunction of the OS\n\uf0b7 Resource sharing: manages resources by ensuring proper and effective use.\n\uf0b7 Provision of virtual machine: Hidings the hardware details from the user.\n\uf0b7 Memory management: It manages the effective usage of internal memory, RAM while running multi-\nprograms.\n\uf0b7 Protector and error handling.\n\uf0b7 File management.\n\uf0b7 Facilitates booting\n\uf0b7 Manages multitasking: determines which application should run, in what order, and how much time should\nbe allowed for each application before giving another application access to run.\nClassification of OS\nThis could be done based on the number of program they can handle at the same time or the number of\nuser(s) that can be accommodated on the system simultaneously. Hence we have single tasking and multitasking\n(for class1) and, single user and multi-user OS (for class 2).\nSingle user OS is multitasking but can only allow only one user at a time e.g. PC-DOS, MS-DOS, CP\/M,\nOS\/2. Multi-user OS is multitasking and at the same time multi-user. This is done when a number of computers\n(workstation) connect to a central computer so that all the other computers can use the work on the central\ncomputer e.g. UNIX, XENIX, PC-MOS, windows NT, Linux and Novell.\nThe Difference between Windows &Macs\nThe personal computer industry has generally sorted itself out along the lines of two major operating\nsystems: Mac and Windows. The Mac OS runs on CPUs made by Apple Computer. The Windows OS, made by\nMicrosoft, runs on CPUs made by many different companies, but not Apple. Some of these companies are:\nIBM, Dell, Compaq, Gateway, Fujitsu, Sony, etc. When people talk about the differences between Windows\nand Macs, in general, they are expressing a personal preference about which operating system or hardware they\nbelieve to be superior.\nUtility Software\nThis program is produced by the manufacturers to provide useful facilities for performing common computing\ntasks of a routine nature to many computer system e.g. system generator, text editor, antivirus, dumping routine,\nhousekeeping operations etc.\nLanguage translator\nThe language the computer understand is machine language (Os and 1s) which is very tedious, time consuming,\nhard to write\/read, or debug. Any program written in another language than this needs language translator which\n14\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\ncarries out the translation to this machine language. The 3 main types of translators are Assemblers, Compilers\nand Interpreter.\nAPPLICATION SOFTWARE\nApplication Software is a computer program designed to help people perform a certain type of task. An\napplication thus differs from an operating system (which runs a computer), a utility (which performs\nmaintenance or general-purpose tasks), or a language translator (with which computer programs are created).\nDepending on the work for which it was designed, an application can manipulate text, numbers, graphics, or a\ncombination of these elements. Some application packages offer considerable computing power by focusing on\na single task, such as word processing, spreadsheet, graphics, and a database program.\nTable 2: Different computer programs with their areas of application\nApplication Areas Package\nWord processing NotePad (text editor), WordPad, Word perfect, WordStar, Microsoft word\nBudgeting, accounting Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft excel,\nDatabases Database 3,4 oracle, Microsoft excel, Corel Paradox, dBase, SQL, M-Access\nGraphics CorelDraw, Adobe Photoshop, Jasc Paint Shop Pro, Instant Artist, Print Artist\nSpreadsheets Microsoft Excel and Access, Corel Quattro Pro, Sun StarCalc\nBook publishing PageMaker, Microsoft publisher\nSeminar presentation PowerPoint\nEngineering drawing AutoCAD, ArchiCAD, electronic desktop\nStatistical analysis SPSS, SPLUS, statistical\nWeb design Microsoft FrontPage\nCLASSIFICATION OF COMPUTERS ACCORDING TO SIZE\nComputers exist in a wide range of sizes and power. The smallest are embedded within the circuitry of\nappliances, such as televisions and wristwatches. These computers are typically pre-programmed for a specific\ntask, such as tuning to a particular television frequency, delivering doses of medicine, or keeping accurate time.\nThey generally are (cid:147)hard-wired(cid:148)(cid:151)that is, their programs are represented as circuits that cannot be\nreprogrammed.\nMini Computers (Laptop, Notebook Computers and Desktop PCs) are typically used in businesses and\nat home to communicate on computer networks, for word processing, to track finances, and for entertainment.\nThey are equipped with a keyboard; a mouse, trackball, or other devices; and a video display monitor or liquid\ncrystal display (LCD) to display information. Laptop and notebook computers usually have similar hardware\nand software as PCs, but they are more compact and have flat, lightweight LCDs instead of television-like video\ndisplay monitors. If equipped with a cellular phone, they can connect to worldwide computer networks to\nexchange information regardless of location.\nWorkstations are similar to personal computers but have greater memory and more extensive\nmathematical abilities, and they are connected to other workstations or personal computers to exchange data.\nThey are typically found in scientific, industrial, and business environments(cid:151)especially financial ones, such as\nstock exchanges(cid:151)that require complex and fast computations.\nMainframe computers have more memory, speed, and capabilities than workstations and are usually\nshared by multiple users through a series of interconnected computers. The most powerful mainframe\ncomputers, called supercomputers, control businesses, industrial works, scientific research and process complex\n15\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nand time-consuming calculations, such as those used to create weather predictions. Large businesses, scientific\ninstitutions, and the military use them. Some supercomputers have many sets of CPUs. These computers break a\ntask into small pieces, and each CPU processes a portion of the task to increase overall speed and efficiency.\nSuch computers are called parallel processors. As computers have increased in sophistication, the boundaries\nbetween the various types have become less rigid.\nCOMPUTER VIRUSES AND SECURITY\nCOMPUTER VIRUSES\nVirus is a self-duplicating computer program that interferes with a computer(cid:146)s hardware or operating\nsystem. They range from being merely irritating (or disturbing) to the very destructive. Computer viruses\nactivate when the instructions (payload of the virus) or executable code that run programs are opened. Once a\nvirus is active, it may replicate by various means and infect the computer(cid:146)s files or the operating system. For\nexample, it may copy parts of itself to floppy disks, to the computer(cid:146)s hard drive, into legitimate computer\nprograms, or it may attach itself to e-mail messages and spread across computer networks by infecting other\nshared drives. Viruses attached to e-mail messages can infect an entire local network in minutes (this is\nspecifically called WORM).\nThousands of viruses and worms exist and can quickly contaminate millions of computers. People who\nintentionally create viruses are computer experts called HACKERS; they also violate confidentiality by\nobserving computer monitors and by impersonating authorised users in other to gain access to the user(cid:146)s\ncomputer databases to steal the identities of other people by obtaining privately identified information about\nthem. They also engage in software piracy and deface website on the internet. They develop powerful software\n(cid:147)crime tools(cid:148) such as the following:\na. Internet eavesdropping snuffers which intercepts internet messages sent to other computers\nb. Password guessers that tries millions of combinations of characters in an effect to guess a computer(cid:146)s\npassword.\nc. Vulnerability testers that look for software weaknesses\nd. Computer services saturator\ne. Automatic computer virus generator.\nTypes of Viruses\na. A boot sector virus stores itself at the start of a disk and becomes activated by reading, starting or restarting\nthe computer when that disk is in the boot drive.\nb. A file infector virus attaches itself to program files i.e. files that give instructions to a computer. These files\nusually have extensions like exe, com, or bat. When the program is run, the virus executes.\nc. A macro virus affects data files, especially Word documents and Excel workbooks. This virus type\naccounts for the vast majority of infected files. When the infected document is opened and the macro are\nrun, the virus is triggered and can perform system operations such as creating or deleting files or writing\ninto already existing files and thus have the potential to cause a great deal of damage.\nd. Worm or an email virus (for the purpose of this guide) is not really a virus at all (in that it is not self-\nreplicating) but a chain letter phenomenon sent through email. The message will, for some reason or other,\ntell you to pass this message on to as many people as possible. Hoax virus alerts are typical examples of\nchain emails. These are distinct from viruses in that they do not have host file like most other viruses but are\ncarried on the internet and can spread from one computer to another by themselves without the need for a\nuser to assist the process by giving someone an infected file or disk. They are usually spread through the\n16\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\ninternet as an attachment.\ne. Trojan horses are programs that have some hidden, generally malicious functionality that the computer\ndoes not expect. They claim to be a thing (e.g. an audio for example), when they are actually another (e.g.\ncode that will overwrite a portion of your hard disk). They do not run their own like a virus does but rely on\ntricking the user to run them. They don(cid:146)t also replicate themselves which is a major distinction between a\nvirus and a Trojan.\nHow Viruses are Spread\nViruses are spread by running infected programs or opening infected files. This can occur by using any of the\nfollowing methods:\nPassing floppy disks from PC to PC\nDownloading (copying) infected files from the Internet\nOpening an email attachment\nBooting a PC with an infected bootable disk.\nComputer viruses work in two phases: infection phase and the attack phase.\nInfection phase: in order to infect a computer, a virus has to possess the chance to get executed before it can\ninfect the computer system and spread to others. Events that can trigger the execution of virus are included\nabove.\nAttack phase: viruses do destructive things such as deleting files, erasing data on a hard disk, sending random\nemails or slowing down the processor by sending millions of looped instructions. Since most users will try their\nbest to delete the virus once it launches the attack, most virus delay revealing their presence by launching their\nattack only after they have had ample opportunity to spread. This means the attack may be delayed for a long\ntime after the infection.\nPrevention of Computer Virus\nComputer users can prepare for a viral infection by creating backups of legitimate original software and\ndata files regularly so that the computer system can be restored if necessary. However, the best prevention may\nbe the installation of current and well-designed antiviral software. Such software can prevent a viral infection\nand thereby help stop its spread.\nOr obtain a virus checker for your own machine then register the program with the manufacturers. They will\nregularly send you updated versions of the software while your agreement is current. New viruses keep\nappearing, so out of date virus software will not protect you and the checker is essential. Install the available\nsecurity patches, particularly for Microsoft products. Keep your floppy disk write-protected whenever possible.\nIf you are really cautious, change the set-up option in your computer(cid:146)s BIOS so that it will always boot from the\nhard disk, not from floppies.\nWrite protect MS Word(cid:146)s Normal template to get limited protection against macro viruses. This template will\nbe a file called Normal.dot. Select the Read Only bod. Note that this will not disinfect existing infected files.\n17\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nIn Word, turn on the Macro Virus Protection Option in Tools, then Options, then Security Tab and finally\nMacro Security button, by setting the level of security you desire for the macros.. This will warn you if files\ncontain macros. You or a colleague may have created the macros for some legitimate purpose but they could\nalso be viruses. If a warning appears, open the file only it comes from a trusted source. Note that this procedure\nwill warn you about macros (whether malicious or benign) but will not disinfect existing infected files.\nVirus Detection\nSeveral types of antiviral software can be used to detect the presence of a virus. Scanning software can\nrecognize the characteristics of a virus(cid:146)s computer code and look for these characteristics in the computer(cid:146)s\nfiles. Antivirus software packages provide complete protection against viruses. Other types of antiviral software\ninclude monitoring software and integrity-shell software. Monitoring software is different from scanning\nsoftware. It detects illegal or potentially damaging viral activities such as overwriting computer files or\nreformatting the computer(cid:146)s hard drive.\nCOMPUTER SECURITY\nThese are techniques developed to safeguard information and information systems stored on computers.\nPotential threats include the destruction of computer hardware and software and the loss, modification, theft,\nunauthorized use, observation, or disclosure of computer data.\nI Simple Techniques: A variety of simple techniques can help prevent computer crimes, such as protecting\ncomputer screens from observation, keeping printed information and computers in locked facilities, backing\nup copies of data files and software, and clearing desktops of sensitive information and materials.\nIncreasingly, however, more sophisticated methods are needed to prevent computer crimes. These include\nusing encryption techniques, establishing software usage permissions, mandating passwords, and installing\nfirewalls and intrusion detection systems. In addition, controls within application systems and disaster\nrecovery plans are also necessary.\nII Backup: Storing backup copies of software and data and having backup computer and communication\ncapabilities are important basic safeguards because the data can then be restored if it was altered or destroyed\nby a computer crime or accident. Computer data should be backed up frequently and should be stored nearby\nin secure locations in case of damage at the primary site. Transporting sensitive data to storage locations\nshould also be done securely.\nIII Encryption: Another technique to protect confidential information is encryption. Computer users can\nscramble information to prevent unauthorized users from accessing it. Authorized users can unscramble the\ninformation when needed by using a secret code called a key. Without the key the scrambled information\nwould be impossible or very difficult to unscramble. A more complex form of encryption uses two keys,\ncalled the public key and the private key, and a system of double encryption. Each participant possesses a\nsecret, private key and a public key that is known to potential recipients. Both keys are used to encrypt, and\nmatching keys are used to decrypt the message. However, the advantage over the single-key method lies with\nthe private keys, which are never shared and so cannot be intercepted.\nIV Approved Users: Another technique to help prevent abuse and misuse of computer data is to limit the use of\ncomputers and data files to approved persons. Security software can verify the identity of computer users and\nlimit their privileges to use, view, and alter files. The software also securely records their actions to establish\naccountability. Military organizations give access rights to classified, confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation according to the corresponding security clearance level of the user. Other types of organizations\nalso classify information and specify different degrees of protection.\nV Passwords: Passwords are confidential sequences of characters that allow approved persons to make use of\nspecified computers, software, or information. To be effective, passwords must be difficult to guess and\nshould not be found in dictionaries. Effective passwords contain a variety of characters and symbols that are\n18\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nnot part of the alphabet. Another advantage of this password is because it is case sensitive (i.e. Advent is\ndifferent from advent). To thwart imposters, computer systems usually limit the number of attempts and\nrestrict the time it takes to enter the correct password.\nVI Firewalls: Computers connected to the communication networks such as internet are vulnerable to electronic\nattack because many people have access to them. They can be protected by firewalls computer software\nplaced between the networked computers and the networks. The firewalls examines filters and reports on all\ninformation passing through the network to ensure its appropriateness. These functions help to prevent\nsaturation of input capabilities that might otherwise deny usage to legitimate users.\nVII Intrusion Detection Systems: These are software that detect unusual and suspicious activities and in\nsome cases, stop a variety of harmful actions.\nBASIC COMPUTER MAINTENANCE\nMAINTENANCE\nOne of the most common questions computer users ask is, (cid:147)How do I maintain my computer and keep it\nrunning great?(cid:148) A computer is a lot like a car...it costs more than you think it should, it starts going down in\nvalue as soon as you bring it home and it requires regular maintenance to keep it running smoothly.\nTo properly deal with repairable systems, we need to first understand how components in these systems\nare restored (i.e. the maintenance actions that the components undergo). In general, maintenance is defined as\nany action that restores failed units to an operational condition or retains non-failed units in an operational state.\nFor repairable systems, maintenance plays a vital role in the life of a system. It affects the system(cid:146)s overall\nreliability, availability, downtime, cost of operation, etc. Generally, maintenance actions can be divided into\nthree types: corrective maintenance, preventive maintenance and inspections.\nPreventive Maintenance\nPreventive maintenance is the practice of replacing components or subsystems before they fail in order to\npromote continuous system operation. The schedule for preventive maintenance is based on observation of past\nsystem behaviour, component wear-out mechanisms and knowledge of which components are vital to continued\nsystem operation. Cost is always a factor in the scheduling of preventive maintenance. In many circumstances,\nit is financially more sensible to replace parts or components that have not failed at predetermined intervals\nrather than to wait for a system failure that may result in a costly disruption in operations.\nHere are a few basic guidelines required.\nI Surge Protection: Power surges, spikes, lightning and brown - outs are all things that can literally burn up\nyour computer and its peripherals. Save yourself lots of money in repairs by buying a decent surge protector\n(a.k.a. Power strip) for your computer and use it. A UPS (uninterruptible power supply), though slightly\nmore expensive, is even better.\nII Anti-Virus Protection: Everyone should know about this by now, but we often see computers with either\n(cid:147)no virus protection at all, or anti-virus software that is badly out-of-date(cid:148). Nothing can wreck your\ncomputer faster than a virus (except for may be electricity), but with a small investment in good anti-virus\nsoftware and making sure you set it to update itself daily.\nIII Minimize the number of Software you install: This is another thing many people overlook. Installing lots\nof programs on your computer is a lot like pulling a bunch of rowdy children together on a playground.\nSome of them may not play well together. A good rule of thumb is (cid:147)if you don(cid:146)t need, don(cid:146)t install. This is\nespecially true when you surf the web. You will likely get bombarded with pop-up ads trying to get you to\ninstall all kinds of flee utilities they claim your computer can(cid:146)t live without most of these are spyware,\nadware and junk.\nIV Backup your important files: To minimize the potential of loosing important information, always make a\n19\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nbackup of your crucial files. To do this, you can use a CD-burner, a backup tape system, or a removable disk\ndrive (such as a Jazz, Zip, floppy or flash drive). Keep copies of these backups in another location, just in\ncase you need to perform a disaster recovery.\nV Firewall Protection: Symantec(cid:146)s Norton personal Firewall keeps personal data in and hackers out. Right out\nof the box, it makes your PC invisible on the Internet so that hackers can(cid:146)t find it. The program(cid:146)s Intelligent\nIntrusion prevention technology blocks suspicious Internet traffic. And easy-to-use privacy controls prevent\npersonal information from being sent out without your knowledge.\nVI Internal\/External Component Cleaning: Dust is one of the leading causes of hardware failure. All moving\ncomponents are thoroughly cleaned and lubricated during service visits. The case is opened and dust is\nremoved from the motherboard and all system boards. The CPU fan, power supply fan and any other board\nfans are cleaned, lubricated and tested. All data cables are checked to be sure they are securely heated on\nsystem boards. CD and floppy drives are opened, cleaned and tested for data transfer. External components\nsuch as keyboard, mouse, monitor and printers are cleaned of dust and debris and all cable connections are\nchecked. Connections to surge protectors or UPS are checked.\nVII Scan and defragment your hard drive on arrive: Your hard drive stores information in open areas of\nyour hard drive. As you delete data on your drive, open space appears. The computer will utilize this open\nspace to store new information. Sometimes information for a particular file or application is separated on a\ndrive into several different locations. The totality of the information may not fit in the open space in one\narea, so the computer will divide the information into several pieces. When you scan and defragment your\nhard drive, you are minimizing the risk of having problems and (cid:147)slowdowns(cid:148) caused by separated data on\nyour hard drive. The defragmentation will locate, delete open spaces and place associated files back together\nagain, helping your computer to run smoothly and faster. To do this, Right-Click on the\ndrive\uf0e8Properties\uf0e8Tools Tab\uf0e8Defragmentation section\uf0e8Defragment now\uf0e8select the drive\uf0e8Analyze\nOR Defragment\nDisk Defragmenter\nDisk Defragmenter is a system utility for analyzing local volumes (an area of storage on a hard disk. A volume\nis formatted by using a file system, such as FAT or NTFS, and has a drive letter assigned to it. You can view the\ncontent of a volume by clicking its icon in windows Explorer or in My Computer. a single hard disk can have\nmultiple volumes, and volumes can also span multiple disks) and locating and consolidating fragmented files\nand folders. You can also defragment (Defragmentation is the process of rewriting parts of a file to contiguous\nsectors on a hard disk to increase the speed of access and retrieval. When files are updated, the computer tends\nto save these updates on the largest continuous space on the hard disk, which is often on a different sector than\nother parts of the file. When files are thus fragmented, the computer must search the hard disk each time the file\nis opened to find all of the file(cid:146)s parts, which slows down response time) disks from a command line using the\ndefrag command. The best practices for fragmenting a volume are enumerated below.\n\uf0b7 Analyzing before defragmenting\nAnalyze volumes before defragmenting them. After analyzing a volume, a dialog box tells you the\npercentage of fragmented files and folders on the volume and recommends whether to defragment the\nvolume. Analyze volumes regularly and defragment them only when Disk Defragmenter recommends it. A\ngood guideline is to analyze volumes at least once a week. If you seldom need to defragment volumes,\nanalyze volumes monthly instead of weekly.\n\uf0b7 Analyzing after large numbers of files are added\nVolumes might become excessively fragmented when users add a large number of files or folders, so be\nsure to analyze volumes after this happens. Generally, volumes on busy file servers should be defragmented\nmore often than those on single-user workstations.\n20\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\n\uf0b7 Ensure that your disk has at least 15% free space\nA volume must have at least 15% free space for Disk Defragmenter to completely and adequately\ndefragment it. Disk Defragmenter uses this space as a sorting area for file fragments. If a volume has less\nthan 15% free space, Disk Defragmenter will only partially defragment it. To increase the free space on a\nvolume, delete unneeded files or move them to another disk.\n\uf0b7 Defragmenting during low-usage periods\nDefragment file server volumes during low-volume usage periods to minimize the effect that the\ndefragmentation process has on file server performance. The time that Disk Defragmenter takes to\ndefragment a volume depends on several factors, including the size of the volume, the number of files on the\nvolume, the number of fragmented files, and available system resources.\n\uf0b7 Defragmenting after installing software or installing Windows\nDefragment volumes after installing software or after performing an upgrade or clean install of Windows.\nVolumes often become fragmented after installing software, so running Disk Defragmenter helps to ensure\nthe best file system performance.\nDefrag\nAt times, it might be difficult to even select the drive to be defragmented; hence the use of command line.\nLocates and consolidates fragmented boot files, data files, and folders on local volumes.\nSyntax\ndefrag volume; defrag volume [\/a]; defrag volume [\/a] [\/v]; defrag volume [\/v]; defrag volume [\/f]\nParameters definitions\nVolumeThe drive letter or a mount point of the volume to be defragmented.\n\/a Analyzes the volume and displays a summary of the analysis report.\n\/v Displays the complete analysis and defragmentation reports.

When used alone, displays both the analysis and defragmentation reports.\n\/f Forces defragmentation of the volume regardless of whether it needs to be defragmented.\n\/? Displays help at the command prompt.\nRemarks\n\uf0b7 A volume must have at least 15% free space for defrag to completely and adequately defragment it. Defrag\nuses this space as a sorting area for file fragments. If a volume has less than 15% free space, defrag will\nonly partially defragment it. To increase the free space on a volume, delete unneeded files or move them to\nanother disk.\n\uf0b7 You cannot defragment volumes that the file system has marked as dirty, which indicates possible\ncorruption. You must run chkdsk on a dirty volume before you can defragment it. You can determine if a\nvolume is dirty by using the fsutil dirty query command.\n\uf0b7 While defrag is analyzing and defragmenting a volume, it displays a blinking cursor. When defrag has\nfinished analyzing and defragmenting the volume, it displays the analysis report, the defragmentation report,\nor both reports, and then exits to the command prompt.\n\uf0b7 By default, defrag displays a summary of both the analysis and defragmentation reports if you do not\nspecify the \/a or \/v parameters.\n\uf0b7 You can send the reports to a text file by typing >filename.txt, where filename.txt is a file name you specify.\nFor example: defrag volume \/v >filename.txt\n\uf0b7 To interrupt the defragmentation process, at the command line, press CTRL+C.\n21\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\n\uf0b7 Running the defrag command and Disk Defragmenter are mutually exclusive. If you are using Disk\nDefragmenter to defragment a volume and you run the defrag command at a command-line, the defrag\ncommand fails. Conversely, if you run the defrag command and open Disk Defragmenter, the\ndefragmentation options in Disk Defragmenter are unavailable.\nFormatting legend\nFormat Meaning\nItalic Information that the user must supply\nBold Elements that the user must type exactly as shown\nEllipsis (...)

Corrective maintenance is performed at unpredictable intervals because a component(cid:146)s failure time is\nnot known at prior. The objective of corrective maintenance is to restore the system to satisfactory operation\nwithin the shortest possible time. Corrective maintenance is typically carried out in three steps:\ni. Diagnosis of the problem. The maintenance technician must take time to locate the failed parts or\notherwise satisfactorily assess the cause of the system failure.\nii. Repair and\/or replacement of faulty component(s). Once the cause of system failure has been\ndetermined, action must be taken to address the cause, usually by replacing or repairing the components\nthat caused the system to fail.\niii. Verification of the repair action. Once the components in question have been repaired or replaced, the\nmaintenance technician must verify that the system is again successfully operating.\nSystem Diagnosis\nThe diagnosis practice is usually called troubleshooting. Much of the troubleshooting guide treated here\ncaters for users of Windows operating systems.\nAlways keep detailed records of all errors and steps taken to correct these errors. Error numbers and\ncodes are important to log. They tell technicians\/network administrators specific information about the\nproblems you are having. To document errors, press the (cid:147)Details(cid:148) button or simply write down the first couple\nof lines of information given in the error screen.\nCheck all cables first. The most frequent problem with computers is a loose or disconnected cable. Don(cid:146)t\nbe afraid to make mistakes. Don(cid:146)t let the machine intimidate(cid:146) you. Before calling an expert for technical\nsupport, always shut your computer down totally and reboot; wait until the CPU is not making any sounds and\n22\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nthen turn it on again, by pressing the power button.\n1. Booting Problems\nWhen you press the power button, you give the instruction to the electricity to \"wake\" up the computer. This\ninstruction causes the computer to start giving its own instructions to internal parts. One of the instructions is\ncalled BIOS. The BIOS instruction starts checking \"everybody\", asking \"Are you OK?\", \"Are you OK?\", \"What\nabout you?\". If a certain part that is important doesn't respond (for example if a certain important object such as\nthe keyboard or mouse is not connected, which means it will not respond when the BIOS asks, \"Are you OK?\"),\nthen the BIOS may interrupt everything, or it may continue checking. If the BIOS comes to a conclusion that\nthis computer is not worth using, it would display an error and may not let you do anything significant. If the\nBIOS \"thinks\" that everything is alright and that the computer can be used, then it gets the hardware parts ready.\na. I am receiving an error that says, (cid:147)Invalid system disk, replace and press any key when ready: This error is\ncaused by the presence of a floppy disk in the floppy drive while the computer is booting up. Whenever\nyou turn your computer on, remember to eject all disks from the floppy drive (unless a (cid:147)bootable(cid:148) floppy\ndisk). If you get this error, eject the floppy disk and hit enter. Your computer should continue to boot as\nnormal.\nb. Receiving a keyboard related error: This error occurs when the keyboard has become unattached from the\nrear of the computer. Check behind the computer to see if your keyboard is still firmly attached to the\ncomputer. Also check to see if something has been pressing on top of the keyboard during booting. Remove\nall items that are pressing keys and re-plug the keyboard into the computer. Restart your computer.\nc. I am receiving a (cid:147)no signal(cid:148) error, or (cid:147)there are no visuals on my monitor(cid:148): A (cid:147)no signal(cid:148) error means\nthat the monitor is .not receiving a signal from the computer. Check to see if the computer is on and\nrunning. Then check the connection (cord) between the computer and the monitor. If everything is\nconnected, turned on, and running, then there might be an internal error causing this(cid:146) error to occur.\nContact a technician for assistance\nd. Scan disk appears on a blue screen, stating that Windows was not properly shut down: Scan Disk is a\nutility that Windows runs automatically when it thinks there might be a problem with your system. This\ndoes not mean that there is a problem, but Windows will automatically take this step to ensure that the\nproblem is rectified. Let Scan Disk run and wait, to see if your machine will boot properly after scan disk is\ncomplete. If it does not, turn the computer off, and reboot to see if the problem clears up on its own. If\nrebooting the computer does not solve the problem, contact your technician.\n2. Safe Mode Problems\nIf your computer boots to a screen giving you a choice to boot into safe mode, or it automatically boots into\nsafe mode, Windows has run into an error that it cannot bypass to run smoothly. In most cases, you can\nreboot and the problem will resolve itself automatically. If you continue to get the safe mode screen, or it\ngoes away and comes back frequently, then contact your technician. .\n3. The system is ON but it Is not responding\nMy system is locked and nothing I press or click is working. What now? Sometimes your computer will\nstop responding, or (cid:147)freeze(cid:148), either during operation or after unused for a period of time. If the computer has\nnot been used recently, press a few keys and wait several minutes. If the computer (cid:147)freezes(cid:148) during\noperation, stop using the keyboard and the mouse for several minutes. If you continue to use the computer\nwhen it is (cid:147)frozen(cid:148), it will prolong your waiting period. If, after waiting for several minutes, you cannot get\nyour computer to respond by using the keyboard or the mouse, turn the computer off by pressing the(cid:148) power\nbutton on the front of the machine. Let the computer shutdown (the CPU is no longer making any sounds)\nand then reboot. If you still get no response from the machine, your mouse and keyboard may have become\ndislodged from the rear of the machine, check those connections and reboot again. If the computer freezes\nagain after plugging the mouse and keyboard into the back of the computer and rebooting, contact your\ntechnician.\n4. Rebooting Problems\na. Windows won(cid:146)t shut down, it stays at the (cid:147)please wait(cid:148) screen, or won(cid:146)t power down: This is a problem\n23\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nwith the way Windows is talking to your computer. The computer wants to suspend activity, but Windows\nis telling it to shut down. This is causing confusion for the computer. In some cases, this can be solved\nwith a patch from the Microsoft web site. A patch is an update to a software product that fixes a known\nproblem. You can get this update by downloading it from www.Microsoft.com. Windows 98 generally has\na problem with shutting down, especially when the computer is attached to a network. Generally, this\ndoesn(cid:146)t hurt anything. It is just a bit of a nuisance. See (cid:147)Booting Problems(cid:148) on what to do during\nsubsequent reboots.\nb. A window pops up with (cid:147)End Task,(cid:148) (cid:147)Shut Down,(cid:148) and (cid:147)Cancel(cid:148) buttons, what do I do? This message\nusually appears when you press and hold (cid:147)Control(cid:148), (cid:147)Alt(cid:148), and (cid:147)Delete(cid:148) while running an application or\nprogram. This keystroke tells the computer to shut itself down, despite the fact that applications are\nrunning. If you would like to turn off the computer without manually closing or saving anything, click the\n(cid:147)Shut Down(cid:148) button. If you would like to close just the program you are running currently, ensure that the\ncorrect program is highlighted in the box and click (cid:147)End Task.(cid:148) If this window was opened accidentally,\nclick (cid:147)Cancel(cid:148) and you will return to the program you were just using.\nc. An internal error or (cid:147)KernaI32(cid:148) error box appears suggesting that I restart Windows: This error has\noccurred because Windows has come across an error that it cannot continue with. If something like this\nhappens and you are in the middle of your work, try to save your work before you click (cid:147)OK(cid:148). If your\nwork caused the error to occur, everything, after the last time you saved your work, will be lost. Restart\nyour computer. Remember to always document errors thoroughly. Misbehaving software often causes\nthese errors. If the error occurs repeatedly, call for assistance from your technician.\n5. Monitor Problems\nMy monitor has no display, the monitor turned off for no reason, or my display is faded: Ensure that the\nmonitor and the computer are turned on. Next, check both the power cord to the monitor and the power cord to\nthe computer. If you are using a power strip, ensure that it is turned on. You can also check the settings on your\nmonitor (the buttons are located on the lower front of the monitor). Check the contrast and tint to see if they are\nset correctly. Next, check the connection between the monitor and computer; at the rear of the computer (this is\nthe cord that connects the monitor to the computer). The next thing to check is your screen saver settings. Right\nclick on your desktop\uf0e8Properties or you can click Start\uf0e8Settings\uf0e8Control Panel\uf0e8Display (display settings\ndialog box will appear) \uf0e8Screen Saver tab. Make sure your screen saver is set to go off in a reasonable amount\nof time (usually 10 minutes or more). Also, make sure your (cid:147)Energy Savings(cid:148) settings are marked correctly.\nYou can locate the energy savings settings button in the Screen Saver box, near the bottom. When you click on\n(cid:147)Settings(cid:148), you will be able to adjust the amount of time that your computer waits to turn off the monitor if the\ncomputer is not in use. If you don(cid:146)t ever want the monitor to be shut down by the energy saver mode, choose\n(cid:147)Never.(cid:148) If all these things don(cid:146)t fix the problem, contact a technician.\n6. Monitor flashes on and off\nUsually this is caused by a loose or bad connection at the back of your computer. You should be able to re-\ntighten the connection, and continue as normal. If that is not the problem, then it needs to be diagnosed by a\nprofessional.\n7. Mouse Problems\na. My mouse is sticky and\/or the cursor won(cid:146)t move Check to see if your mouse cord is pulled too tightly. If\nyour cord doesn(cid:146)t have enough room to maneuver, then you will have less control over it. Next, check the\nmouse(cid:146)s connection to the back of the CPU and ensure that it is plugged in. If neither of these possibilities\nwere the problem, you may need to clean the ball on the inside of the mouse. You can flip over the mouse\nand take the ball out by twisting the round disc that holds it in place (turn the round piece in the direction\nof the arrows). Once you have taken out the ball, clean the ball off with a clean, dry, and lint-free cloth.\nNever use water on any computer part! Put the mouse back together again. If that doesn(cid:146)t fettle problem, it\nmight be time to replace the mouse.\nb. My mouse won(cid:146)t right click, or won(cid:146)t double click: Press Ctrl-Alt-Esc and use the arrow key up to get to\n24\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nShutdown, and then choose reboot. This should fix the problem, if not a technician should look at the\nmachine.\n8. Keyboard Problems\na. I am receiving a keyboard error when booting my computer: This is usually caused by a key being pushed\ndown while the computer starts. Make sure nothing is on top of the keyboard during boot time. Also this\ncould be caused by the keyboard becoming disconnected from the back of the computer. If neither of these\nare the problem, contact your technician.\nb. My Keyboard won(cid:146)t respond at all: If your computer has (cid:147)frozen(cid:148) and the keyboard will not respond at all,\nthe first thing to do is to check the keyboard connection to the computer and restart the computer. If your\nkeyboard still does not respond, you may need technical assistance.\n9. Printer Problems\na. The printer won(cid:146)t print my document: Check the printer to make sure it is plugged in and turned on. Click\nStart\uf0e8Settings\uf0e8Printers. If the printer you want to use is not listed, you will have to install that printer.\nYou can do this by clicking (cid:147)Add Printer(cid:148) and following the installation process through to completion. If\nthe printer appears light or grayed-out, your printer is offline. Double-click on the printer in question, then\nclick (cid:147)Printer(cid:148) and uncheck (cid:147)Pause Printing(cid:148) and (cid:147)Use Printer Offline(cid:148) or Right-Click the printer and\nselect Online. Next, make sure that you have chosen the correct printer. You can check this by going back\ninto the file you were trying to print and click on File\uf0e8Print. The name of the printer will appear near the\ntop of that window next to (cid:147)Name(cid:148). If the correct printer does not appear in this box, click on the down\narrow to the right of the name of the printer being used. Find your printer(cid:146)s name and highlight it by\nclicking the left mouse button on it. Once you have ensured that the correct printer is chosen and that the\nprinter is not offline or paused, ensure that you are logged onto the network. To do this, click Start and\nlook to see if your logon name is listed after (cid:147)Log Off(cid:148). If your logon name is not there, you need to log\nback onto the network. To start this process, ensure that you have saved your work. Then, click\nStart\uf0e8Log Off. This will bring up a dialog box. Click (cid:147)Yes.(cid:148) You will be prompted to enter your name\nand password to log back onto the network. Once you finish this, click (cid:147)Ok(cid:148) or (cid:147)Enter.(cid:148) Open your file\nagain and try to print it. If you still cannot print, please call a technician.\nb. Documents come out faded or striped: This is usually due to dirty or clogged print heads, or the printer\nbeing out of ink. Try running a print-head cleaning utility to clean the heads. Most printers come with this\nto help with dirty or clogged heads. Do this by going to Start\uf0e8Settings\uf0e8Printers, and then right clicking\non the printer in question. Try cleaning the heads, and then print a page. If you still get fades or stripes, try\nit once more. If after two times your pages are still coming out faded or striped, then you may need to\nreplace the ink. If, however, the ink is not an issue, you should contact a professional.\nc. I am receiving an (cid:147)out of memory(cid:148) error or a spooter error: This is caused when the machine that the\nprinter is connected to runs out of memory, or has an internal error. This usually happens because of large\nprint jobs. If you get this error frequently you might want to consider upgrading the memory on the\ncomputer with the printer attached to it. It can also be caused by lack of free disk space. Check to see if\nyou have enough free space. To do this, double click on My Computer\uf0e8Right-Click (cid:147)C(cid:148)\nDrive\uf0e8Properties. The free space should be listed on that screen. If you only have a couple of megabytes\nor less, that could be your problem. You will need to either clean up your drive or replace it with a bigger\ndrive. Call a technician to help with either of these processes. If you have adequate disk space, try\nuninstalling and then reinstalling the printer. To do this, Click Start\uf0e8Settings\uf0e8Printers\uf0e8Right-Click on\nthe printer in question and select (cid:147)Delete.(cid:148) You want to remove it completely from the system. Then click\n(cid:147)Add Printer(cid:148) and reinstall the same printer. If it was used across a network make sure you reestablish the\n(cid:147)share(cid:148) with the same name. This can be done by right clicking on the printer and choosing (cid:147)Share This\nPrinter(cid:148).\n10. CD-Rom Issues\na.

Make sure the volume levels are turned up and that none of the\ncontrols are muted. Next, look at the back of the computer where the speakers plug in. If there is a volume\ncontrol there, make sure it is turned up. Then check to see if the speakers are plugged into the correct jack\nfor audio out. There are usually three jacks on the back of a sound card plug as appropriate. Next, we want\nto open the CD player application by clicking Start\uf0e8Programs\uf0e8Accessories\uf0e8Entertainment\uf0e8CD\nPlayer. If the application will not open, you will need to reinstall the CD player application of the\nWindows CD. You can do that by going into Start\uf0e8Settings\uf0e8Control Panel\uf0e8Add\/Remove\nPrograms\uf0e8Windows Setup\uf0e8Multimedia\uf0e8Details. You should see the (cid:147)CD Player(cid:148) checked (if it is not,\ncheck it and click ok and then apply), uncheck it and click Ok. Then click (cid:147)Apply,(cid:148) but don(cid:146)t shut the\npanel. We now need to go back to (cid:147)Multimedia(cid:148) and recheck the (cid:147)CD Player,(cid:148) click (cid:147)Ok,(cid:148) and then click\n(cid:147)Apply(cid:148) again. If this was not the issue, contact your technician.\nb. I am receiving a (cid:147)CD ROM is not accessible(cid:148) error: Check to see if you have placed the CD you want to\nread in the CD ROM drive. Pick up the CD and check to see if it is dirty, or scratched. If your CD is clean\nand fully inserted in the drive, try to read from the drive again. You can also insert another CD into the\ndrive and try to read the new CD. Some (cid:147)burned(cid:148) CDs cannot be read by certain CD R0M drives. If your\nissue goes unresolved, call a professional for assistance.\nInspections\nInspections are used in order to uncover hidden failures (also called dormant failures). In general, no\nmaintenance action is performed on the component during an inspection unless the component is found failed,\nin which case a corrective maintenance action is initiated. However, there might be cases where a partial\nrestoration of the inspected item would be performed during an inspection. For example, when checking the\nmotor oil in a car between scheduled oil changes, one might occasionally add some oil in order to keep it at a\nconstant level.\nAbout Backups\nA backup is a copy of your file, made in case you lose or damage the original. For those using system in offices\nor at home, it will be necessary to follow a strict backup regime, using floppy disks or ZIP disks, Flash drives\nand other secondary memory devices. A zip disk is like a floppy disk except that it hold 70 times as much\ninformation: obviously useful for graphics and multimedia projects. A flash drive can hold larger information\nthan a ZIP drive.\nBe Disciplined\nIt requires discipline from the user for a backup strategy to work. Make backups at the end of every day or\nevery week depending on how much work you do and how important the data is. To make backups of\nindividual files, copy them to disk using Explorer or My Computer. Note that you can also copy entire folders\nwith this method. Alternatively, open the file and use the Save as option in the application perhaps the most\nconvenient method is to make a copy of the Zip or floppy disk, using Copy Disk.\nDon(cid:146)t work directly with backup files (i.e. Zip\/floppy disk), you work on the hard disk and thereafter\ncopy to a ZIP or floppy disk. We cannot stress enough just how important it is to make backups, horror stories\nexist when people loose months or years of work. Unfortunately even people, who know they should make\nbackups, tend not to bother until they have been stung. So follow the advice in this book and be an exception to\nthis tendency!\n26\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nWORKING WITH DESKTOP\nFigure 4: Window(cid:146)s Desktop Figure 5: Display Properties Dialog Box\nThe computer(cid:146)s interface uses a (cid:147)desktop(cid:148) metaphor. The desktop is the coloured background you see\non the screen when you start your computer (this may vary for different computer since it is customizable). It is\nthe place where you manipulate the work you are doing by handling icons (a little pictures that represent your\nfiles, folders, and disks). It summarises the systems properties by enabling you to have access to all these\nproperties. It serves as an intermediary between the system and the user.\nThe desktop elements include the icons, the taskbar (Start Menu, Taskbar and the System Tray)\nwallpaper and screen saver. The icons are images, pictures, symbols, or logos that represent items on the\ndesktop. For instance, the desktop above has 30 icons. An icon may represent an application, a file, a folder, a\nshortcut or even a location on the hard drive. The taskbar is the horizontal (by default) bar placed separately on\nthe desktop but will never appear on the screen saver. The wallpaper represents the picture used as the desktop\nimage. It is the placeholder for the icons (i.e. the icons are placed on it). The screen saver is the animated\npicture shown instead of the wallpaper when the system is idle for some time. It differs from wallpaper in that it\ncan(cid:146)t harbour the icons.\nThere are two entities that mainly need to interact with icons:\n\uf0b7 As a person using the computer, icons allow you to familiarize with the various programs that are installed\nin a computer. Every application or every category of application has its own icon. This is easily possible\nbecause every person who creates an application has the possibility of providing a special icon for that\nparticular application.\n\uf0b7 The operating system also has an interior mechanism to identify an icon or a type of icon and associate it\nwith a particular application or a series of applications of the same type. Microsoft Windows ships with\nvarious icons for its own use. For example, every version of Microsoft Windows ships with a special icon\nfor the My Computer program. There is also a special icon for Recycle Bin, etc.\nThe sizes of icons are standardized and they should not have just any random dimensions. For example,\nthe icons on the desktop are 32x32 pixels. Sometimes, the icons display in a 16x16 dimension.\nYou can customize your desktop(cid:146)s elements using the Display Properties Dialog box (shown above)\nwhich can be accessed by either Right-Clicking the desktop\uf0e8Properties or Start\uf0e8Control Panel\uf0e8Double-\nClick on Display. This window will enable you to change the appearance of your desktop, such as the\nbackground (wallpaper), screen saver, colours, font sizes, and screen resolution. Use the various tabs to change\nthe various properties.\n27\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nYou can also right click any section of the taskbar and select Properties to customize it. This will display\nthe Taskbar and Start Menu Properties Window where you can select the Tab you need as the case may be. To\ncustomize the System tray section, Click the Customize button on the Taskbar Tab of the window.\nWORKING WITH WINDOWS\nWorking with (cid:147)windows(cid:148) gives you the ability to (cid:147)look at(cid:148) something. It allows you to look into a\ndocument, or a folder, or a disk. When you begin using your PC, you will be confronted with the desktop,\nwhich is simply the term used for the space on your screen. When you want to run a particular application, you\nneed to load the package (launch). To do this depends on the location of the package.\na. Desktop\ni. Click its icon\/ press Enter\nii.

Each action is stored in a particular program\nand kept under a button or a menu. A program's menu, simply referred to as a menu, is a series of words usually\naligned on a (vertical) column, each line of words indicating a particular action.\nFor any window you open, what is common to all packages is the title bar.\nThere are different types of windows we will encounter when working with the computer. Some of them\ninclude a dialog box, a Single Document Interface (SDI), and a Multiple Document Interface (MDI).\nDialog Boxes\nA Dialog Box is a square or rectangular window whose main role is to carry, hold, or host, other\nwindows. The objects it carries define its role and name. A dialog box is made of two main sections. On top, it\ndisplays a Title Bar (with the title and System Close Button). By convention, a dialog box cannot be minimized\nor maximized. Therefore, it doesn't have those system buttons. Sometimes, a dialog box will have a button with\na question mark (the Help button). A dialog box equipped with the Help button indicates that you can get quick\nhelp on the items displayed on the dialog box. The second section of a dialog box is its body (programmers call\nit the Client Area). This is the area where the objects the dialog box is hosting are positioned. Examples\ninclude the Save As Dialog Box and the Open Dialog Box in most applications.\nFigure 7: A Typical Dialog Box (The Run Dialog Box)\nThe Single Document Interface (SDI)\nThis is a window that allows the user to work on only one opened document at a time. It is similar to a typical\nwindow. An example is the WordPad\nThe Multiple Document Interface (MDI)\nThis is similar to the SDI except that you can work on more than one document at a time. An example is the\nMicrosoft Word.\nThe Windows Controls\nThe controls on a window refer to the objects that are available on the window. There are various controls to\ninclude Command buttons, Text boxes, List boxes, Option (Radio) buttons, Check boxes, Combo boxes, Scroll\nbars, Progress Bar, etc. For all the objects that may be present on a window, only one of them can receive focus\nat a time. The focus is a visual aspect that indicates that a control is ready to receive input from you. Various\ncontrols have different ways of expressing that they have received focus. Button-based controls indicate that\nthey have focus by drawing a dotted rectangle around their text. In the following picture, the button on the right\n29\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nhas focus. A text-based control indicates that it has focus by displaying a blinking cursor. A list-based control\nindicates that it has focus when one of its items has a surrounding dotted rectangle.\nTo give focus to a control, you can click it. Alternatively, if the focus is already on one of the controls, to give\nfocus to a particular control, you can press Tab continuously until the control shows that it has focus. On a\nbrowser, if you press Tab continuously, the focus would move from one link or control to another. This means\nthat a link on a web page can receive focus as if it were a control.\nMain Menu Display\nWe have just seen that, when you know where a menu is available, to access it, you can just click or\nright-click the item that holds the menu. How a menu appears can be influenced by the available room. The\noperating system decides on the availability of room to display the menu. If a menu is accessed from the middle\nto top section of a window, the operating system would display it under the item that was clicked. If the menu is\nbeing accessed from the bottom section of the screen, the operating system would calculate the available room\nunder the item that was clicked. If there is enough room, the menu would be displayed under the item that was\nclicked. If there is not enough room, then the operating system would decide to display the menu above the item\nthat was clicked\nCategories of Menus\nTo diversify the actions that can be performed on a computer, there are six main categories of menus, each of\nwhich depends on the person who created the menu.\na) Stand-Alone Items: The simplest menu item displays a word or a group of words on its line. To use this\nmenu type, you can simply click it. What happens depends on the program and the familiarity with it.\nExample is the Refresh menu on most browsers.\nb) Disabled Menu Items: If a menu appears gray, this means that the menu is not available at this time. Such a\nmenu is said to be disabled. Clicking a disabled menu would not do anything, at all. Most of the time, such a\nmenu would require a prerequisite action in order to become available or enabled.\nc) Ellipsis Menus ((cid:133)): A menu with three periods indicates that an intermediary action is required. To use\nsuch a menu, click it. Once clicked, sometimes another window would be displayed. Example is the Save\nAs (cid:133) option of the file menu in several windows.\nd) Check Menus: A menu that appears with a check mark is used as a \"witness\" of a window object being\navailable or not. This means that, when the check mark is set, the object the menu item refers to is visible. If\nyou click such a menu item, the check mark disappears along with the item it refers to; the menu item is still\nvisible: only its check mark and the item it refers to disappear.\ne) Radio Menus: Some menu items appear in a group of two or more (usually not more than 7). The group is\ndelimited by a horizontal line above the top menu item and another horizontal line below the bottom object.\nAt any time, one of the menu items has a big round dot on its left side. This dot is called a radio button. The\nitem that is currently active has the radio button and the other menu items don't. If you click an item other\nthan the one with the radio button, the dot moves to the item you clicked and the previous item looses the\nradio button. This type of menu is used when the programmer wants only one item of the group to indicate\nwhich item of a category is active.\nf) Arrow Menus: When a menu appears with an arrow, this means that the menu item holds its own list,\ncalled a submenu. Again, this design depends on the person who created the menu and is not subject to any\npreconceived rule. To access the menu item, simply position the mouse cursor on the menu item that has the\narrow. How the submenu appears may depend on the section of the screen from where the menu is being\naccessed. The operating system decides how to display this submenu based on the available room.\n30\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nMain and Context-Sensitive Menus\nWe have seen that a menu on the same object can be different depending on what item you click to\naccess such a menu. Based on this, a menu that appears when you simply click an object is considered the\nregular menu of the object, and it is simply called the menu. Sometimes when you click or even right-click an\nobject, a menu might not appear. On the other hand, if a menu appears when you right-click an item or an area\nof a window, this menu is referred to as the context-sensitive menu.\nMost applications display a menu in their top section, the Main Menu, below the Title Bar. The main\nmenu displays columns of menus, each column is represented by a word (sometimes it will be more than one\nword for a menu item). To use this main menu, you can click a word. This causes a list of menu items to\ndisplay. There are no strict rules (only suggestions) on what items must appear under what word. The person\nwho creates an application also decides on the menu columns, their items, and their roles.\nAfter clicking a menu column, if you find the item you are looking for, you can click it. If you don't see\nthe item you are looking for and you want to check another column, you have two options. You can simply\nmove the mouse to another menu column of your choice. You can also click the menu item you had opened,\nthen click the new column you desire. If you still don't see what you are looking for, you can dismiss the menu.\nThere are various ways you can dismiss the menu if it is opened. If you click an item in the list of the\ndisplayed column, the menu would retract and close itself. If you have opened a menu but don't want to use it\nanymore, you can click one of the menu items on top. You can also click anywhere other than the opened menu;\nthis also closes the menu.\nTo access or close the menu using the keyboard, use Alt + the Access Key (underlined letter on the\nmenu) for the menu. Once this is initiated, you just press the access key for each command under the main\nmenu. To dismiss a displayed menu, press the Esc key. You can also use the navigation keys to move from\nmenu to menu (Left and Right Arrows) or down a menu using the Up and Down Arrows.\n\uf0d8 The Control\/System Buttons (located at the top right corner of a window)\ni. Minimize button: Click this to reduce the programs to a button on the Taskbar.\nii. Restore\/Maximize button: This switches the window size between full-screen size (docked window) and\nHalf-Window (or customized) size (floating or cascade window). You can also double-click the empty\nspace of the title bar to toggle between the options.\niii. Close button: Click this to dispense with the window until the next time you open the program. If the file\ninside the window has not been saved, it will prompt you to save it.\nYou can also access any of the actions by clicking the application logo or right-clicking the empty space of the\ntitle bar and then select the action you want.\n\uf0d8 Moving Windows\nIf a window gets in the way of what you are doing, you can move it to a different place on the screen by\nclicking and holding the Title bar using the Left Mouse button (only possible for floating window).\nYou can change a windows shape or size so that you can see more of its contents or so that you can\narrange windows side-by-side manually. This is possible when the window is restored down. Place the mouse\nover the edge of the window so that the mouse pointer changes shape to a double-pronged arrow (either side or\nedge), drag inwards or outwards to reduce or enlarge the window (default Restored).\n\uf0d8 Splitting Window\nThis is usually done when you want to compare different places of a particular document. For instance,\nview pages 50 and 350 of a particular document at the same time. To do this, select Window\uf0e8split; the cursor\n31\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nwill change to a horizontal line which you will click at the desired location. You can work on each of them as if\nyou are dealing with a single window. To remove Window\uf0e8Remove split.\n\uf0d8 Arranging Windows\nFor a particular document, more than one window can be opened simultaneously. To do this, select\nWindow\uf0e8New Window. The new window will change the name of the document by adding index. The name\nwill be like Filename:index_number e.g. Adebisi:1 while the second name will be Adebisi:2. You can add as\nmany as you want. You can now arrange the window using Window\uf0e8Arrange All. This will arrange the\nwindows horizontally. To change the arrangement to side-by-side, select Window\uf0e8Compare Side by Side. To\nchange to horizontal, select Window\uf0e8Close Side by Side.\nNote that these two procedures may seem similar in that both are used for comparing a document in different\nwindows. Thus, the major differences are:\ni. Splitting windows does not use name index; both bear the same name.\nii. Splitting windows has only one title bar and toolbars while each window in New Window has its own title\nbar and toolbars.\niii. Splitting windows can only be viewed horizontally whereas New Windows can be viewed in two ways\n(either horizontal or vertical).\nTo arrange windows of different documents, Right-Click on the taskbar \uf0e8 Choose either Cascade\nwindows (all windows restored), Tile Windows Horizontally, Tile Windows Vertically, or Show the Desktop\n(all windows minimized).\n\uf0d8 The Taskbar\nThe taskbar appears at the bottom of the screen and displays all the programs that are currently open. When you\nminimize a window, it still appears as a button on the taskbar. Click the program button on the taskbar to restore\nit to a window. By selecting different program buttons on the taskbar, you can switch easily between currently\nopen programs or press Alt + Tab key or WIN + Tab key + Enter.\n\uf0d8 The status bar\nThe status bar, which is a horizontal area at the bottom of the document window (e.g. in Microsoft Word) which\nprovides information about the current state of what you are viewing in the window and any other contextual\ninformation. To display the status bar, click Tools\uf0e8Options\uf0e8View tab\uf0e8select the Status bar check box\nunder Show. The elements on the status bar for the above window include the following.\ni. Page number: Shows the page number.\nii. Sec number: Shows the section number of the page shown in the window.\niii. Number\/number: Shows the page number and the total number of pages based on the physical page count\nin the document.\niv. At measurement: Shows the distance from the top of the page to your insertion point. No measurement is\ndisplayed if the insertion point is not in the window.\nv. Ln number: Shows the line of text where the insertion point is located. No measurement is displayed if the\ninsertion point is not in the window.\n32\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nvi. Col number: Shows the distance, in number of characters, from the left margin to the insertion point. No\nmeasurement is displayed if the insertion point is not in the window.\nvii. REC: Shows the macro recorder status. Double-click REC to turn the macro recorder on or off. When the\nrecorder is off, REC appears dimmed.\nviii. TRK: Shows the track changes status. Double-click TRK to turn the Track Changes feature on or off.\nWhen changes are not being tracked, TRK appears dimmed.\nix. EXT: Shows the extend selection mode status. Double-click EXT to turn the mode on or off. When\nselection mode is off, EXT appears dimmed.\nx. OVR: Shows the overtype mode status. Double-click OVR to turn the mode on or off. When overtype\nmode is off, OVR appears dimmed.\nxi. Spelling and Grammar: Shows the spelling and grammar checking status. When Word is in the process of\nchecking for errors, an animated pen appears over the book. If no errors are found, a check mark appears.\nIf an error is found, an (cid:147)X(cid:148) appears. To resolve the error, double-click this icon.\nxii. Background save: When a pulsating disk icon appears, Word is saving your document in the background\nas you work.\nxiii. Background print: When a printer icon appears, Word is printing your document in the background as you\nwork. A number next to the printer icon shows the current page number being printed. To cancel the print\njob, double-click the printer icon.\nNote that the status bar are grouped into sections: Page (i, ii, and iii), Measurement (iv, v, vi), while others\nshows the current status of the commands.\nUSING THE SYSTEM (BOOTING\/SHUTTING DOWN)\nTurning the system ON (Booting) is very easy. It only requires you to press the On Button once. This button is\nusually the upper button in front of the system console. Before doing this, you must ensure that power supply\nhas entered into the power supply unit. To enforce this, switch on the UPS, turn the console box ON if there is\nON\/OFF button at the back of the box (optional).\nShutting down has many options. The settings in the Shut Down Windows dialog box include Stand by,\nHibernate, Shut down, Restart, Log off, and Disconnect. To display the Shut Down Windows dialog box, click\nStart\uf0e8Shut Down. Stand by and Hibernate appear only if your computer supports these features and you have\nturned them on in Power Options. Disconnect appears only if you are connected to a Windows Server running\nTerminal Services. On Windows 2000 Server products, you will be prompted to supply information regarding\nwhy you are shutting down or restarting the computer. This feature is turned off in Windows XP.\nStand by mode: A state in which your computer consumes less electric power when it is idle, but remains\navailable for immediate use. Typically, you put your computer on standby to save power instead of leaving it on\nfor extended periods. In standby mode, information in computer memory is not saved on your hard disk. If the\ncomputer loses power, the information in memory will be lost. This option appears only if your computer\nsupports this feature and you have selected this option in Power Options.\nHibernate: A state in which your computer saves any Windows settings that you changed, writes any\ninformation that is currently stored in memory to your hard disk, and turns off your computer. Unlike shutting\ndown, when you restart your computer, your desktop is restored exactly as it was before hibernation.\nShutdown: A state in which your computer saves any Windows settings that you changed and writes any\ninformation that is currently stored in memory to your hard disk. This prepares your computer to be turned off.\n33\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nRestart: A state in which your computer saves any Windows settings that you changed, writes any information\nthat is currently stored in memory to your hard disk, and then restarts your computer.\nLog off: A state in which your computer closes all your programs, disconnects your computer from the\nnetwork, and prepares your computer to be used by someone else. When connected to a Windows 2000 Server\nrunning Terminal Services, Log off closes all programs running in your Terminal Services session, disconnects\nyour session, and returns you to your Windows desktop.\nDisconnect: A state in which your Terminal Services session is disconnected, but remains active on the server.\nWhen you reconnect to Terminal Services, you are returned to the same session, and everything looks exactly as\nit did before you disconnected.\nMake sure that you always shut the system down in the normal way, else you are hastening to destroy the\nsystem especially when you are using Window XP.\nINTRODUCTION TO THE INTERNET\nComputer Network (Networking and Internetworking)\nUntil recently, getting a computer was mostly equivalent to getting a machine that would be used to\nperform office-related assignments and other calculations. This type of computer was commonly referred to as\nstandalone. A network is a group of computers linked together so that they can share resources such as\nprinters, software programs and documents. Computer network is the interconnectivity of autonomous\ncomputers. In order for two computers to share what they have, they must establish some type of\ncommunication. This is easily done using a cable and an appropriate object (a network card, also called NIC)\ninserted in each computer. This means that a cable would go from this object of one computer to the same type\nof object on the other computer. This is perfectly possible to connect two computers. If you have more than two\ncomputers, then you use a type of intermediary object whose job is to \"direct traffic\". This object is called a\nhub. For example, when one computer A requests to use or open a piece of text that is located in a computer B\nbut to print it in a printer that is connected to a computer C, this intermediary object is able to know what\ncomputer has the text, what computer has the printer, and what computer needs these two services. For these\nreasons, most connections use this intermediary object: the hub\nThere are two types of networking relationship: computer workstations (clients) are connected to a\nnumber of central network servers, which allocate resources. In a peer-to-peer relationship, computer\nworkstations serve each other: one workstation may have access to a printer and allocates this resource to others\nin the network; another may have access to file storage and allocates this to others (including the workstation\nwith the printer).\nFigure 8: Connection of Computers using the Hub\n34\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nOnly computers that are connected can share what they have. A computer A that is connected to a\ncomputer B can access what computer B has. When two or more computers are connected, the idea is to let\nthem share and exchange what they contain. If the computers are small, like regular desktop computers, they\nmay become overwhelmed and they may not have enough to share. The next step is to have a \"bigger\" central\ncomputer that holds even more things that other small computers would need (the word big here doesn't\nnecessarily mean that this computer is physically big; it implies that this computer can do more things, for\nexample it can perform more and faster calculations, than the other small computers). Such a central computer\nis called a server, because its job is to serve other computers (these other small computers are then called\nworkstations):\nAs information and resources (things to share) became more and more useful and in demand, servers of\ndifferent companies started establishing types of connections among themselves, of course following some\nrules. In fact, in some situations, some big computers (servers) were made simply to provide information to\nother computers, without needing to know who owned these small computers, why these small computers\nneeded this information, or what to do with them. The internet was born.\nThe Internet is a group of big computers connected to share the information they hold. Some of these\ncomputers belong to the government, schools (mostly universities), big companies (corporations), small\ncompanies and some to individuals. The computers that are connected may not have anything at all in common.\nTo make sure that this communication is possible, a few rules (called protocols) were established so that\nanybody who wants to make his or her information available to other people through the Internet must follow\nthese rules, no matter what he or she does with the server or computer.\nThe rules to make a server available on the Internet are numerous and complicated. Therefore, another\ntype of computers was created that allows casual users to get on the internet without knowing, or being\ninterested to know how these servers communicate. These new intermediate computers are held by companies\ncalled service providers (they are the middle man). When you have a computer and want to get on the internet,\nyou use an Internet Service Provider (ISP) who will establish the connection for you and will make sure that\nyour computer can get on the Internet. Based on this, the Internet can be illustrated as follows:\nFigure 9: The internet\n35\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nThe advantages of using a network are:\na) Data and information sharing\nb) Resources sharing such as a printer, even if they are not physically connected.\nc) Reliability and security\nd) You can use email\ne) You can access the internet\nTYPES OF NETWORKS\nIn describing the basics of networking technology, it will be helpful to explain the different types of networks in\nuse.\nLocal Area Networks (LANS)\nA net work is any collection of independent computers that exchange information with, each other over a shared\ncommunication medium. Local Area Networks or LANs are usually confined to a limited geographic area, such\nas a single building or a college campus. LANs can be small, linking as few as three computers, but can often\nlink hundreds of computers used by thousands of people. The development of standard networking protocols\nand media has resulted in worldwide proliferation of LANs throughout business and educational organizations.\nThere is another advance LAN called the Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), used when we consider the\ndistance covered to be between 1 to 10km unlike the LAN that spans within 1km.\nWide Area Networks (WANS)\nOften elements of a network are widely separated physically. Wide area networking combines multiple LANs\nthat are geographically separate. This is accomplished by connecting the several LANs with dedicated leased\nlines such as a T1 or a T3, by dial-up phone lines (both synchronous and asynchronous), by satellite links and\nby data packet carrier services. WANs can be as simple as a modem and a remote access server for employees\nto dial into, or it can be as complex as hundreds of branch offices globally linked. Special muting protocols and\nfilters minimize the expense of sending data over vast distances.\nWireless Local Area Networks (WLANS)\nWireless LANs, or WLANs, use radio frequency (RF) technology to transmit and receive data over the air. This\nminimizes the need for wired connections. WLANs give users mobility as they allow connection to a local area\nnetwork without having to be physically connected by a cable. This freedom means users can access shared\nresources without looking for a place to plug in cables, provided that their terminals are mobile and within the\ndesignated network coverage area. With mobility, WLANs give flexibility and increased productivity,\nappealing to both entrepreneurs and to home users. WLANs may also enable network administrators to connect\ndevices that may be physically difficult to reach with a cable.\nIntranet: A Secure Internet-Like Network for Organizations\nWith advancements in browser-based software for the Internet, many private organizations have implemented\nintranets. An intranet is a private network utilizing Internet-type tools, but available only within that\norganization. For large organizations, an intranet provides easy access to corporate information for designated\nemployees.\n36\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nExtranet: A Secure Means for Sharing Information with Partners\nWhile an intranet is used to disseminate confidential information within a corporation, an extranet is commonly\nused by companies to share data in a secure fashion with their business partners. Internet-type tools are used by\ncontent providers to update the extranet. Encryption and user authentication means are provided to protect the\ninformation, and to ensure that designated people with the proper access privileges are allowed to view it.\nHISTORY OF THE INTERNET\nMore than just a technology, the Internet has become a way of life for many people, and it has spurred a\nrevolution of sorts for both public and private sharing of information. The most popular source of information\nabout almost anything is on the Internet as used daily by technical and non-technical users alike. With the\nmeteoric rise in demand for connectivity, the Internet has become a major communications highway for\nmillions of users. It is a decentralized system of linked networks that are worldwide in scope.\nThe development of computers and advances in the ability to link up several computer units within the same\nvicinity called the Local Area Network (LAN) and in remote locations called Wide Area Network (WAN)\nprepared the ground for the emergence of this powerful and awesome phenomenon which is known as Internet\n(INTERnational NETwork). The internet is a global network of computers linked together by telephone lines,\nmicrowave and satellite links to form a large single information pool. It is the most advanced, sophisticated and\nfastest growing information system available today.\nThe internet was as a result of some visionary thinking by people in the early 1960s who saw great potential\nvalue in allowing computers to share information on research and development in scientific and military fields.\nJ.C.R. Licklider of MIT, first proposed a global network of computers in 1962, and moved over to the Defense\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency (DAPGA) in late 1962 to head the work to develop it. Leonard Kleinrock\nof MIT and later UCLA developed the theory of packet switching, which was to form the basis of internet\nconnections. Lawrence Roberts of MIT connected a Massachusetts computer with a California computer in\n1965 over dial-up telephone lines. It showed the feasibility of wide area networking, but also showed that the\ntelephone line(cid:146)s circuit switching was inadequate. Kleinrock(cid:146)s packet switching theory was confirmed. Roberts\nmoved over to DARPA in 1966 and developed his plan for ARPANET.\nThe internet, then known as ARPANET, was brought online in 1969 under a contract led by the renamed\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which initially connected four major computers at universities in\nthe Southwestern US (UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UCSB, and the university of Utah). The contract was\ncarried out by BBN of Cambridge, MA under Bob Kahn and went online in December, 1969.\nIn the 1970s, Arpanet grew, but in 1984, the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the US government built its\nown network research called the NSF net. Other US government agencies such as NASA followed and got their\nown networks. As the network grew, different internet domains were generated and standardized. They are com\nfor commercial institutions, edu for education, gov for government, mil for military, net for network operations\nand services, org for nonprofit organizations while some are used for countries like za for South Africa ca for\nCanada, ng for Nigeria, fr for France, sa for Saudi Arabia and uk for United Kingdom, etc.\nIn 1993 the National Science Foundation, who had been running the network pulled out and the Net became\nopen to anyone, anywhere.\n37\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nWhy the Internet?\nThe Internet is a fast, easy way to communicate. An email message can be sent anywhere in the world to any\nnumber of people and can arrive within minutes. Documents, pictures, sounds and video clips can be sent to\nanyone with internet access anywhere in the world. Software such as shareware packages, demos of commercial\npackages and games can be accessed. An enormous range of knowledge and data useful for research can be\nsearched for and shared. Other advantages include News group (group on the internet that share news with one\nanother about matters that interest individuals which range from commercial, business, sports, medical, etc.),\nInternet teleconference (people on the net that conduct real life discussion by typing your own contribution that\nothers can read and reply), online training and learning (e.g. GRE, TOEFL, etc.), e-registration (e.g. WASSCE,\nNECO, JAMB, NYSC, etc.) and e-commerce\/business.\nProtocols (Rules of Networking)\nInformation is shared on the Internet by means of protocols. Protocols are rules that are followed by computers\nas standards of communications that allow them understand each other. Transferring data in the form of files is\none of the most common uses of the internet. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is one of the most popular method\nused for file transfer through the internet. The reason for its popularity is that it has the capability to transfer\nfiles between different types of computer. Computers that store information that can be transferred via FTP are\ncalled FTP servers. Those that store information that can be accessed by anybody are called anonymous servers.\nSome require a specific user name and password to login.\nTable 3: Protocols\nAcronym Full Name Purpose\nFTP File Transfer Protocol For transferring files\nSMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol For sending email\nPOP,IMAP Post Office Protocol, Interactive Mail Access Protocol For accessing email\nMIME Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions For enhancing email-\nespecially for attachments\nHTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol Used to transfer web pages\nThe World Wide Web\nDeveloped by CERN in Geneva in 1990, the World Wide Web (www), also known as the web changed the face\nof the Internet to the extent that people mistakenly think the terms Internet and Web are synonymous. This\nhypertext system allows text, sound, video and pictures to be put on one page of information. These pages can,\nand often do, contain links to other pages whose source can be located anywhere in the world. The Web has\nmade the internet much more user friendly and, as such infinitely more popular. It has brought about a time\nwhen anyone with the necessary resources can gain better access to information (to use the web to locate, read\nand download document stored on computer systems around the world). The Web is cross-platform, i.e. the\nsame information can be viewed regardless of the type of computer you use. On the web however, the document\nare presented as a series of pages commonly known as web pages that are linked together to form a web site.\nA web browser, such as Netscape, has the ability to enable access to many different forms of Internet\ndistribution: FTP, the Web, Newsgroup and mail all through one application.\n38\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nWeb Server Addresses\nWeb pages that are accessible to all on the Internet are stored on special computers called as web server. Each\nweb server is assigned a unique address e.g. www.state.gov.ng. Typically web addresses start with www. The\nname of the site is the name of the organization or person whose pages we are trying to access while (cid:147)type of\nsite(cid:148) is a two or three characters code indicating the nature of work.\nDomain Names\nA Domain Name is the name by which an individual or organization chooses to be known on the Internet. It is\nneeded for email addresses and for the names of servers connected to the Internet. Once registered it is\nrecognized throughout the world and cannot be used by anyone else. The uniqueness of a domain name is\ncrucial to the working of the Internet because it ensures that email names and web addresses can(cid:146)t be\nduplicated. See the following table to see how domain names are used:\nTable 4: Domain Names\nName Type Example\nDomain name City.ac.uk\nPersonal name Bilbo Baggins\nUser ID Ab123\nEmail Ab123@city.ac.uk or b.baggins@city.ac.uk\nWebsite server www.city.ac.uk\nPersonal web space http:\/\/www.student.city.ac.uk\/~ab123\nUnix CPU Server Swindon.city.ac.uk\nEmail Clients\nThere are special mail programs available to compose, receive and send mail. They are referred to as email\nclient as they reside on the user(cid:146)s computer and are used to communicate with the email server. Email client\nalso offer other facilities like maintaining an address book of email addresses that make emailing very simple.\nExamples are Outlook express, Eudora etc.\nElectronic Mail (E-mail)\nThis is a popular resource on the Internet for sending and receiving information. It represents a large portion of\nall Internet traffic and is for many the only Internet resource they use. It can be use for business and personal\ncorrespondence and exchange of information. Just like normal mail, addresses are required for the exchange of\nemail. Everyday person who wishes to use or receive email must have an email address. When a user applied\nfor an email address, an account referred to as his email address is created for him on the email server. All email\naddressed to him is received into this account. Email accounts are password protected, thus preventing other\nusers from accessing the mail. There are various companies or web sites that provide free email addresses that\nyou can use at your convenience and that allow you to access your messages from any computer connected to\nthe internet. Some of these companies are Yahoo, Netscape, Hotmail, Google, etc.\nThe email address is of this format username@domainname.com: The username is the identity of the user\nwhose account it is. The symbol @ separates the Username and the domain name. The domain name is the\nunique name given to the email server e.g. pacific.com. Domain name have two components. Thus pacific is the\nname of the Organization while com is the type of organization (e.g. net, org, etc.). this is also referred to as the\nUniform Resource Location (URL)\n39\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nNews Group\nNewsgroup allow for group discussion on specific topic. Some newsgroup focus on buying and selling, health,\nstamp collection, romance, politics etc. There are thousand of newsgroups, once a user gained access to\nnewsgroup site there is no cost to subscribe to them. For example imagine that someone has joined a newsgroup\ninvolved in stamp collecting, as new message about this hobby are sent by other subscribing to his group the\nmessage become available to the newcomers. This person review not only what someone has sent to the\nnewsgroup but also what others have written in response.\nFile Sharing and Topic Searching\nOne of the original Internet goal was global information sharing. File could be transfer between internet users\nlocated at different part of the globe within minutes. Search sites or search engines (e.g. yahoo, msn, ask,\ngoogles, etc.) can be used to locate resources on the internet. The user simply supplies a word or a phrase, the\nsite then replies with a list of internet locations where the information can be found. Generally, the search is free\nand only takes a few seconds.\nBrowsers\nA browser is a computer application that \"understands\" the languages (called protocols) of the internet used to\nview web pages. Examples include Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, Mosaic, e.t.c. Browsers that only\nshow textual information are called Text Based Browsers e.g. Lynx, Alynx, edbrowse (Line-mode browser),\nELinks, Emacs\/W3, Net-Tamer, w3m, and WebbIE. They make it easy to pick and follow links by selecting\nappropriate highlighted text. Graphical web browsers allow the user to just point and click to access\ninformation. They have the capability to support hypermedia i.e. sounds, movies, formatted text, and graphics.\nThe most popular of graphical browsers are Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, and Mosaic.\nA browser is a window object made of five main sections: Title Bar, Menu bar, Toolbar, Address bar, and the\nviewing area.\nThis is a table of personal computer web browsers by year of release of major version, in chronological order.\nYear Web Browsers\nPre-browser: HyperCard, Gopher\n1991 Worldwide Web\n1992 ViolaWWW, Erwise, MidasWWW, MacWWW\n1993 Mosaic, Cello, Lynx 2.0, Arena, AMosaic 1.0\n1994 IBM Web Explorer, Netscape Navigator, SlipKnot 1.0, MacWeb, IBrowse, Argo, Minuet\n1995 Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator 2.0, OmniWeb, WebRouser, Internet Explorer 2, Grail\n1996 Arachne 1.0, Internet Explorer 3.0, Netscape Navigator 3.0, Opera 2.0, PowerBrowser 1.5,\nCyberdog, Amaya 0.9, AWeb, Voyager\n1997 Internet Explorer 4.0, Netscape Navigator 4.0, Netscape Communicator 4.0, Opera 3.0\n1998 Internet Explorer 5.0 Beta 1, iCab, Mozilla, Opera 4\n40\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\n1999 Amaya 2.0, Mozilla M3, Internet Explorer 5.0\n2000 Konqueror, Netscape 6, Opera 4, Opera 5, K-Meleon 0.2\n2001 Internet Explorer 6, Galeon 1.0, Opera 6\n2002 Netscape 7, Mozilla 1.0, Phoenix 0.1, Links 2.0\n2003 Opera 7, Safari 1.0, Epiphany 1.0\n2004 Firefox 1.0, Netscape Browser, OmniWeb 5.0\n2005 Safari 2.0, Netscape Browser 8.0, Opera 8, Epiphany1.8, Amaya 9.0, AOL Explorer1.0, Maxthon\n1.0, Shiira 1.0\n2006 SeaMonkey 1.0, K-Meleon 1.0, Galeon 2.0, Camino 1.0, Firefox 2.0, Avant 11, iCab 3, Opera 9,\nInternet Explorer 7, Sputnik\n2007 Maxthon 2.0, Netscape Navigator 9, NetSurf 1.0, Flock 1.0, Safari 3.0, Conkeror\n2008 Konqueror 4, Safari 3.1, Opera 9.5, Firefox 3, Amaya 10, Flock 2, Google Chrome 1\nRC Internet Explorer 8\nBeta Safari 4, Camino 2\nAlpha Opera 10, SeaMonkey 2, Google Chrome 2\nWeb Site\/Web Page\nA web page is an area of text and other fancy visual effects that you see when you get on the internet (actually it\nis a file but we haven't learned yet what a file is). A web site is a group of web pages that belong to one section\nof the internet, such as one person, one company, one school, or one government agency, etc (a web site is\nsimilar to a folder or directory but we haven't learned what a folder or directory are).\nWhen you get on the internet, you actually access one or different web pages from one or different web sites. To\naccess a web page, you must first get to the web site to which the web page belongs and you must know the\nname of the web page. The combination of a web page and the web site it belongs to is called its address. To get\nthe address of a web page, you have four main options:\n\uf0b7\nIf you know the web site that published the web page, you must first go to that web site. To do this, after\nopening the browser, in the address box, you can type the (complete) address of the page\n\uf0b7\nIf you have already been to that web page before, you may have book marked it. In this case, you can\n\"recall\" the web page using the main menu of the browser or a button on the browser\n\uf0b7\nIf somebody sent you the address, on the document (such as an email) that was sent to you, you may just\nclick the address that was sent to you (called a link) and the browser would automatically open the web\npage\n41\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\n\uf0b7\nIf you are already on the internet and perform a search, the page that allowed you to do the search will\npresent you with the address (called a link) of the page. You can just click it and you would be taken to\nthat web page\nA Link\nA link is a word or a sentence that, when clicked, would lead you to a web page or produces an internet-related\naction. Because a link is meant for the internet, it is usually displayed in a different color although this depends\non the person who created the link. There are two main ways you get a link:\n\uf0b7\nSomebody may send it to you as a reference or an indication\n\uf0b7\nIf you are already on the internet, you may see some words or sentences that coincidentally all display in\nthe same color\nThe color of the link is not really what makes it a link. It is the result of what it produces that makes it a link. To\ndistinguish a link from the other text on a document or a web page, when you position your mouse on it, the\nmouse pointer usually changes into a closed hand with a pointing finger. A link can also be created on a picture.\nTo indicate that a picture holds a link, when you position your mouse on it, the pointing finger cursor appears.\nSearch Engines\nAlthough the internet is highly rich with information, that information is not always organized the way you\nparticularly expect. When \"browsing\", you may find it hard to get the particular information you want. To\nprovide an alternative, there are some specialized sites that can perform the search for you, with more or less\naccuracy. These sites are referred to as search engines. Some of the most popular of them are Google.com,\nYahoo.com, Alexa.com, MSN.com, Netscape.com, Altavista.com, and Search.com.\nTo do a search, first access a search engine site. Each one of them provides you with a convenient box in which\nyou can type the word or sentence to search and press Enter. After a few seconds, the results would be displayed\nin a list. You can then click each link and check it. Most of the search engine sites provide more services than\nsearching the web. For example, both Yahoo and MSN provide free email addresses and the ability to check\nyour email messages. Some of them also allow you to look for a job, a relationship. Most of them allow you to\nshop. Many of them also provide news, etc.\nEven though the internet simplifies accessing information, its vastness makes it a little difficult to find relevant\ninformation quickly. To make searching easier, search engines were developed. They are software on the web\nthat help internet users to look for specific information. Search engines usually refer to websites that are used to\nsearch for data on the web. They search for information on the web on the basis of certain keywords specified\nby the user. The result of the search is a list of documents that contain the keywords. However, the list of found\ndocuments could be long, to narrow down the search; there are several options that can be applied. E.g. putting\nthe phrase in quote, the plus and the minus sign.\nUse the plus sign when you want to find articles that contain all of the words you enter. Example, to find article\non rock and roll music, just type rock + roll + music. Use the minus sign to limit your results to articles with\nonly the words you want. Example, if you want articles about pets, but you are not interested in dogs, just type\npets-dogs. Do not leave any space between the signs (+, -) and the word you want to leave out.\nPhrase it: Search for ideas and concepts instead of just word, using more than one word in your search. To find\ncomplete phrase, just put quotes around the words that you want to find together. For example, to find\ninformation on the small scale Business, type(cid:148) Small Scale Business(cid:148) (in quotes). Using quotes tells the search\nengines to look for that exact phrase.\n42\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nDownloading\nDownloading is the ability to get something from the internet and put it in your computer. By default,\ndownloading means that you decide when to get that thing. Unfortunately, some things get into your computer\nwhile using the internet. Some of these things don't bother your computer; some others do. This is why you\nshould be restrictive with the sites you visit.\nBy default, sites of big corporations, government agencies, and schools are less harmful, almost not harmful\nbecause they are more accountable or more responsible. In fact, most responsible or accountable businesses run\nsites that are not harmful at all (you are extremely unlikely to get a disease, I mean a virus, from the web site of\na big corporation or a government agency).\nLike everything else in life, the internet was abused and is now the source of some bad behaviors. There is no\nstrict list of things you should do or sites you should not visit. So, welcome to this world of the Internet.\nBecause of bad behaviors some people and corporations have witnessed on the internet, if you work for some\ncorporations or government agencies, or if you are accessing the internet using a public or school's computer,\nyou may not be able to just download anything you want, and these decisions are right (if you want to download\nharmful things, do it at home or using your own computer; create your own bad experience, be your own victim,\nlearn from your own mistakes; don't do it on someone else's computer. This means that, if a school, an agency, a\nbusiness, or a corporation prevents you from using the Internet any way you want, it is a valid decision they\nmake and you should live with it).\nMany big corporations offer free and safe things you can download (big corporations are more responsible and\naccountable; they can't take the risk of having their name dragged to the mud). For example, if you plan to get\ninto programming, you can check offerings from , , or Dev-\nhttp:\/\/www.sun.com\/ http:\/\/www.borland.com\/\nC++. I didn't cite , not because I hate the company (I don't) but because most of its free offerings I can\nMicrosoft\nremember may be installed in your computer already, such as Internet Explorer, Microsoft Works (which is not\nreally free, it is just that if you buy your computer in a store, it may have Microsoft Works already but if you\ndon't have Microsoft Works and you nee it, you would have to purchase it) or the .NET Framework (the .NET\nFramework is not really free and it is not a program by itself anyway, it is a library whose job is to complete the\noperating system; fortunately, while doing that, it comes with free programs for programmers, not for casual\nusers).\nChat or Internet Teleconference\nChat allows group of people to send messages to one another immediately in real time, once connected with a\nlarge number of other users form all around the world. Chat rooms are created in such that feature a particular\ntheme, such as romance, politics, fictions, science, movies, sport etc. All the messages typed within a chat room\nappear almost simultaneously on the computer screens of all participants for that chat room.\nA chat room is much like a party of people mingling and talking at the same general time, except that are typing\nshort messages instead.\nTelnet\nThis is a program that is designed to allow user to log into another computer on the internet as a user on that\nsystem. With this, a user can log into a server to access information stored on it. However, the only those users\nthat have been allowed access by the organization can login to the server. Organizations make use of the telnet\nto make a part of their system available to outsiders.\n43\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nDISADVANTAGES OF USING COMPUTER\nThe importance of computer cannot be overemphasized but there are lots to it than neglecting its demerits.\nAlthough, this aspect may be viewed based on where you are located in the world.

Although it may appear as a waste of time, it absolutely is not.\nIn fact, you should invest in learning it.\nIf you are taking a class at an institution, the school may (should) provide equipment to you to learn\nkeyboarding. If you are on your own, you can go to a computer store and purchase software that would guide\nyou with keyboarding. There are many sites that provide good lessons on keyboarding. On a search engine web\nsite, do a search on \"keyboarding\". Check different sites to see what they offer. Besides, sites change all the\ntime. The features to look for are that: the early lessons should show you how to position your fingers, the early\nlessons should start on the middle characters, for QWERTY keyboard, these should be asdf;lkjg and h.

At this point, any\nwork done need to be preserved for future reference. Hence, either when we closed the application or shut down\nthe computer, all our valuable work will be gone. Most of the time, after creating something using an\napplication, you may want to keep it for later reference. You may even want to give or send it to someone else.\nFile processing consists of creating something on a computer and keeping it. The thing you keep is called\ninformation or datum. The plural of datum is data. In some cases, the word data can be used in both singular and\nplural forms. There are various issues related and different techniques used to keep data.\nA medium is an object used to hold information in a computer. The plural of medium is media. There are\nvarious kinds of them.\n1. Internal Hard Drives\nThe primary object used to hold information in a computer is called the hard drive:\n48\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nFigure 10: A Typical Hard Drive\nEverything (data) in your computer is stored in the hard drive. The hard drive is a rectangular box that contains\nsome discs and other parts. The information stored in a hard drive is written on its discs. The information can be\nwritten to, erased from, copied or moved among discs. Although you will perform these operations, the\noperating system is in charge of deciding how the operations are carried out inside. You will not need to know\nwhat is going on inside.\nThe hard drive is inside of the computer, connected to another wide flat object called the motherboard, using\ncables. This type of hard drive is referred to as internal and this the most classic type.\nWhen you purchase a computer, it already has a hard drive. Later on, you can either add a second one to your\ncomputer or replace the hard drive in your computer.\n2. External Hard Drives\nUntil recently, the hard drive was traditionally thought of as a piece of hardware inside the computer. For this\nreason, it couldn't be carried away easily: you had to open the computer, disconnect the cables, and then remove\nthe hard drive. Even then, some other issues were related (such as the type of cable, etc) so much that people\nwere not in the habit of carrying a hard drive from one computer to another. Fortunately, another technology\nwas developed to use another type of hard drive that stays outside the computer and it is referred to as external.\nAn external hard drive is usually connected to the computer using a cable to a port (USB) outside the computer.\nWhat makes it valuable is that, by simply disconnecting its cable, an external hard drive can easily be carried\nfrom one computer to another. And because the external hard drive doesn't have the same particularities of\ncables (IDE vs SATA), it can easily be connected to almost any common computer (PC). The external hard\ndrive is fairly easy to install. You primarily connect a (USB) cable from the back of the hard drive to a (USB)\nport on the computer. In most cases, it should be ready to install (Plug n' Play) or it may quickly install the\nsoftware (driver) it needs to function. In some cases, after inserting the cable and turning the device on, a\nwindow may come up asking you to install something (a driver), which you would also have received from the\nmanufacturer. Install it and continue to use the drive.\n3. Internal CD Drives\nOne of the problems with external hard drives is that, sometimes they can be heavy (not too heavy but still).\nAnother problem is that, to use them on another computer, you must have the right cable and you must\nphysically connect them. The remedy to this is to use an object that holds its information but can be ready by a\nrecognizable drive. A CD drive is an object that can be used to store information on a disk called a compact disc\n(CD). It is also connected similar to that of the internal hard drives.\n4. External CD Drives\n49\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nWe also have another type of CD drive that stays outside the computer called an external CD drive. This type is\nusually connected to the computer through an external port (USB). Here is an example:\nFigure 11: An External CD Drive\nLike the internal hard drive, the CD drive uses a round disc to store its data. While the hard drive holds its own\nmany discs inside, the CD drive doesn't actually have a disc. You insert the disc when you think it necessary,\nand you can insert only one disc. The CD drive can read regular data but it can also play CD music.\nIn early days, the CD drive was used only to read the data on a disc. Most CD drives nowadays are also used to\nwrite to a disc. They are called CD writers or CD burners. As such, the CD writer can be used to both read\nfrom, and write to, a disc.\n5. Internal DVD Drives\nAs you can expect, the CD has some limitations. For example, it can hold only a specify amount of information\nand it can play only music. To overcome some of its limitations, there is the DVD (Digital Video Disc) drive.\nThis drive looks like the CD drive and they have the same dimensions.\n6. External DVD Drives\nThere is also an external DVD drive. Like the hard and the CD drives, the external DVD drive connects to the\ncomputer using a (USB) cable connected to a port on the computer.\n7. Flash Drives\nA flash drive is a small drive that can be used to hold data.\nTo use it, you insert its metallic side in a USB port on the computer. Once\nyou do, it turns itself on and a window may come up asking you what you\nwant to do. In some cases, the drive would need to install something (a\ndriver) for it to work.\nFigure 12: The Flash Drive\n8. Memory Cards and Card Readers\nThe function of a memory card is similar to that of a flash drive except that the card needs a reader for it to be\nuseful. You would buy them separately and insert the memory card into the card reader which is invariably\nconnected to the computer via the USB port.\n50\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nSIMPLE DISK MANAGEMENT\nWhen a drive has been installed in the computer or inserted on a port, the operating system must recognize it.\nOnce it does, for a computer that runs Microsoft Windows, it assigns a letter to it. In Windows Explorer or\nMy Computer, a drive is represented by a letter. Here are examples:\nFigure 13: Window Explorer showing the drives on a Computer\nEach letter, in this case A, C, D and E represents a drive. In some cases, a letter may not represent a real drive\nphysical drive (it may represent a partition among many partitions on the same hard drive). To distinguish a\nletter of a drive from letters of normal words, the letter of a drive is always followed by a colon \":\". In\nWindows Explorer or My Computer, the letter of a drive is also included in parentheses.\nIn most cases, you should accept the letters, In some cases, you may need to change them. For example, if\nyou insert a flash drive, you hear a sound that the computer has recognized it, but the content of the drive\ndoesn't show, or the drive letter is not (automatically) assigned (by the operating system). The problem could\nbe that the letter the operating system attempted to assign to the drive is already taken but the operating\nsystem didn't attempt to assign another letter.\nTo manage the letters of the drives, you can open the Computer Management MMC. To do this, you can\nright-click My Computer \uf0e8 click Manage \uf0e8 in the left frame, click Disk Management. One of the actions\nyou can perform here consists of changing a drive letter. To do this, you can right-click a drive letter in the\ntop-right frame or a section in the lower-right frame \uf0e8 click Change Drive Letter And Paths... This would\nopen a dialog box that you can use to change the letter.\nDOCUMENTS\nWhen you open an application, such as a text editor, it displays an empty area with a blinking caret. In the same\nway, if you open a graphics application or a spreadsheet, it also displays an empty area, waiting for your work.\nYou can then start performing the type of assignment that the application is expecting. For a graphics\napplication, you can start drawing or loading pictures. For a spreadsheet, you can start entering numbers and\nperforming calculations. When you start entering text in a text editor or a word processor, you are said to create,\nor work on, a document. If you start drawing shapes or manipulating pictures in a graphics application, you are\nsaid to work on a document. If you start entering numbers and performing calculations in a spreadsheet, you are\nsaid to work on a document.\n51\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nSaving a Document\nAfter creating a document, you may want to preserve it for later use. Preserving a document is referred to as\nsaving it. You have many options and this may depend on the application you are using. In most cases, if an\napplication was created using the standards described and recommended by Microsoft, to save the document, on\nthe main menu, click File \uf0e8 Save:\n\uf0b7\nIf the document was never saved before, a dialog box would come to assist you\n\uf0b7\nIf the document was saved previously, it would be saved behind the scenes and the new version would\ninclude the new changes\nA document can also be saved when you attempt to close an application:\n\uf0b7\nIf you create a document or modify one, if you close the application (or the window), you will be asked\nwhether you want to save it. If you want to save it, you should click Yes. If the document was not saved\npreviously, a dialog box would come up.\n\uf0b7\nIf you have modified a previously saved document and if you attempt to close the application (or the\nwindow), the computer would ask you whether you want to save the document. If you want to save it, you\nshould click Yes. In this case, the new version of the document would keep the changes you made. If you\nclick No, the document would revert back to what it was before it was opened or the previous time it was\nsaved\nWhen saving a document for the first time, you must give it a name and a location.\nTo make it possible to easily recognize its information in a computer that runs Microsoft Windows, a drive,\nsuch as those we have reviewed above, uses some units. The primary unit is called a directory. In Windows\nExplorer or My Computer, a directory is represented by a letter. When (the disc of) a drive is created, it doesn't\ncontain directories. This is because the manufacturer doesn't decide how and on what type of computer the drive\nwill be used. When a drive is installed on a computer, the operating system decides about the drive, creates it as\na directory and assign a letter to it. You can store a document on a drive but this is not recommended.\nCreating a Folder\nTo better organize the information that it contains, one or more units can be created on a drive. Each unit is\ncalled a folder. When (the disc of) a drive is created, it doesn't contain folders. When the operating system is\ninstalled, it creates a few folders. You also can create a folder and you have many alternatives.\nWhen it comes to folders, a drive is called the root folder or simply, the root. To create a folder in the root, in\nWindows Explorer or My Computer:\n\uf0b7 In the left frame, click the drive. On the main menu, click File \uf0e8 New \uf0e8 Folder and give it a name\n\uf0b7 In the left frame, click the drive. In the right frame, right-click a white empty area \uf0e8 position the mouse on\nNew \uf0e8 click Folder. Then give it a name\nYou can also create a folder inside of another. The folder that will contain the new one is referred to as the\nparent folder. The other will be referred to as a child folder. To create a folder in another folder, in Windows\nExplorer or My Computer:\n\uf0b7\nIn the left frame, expand the drive by clicking its + button. Under the drive, click the folder name. If the new\nfolder will be created inside of another folder that itself has a parent, expand it also and click the parent\nfolder. On the main menu, click File \uf0e8 New \uf0e8 Folder and give it a name\n52\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\n\uf0b7\nIn the left frame, click the drive and click the parent folder. In the right frame, right-click the parent folder,\nposition the mouse on New and click Folder, then give it a name\nYou can also create a folder when saving a file. To do this, in the dialog box that comes up, click the Create\nNew Folder button and give it a name.\nNaming a Folder\nThere are some suggestions you should follow and various rules you must observe when naming a folder:\n\uf0b7\nThe name of a folder can be a single letter or a digit\n\uf0b7\nThe name of a folder can also be a single special character except the following: | > \/ : \\ < ? * and \"\n\uf0b7\nThe name of a folder can be a combination of letters, digits, and some special characters\nAs a suggestion, you should use a name that indicates what is stored in the folder. This makes it easy to find\ninformation.\nArchive\nArchives are files that contain other files. Typically the files in an archive are compressed. Archives usually\nhave file names ending with ZIP, LZH, ARJ, or ARC, depending on how they were created. Archives make it\neasy to group files and make transporting and copying these files faster.\nTypical Uses of Archives\n\uf0b7\nMost files available on the Internet and on electronic services like America Online are distributed as\narchives. Two benefits of using archives for electronic file distribution are that only one file transfer\noperation (\"download\") is required to obtain all related files, and file transfer time is minimized because the\nfiles in an archive are compressed.\n\uf0b7\nIt is often useful to send a group of related files to an associate. Rather than distributing individual files it is\noften easier to distribute the files as an archive to benefit from the file grouping and compression.\n\uf0b7\nSome files are important but not used often. To save disk space simply compress these files into an archive\nwhen they are not used, and decompress them only when needed.\nSelf-Extracting Zip File\nA self-extracting Zip file is an executable program file (.EXE file) that includes both a Zip file and software to\nextract or \"unzip\" the contents of the Zip file. Users can extract the contents of a self-extracting Zip file by\nsimply running it. This is convenient, because the end user does not need an unzip program (like WinZipfi) to\nextract files from these self-extracting archives.\nWinZip Self-Extractor Personal Edition, included with WinZip, creates Windows self-extracting Zip files.\nArchive formats:\n\uf0b7\nZip files are the most common archive format. Zip files can span multiple disks, and provide both\ncompression and file grouping. WinZip does not use external programs to work with Zip files.\n53\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\n\uf0b7\nTAR, Z, GZ, TAZ, and TGZ files are often found on Unix-based Internet sites. TAR stands for \"Tape\nARchive\". The TAR format does not provide compression; it is used only to group files. GZ and Z files are\ngzip files. GZ and Z files cannot contain multiple files. TAZ and TGZ files are TAR files compressed in the\ngzip format. Since almost all new archives are created in Zip format, WinZip does not provide facilities to\nadd to or create files in these formats (however, all other WinZip functions are supported). WinZip does not\nuse external programs when working with files in these formats.\n\uf0b7\nFile formats such as UUencoded, XXencoded, BinHex, and MIME are used primarily to transfer binary files\nby Internet e-mail. If you encounter one of these files, you can open it and extract its contents with WinZip.\nYou can UUencode an archive using the UUencode entry in the WinZip Actions pull-down menu. WinZip\ndoes not use external programs when working with files in these formats.\n\uf0b7\nWinZip also handles most files in the old Microsoft Compress format (also known as LZEXPAND format).\nHowever, there are several variations on this format, and Microsoft has not released documentation on these\nvariations. WinZip issues an appropriate message if you attempt to decompress a file not supported by your\nversion of Windows. Microsoft Compress files usually end with a trailing underscore, for example,\n\"commdlg.dl_\". Like Z and GZ files, Microsoft Compress format files contain only one file. This format is\nused for many files on the Windows 3.1 distribution disks and many older Microsoft products. Note that not\nall files ending with an underscore are Microsoft Compress format files. WinZip does not use external\nprograms when working with files in these formats.\n\uf0b7\nThe Microsoft CAB (short for Cabinet) format is used by most Microsoft setup programs, including those\nused to install Windows. CAB files provide both file compression and file grouping. You can use WinZip to\nopen and extract the contents of CAB files. WinZip will handle most self-extracting CAB files. WinZip\ndoes not use external programs when working with CAB files.\n\uf0b7\nARC, ARJ, and LZH are older formats that provide both grouping and compression, like Zip files. Unlike\nother supported file formats, WinZip's optional support for these formats requires external programs that are\nnot included as part of the WinZip distribution.\nFiles\nIn our introductions, we defined a document as what you create in an application. In a word processor, the\ncharacters you type constitute a document. For a graphics application, the drawings you perform or the picture\nyou manipulate is called a document. In order to keep such a document for later use, you must store it\nsomewhere. A file is an object used to hold a document. Put it another way, in order to have a file, you must\nsave a document. We have mentioned how to save a document. Like a folder, you must name a file when saving\na document. The name of a file follows the same rules we defined for a folder.\nFILE MANAGEMENT\nBits and Bytes\nTo hold information, a medium such as a hard disk uses a system that resembles a combination of small boxes.\nLet's illustrate it as follows:\nThis box can hold only a small piece of information. It can only be either 0 or 1. When the box is empty, it\nholds a value of 0. When it is full, it holds a value of 1:\n54\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\n0\n1\nYou can represent a piece of information with one of two states. This box used to represent a value is called a\nbinary digit; in its abbreviated form, it is called a bit (for binary digit).\n0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100\n0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001\n1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110\n1111\nThis produces the following binary combinations: 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001,\n1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111 = 16 combinations. When using the decimal system, these combinations\ncan be represented as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.\nThis combination is also a system that the computer uses to count bits internally. This technique is valuable and\nallows you to always identify a number as a divider of 4.\nWhen all bits of a group of 4 are 0, the combination has the lowest value, which is 0000. Any of the other\ncombinations has at least one 0 bit, except for the last one. When all bits are 1, this provides the highest value\npossible for a group of 4 bits. The lowest value, also considered the minimum value, can be represented as 0.\nThe highest value, also considered the maximum, can be expressed in decimal value as 24 (2 represents the fact\nthat there are two possible states: 0 and 1; 4 represents the fact that there are four possible combinations), which\nis 16. This produces 16 because 24 = 16.\nA combination of 8 consecutive bits is called a byte. The bits are counted from right to left starting at 0:\nYou can represent a byte using a combination of 0s and 1s. If you have the patience to create combinations of\nbits using the boxes as we did for the group of 4, you would find out that there are 256 possible combinations.\nAnother way to find it out is by using the base 2 technique:\n27 + 26 + 25 + 24 + 23 + 22 + 21 + 20\n= 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1\n= 255\n55\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com Expert Solution Consults\nComputer Training Computer Basics\nTherefore, the maximum decimal value you can store in a byte is 255. Remember that the byte with all bits\nhaving a value of 0 has its value set to 0. Since this byte also holds a valid value, the number of combinations =\n255 + 1 = 256.\nThe only type of information you can store in a byte is a character or symbol, such as a readable letter from the\nalphabet: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N,\nO, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z. Besides these readable characters, a byte can also hold one digit: 0, 1, 2,\n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. A byte can also hold a readable or non-readable symbols such as ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) - _ =\n+ [ { ] } \\ | ; : ' < ? . \/ , > \"\nThis means that a combination of 8 bits, called a byte, is enough to represent one symbol recognized in the\nEnglish language. In this globalization word, a computer also needs to be able to store characters from other\nLatin-based languages such as letters from Fran(cid:231)ais or Espa\u00e6ol. To make this possible, instead of 8 bits, the\noperating system must use 16 bits. A combination of 16 consecutive bits is also called a word.\nA group of 1000 bytes is supposed to be called a kilobyte but, based on the way the computer calculates the\nbits, a group of 1024 bytes is called a kilobyte or KB. A group of 1,000,000 bytes is called a megabyte but\nactually it is a group of 1,024,000 bytes that is called a megabyte or MB. A group of 1,000,000,000 bytes or\nactually a group of 1,073,741,824 bytes is called a gigabyte or GB.\nThe Size of a Drive\nBecause a drive cannot have unlimited space, it is recognized for its size. The size of a drive can be measured\nby, or specified in, MB or GB. For example, a typical CD can hold 700MB of data. A regular DVD can hold\ninformation up to 4.7GB in size. The sizes of hard drives are very varied. To find the size of a hard drive in your\ncomputer, from either Windows Explorer or My Computer, you can right-click the drive letter and click\nProperties.\nThe Size of a File\nIn order to keep track of the various files in a computer, each file has a size. The size of a file can be measured\nin bytes, kilobytes, or megabytes. To know the size of a file, in either Windows Explorer or My Computer, you\ncan right-click it and click Properties.\n56\/59, Nov - 2010 (cid:133)Learn to Know Why and How!\nadebisijeleel@yahoo.com or adebisijeleel@gmail.com\nView publication stats "}
