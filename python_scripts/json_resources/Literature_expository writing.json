There are lots of\ndefinitions of rhetoric, and the definition that makes the\nmostsensetoyouandyourunderstandingofcommunicationwill\nimpacthowyoudeployrhetoricalanalysis.Thefollowingareafew\ndefinitions of rhetoric:\n\u2022 Ancient Greek rhetorAristotle: \u201cRhetoric may be defined as\nthe faculty of observing in any given case the available means\nRhetorical Reading and Composing | 25 of persuasion.\u201d\n\u2022 British rhetoricianI.

Now,\nmush them together, paraphrase, and come up with a\ndefinition that resonates with your understanding of\nrhetoric.\nRhetorical analysis helps us understand the various components\nthat make a communicative act\/artifact successful or not. A key\ncomponent to effective rhetorical analysis is careful, active\n26 | Rhetorical Reading and Composing attentiontowhattheauthorandhertextaretryingtoaccomplish.\nKrista Ratcliffe calls such attentionrhetorical listening.\nMost people summarize rhetorical listening as an orientation of\nactive openness toward communication, and Ratcliffe identifies\nmultiple components for such a stance:\n\u2022 \u201cacknowledging the existence\u201d of the other, their self, and\ndiscourse;\n\u2022 listening for \u201c(un)conscious presences, absences, and\nunknowns\u201d;\n\u2022 and purposefully \u201cintegrating this information into our world\nviews and decision making.\u201d (29)\nRhetorical listening often draws our attention to absences.\nJacquelineJonesRoyster\u2019sworkonliteracypractices,particularlyof\nnineteenth century Black women, demonstrates how listening for\nand being curious about absences often leads us to understudied\nrhetors. Temptaous McCoy has coined the term amplification\nrhetorics (AR), a method of seeking out and amplifying rhetorical\npractices that may not have been effectively heard. She describes\nAR as a way of examining and celebrating the experiences and\ncommunity rhetorics of Black and marginalized communities.\nTry This: Analyzing Keywords (60 minutes)\nWorking with something you have recently written,\nassign keywords (one or two-word phrases) you believe\nwould do well to convey its significance (don\u2019t count,\njust consider what you think is most important about\nthe text). To do so, follow these steps:\nRhetorical Reading and Composing | 27 \u2022 Identify five to seven keywords based on your\nsense of the text.\n\u2022 Then, turn to a keyword generating tool, such as\nTagCrowd (tagcrowd.com) or the NGram Analyzer\n(guidetodatamining.com\/ngramAnalyzer\/). Copy\nand paste your writing into the platform and\ninitiate the analysis with the aid of the keyword\ngenerating tool. Which words or phrases match\n(as in, you thought they were significant and they\nshow up frequently in your text)? Which words or\nphrases appear in one list but not the other? What\ndo you think explains the differences in the lists?\n\u2022 Next, identify two keywords or phrases you\nbelieve are not sufficiently represented in either\nlist. What are these keywords or phrases, and how\nare they significant to the work you are doing?\nDevelop a one-page revision memo that accounts\nfor how you could go about expanding the\npresence of these underrepresented words or\nphrases in your writing.\nAnother way of thinking of rhetorical listening in the context of\ntextsisPeterElbow\u2019spracticeof\u201cTheBelievingGame,\u201dinwhichhe\nencourages audience members to suspend potential disbelief or\ncritiqueofatext.Insteadofstartingwithcritique,heworkstostep\ninto the authors\u2019 shoes and actually believe whatever they are\nsuggesting. Complimentary to this practice is Sonja K. Foss and\nCindy L. Griffin\u2019s formulation of invitational rhetoric. They offer\n28 | Rhetorical Reading and Composing invitational rhetoric as counter\nto understandings of rhetoric\nas primarily about persuasion,\nlike Aristotle\u2019s definition of\nrhetoric. They see persuasion\nas ultimately about power,\nwhereas invitational rhetoric\ninstead works to develop\nequitable relationships.

Bad Idea About Writing:\n\"Rhetoric is Synonymous with\nEmpty Speech\"\nPATRICIA ROBERTS-MILLER\nAbstract\nPatricia Roberts-Miller\u2019s essay refutes the popular notion\nthat \u201cRhetoric is Synonymous With Empty Speech.\u201d Instead,\nshe demonstrates the use (and periodic) abuse of rhetoric,\nan understanding which is central to effective\ncommunication. This text is the first chapter ofBad Ideas\nAbout Writing, and its placement is notable since the\nassociation of rhetoric and empty speech is so pervasive,\nsince it is a prevalent bad idea with broad implications for\nreading and writing.\nThis reading is available below, as aPDF, and as a\npodcast.\nRecently, I was at a meeting of faculty whose research and\nteaching interests concerned issues of environmentalism. A\ncolleague from another department asked me what my area was.\n\u201cEnvironmental rhetoric,\u201d I replied. He looked slightly shocked and\nthencommented,\u201cGoodenvironmentalismdoesn\u2019thavearhetoric.\u201d\nI\u2019m in a department of rhetoric, so I teach rhetoric, read scholarly\n| 33 piecesonrhetoric,andattendconferencesonrhetoric.However,I\noftenforgetthatotherfacultymembers\u2019viewsonrhetoricmightbe\ndifferent than mine.\nA popular view of rhetoric is that it is a straightforward model\nof how communication should work: A person can speak the truth\nsimplybyusingwordsthatrefertotruethingsintheworld.Ifshe\nchooses not to use sentences filled with words that refer to true\nthingsintheworld,thensheisengagedinrhetoric.Rhetoric,inthis\nview,issomethingyouaddontosentences(suchasmetaphor)that\ndecoratesandobscurescommunication.IfIsay,\u201cThecatisonthe\nmat,\u201d I am using language correctly. However, if I say, \u201cThe elegant\nfeline languishes mournfully on the expensive carpet, waiting\nimpatiently for what he sees as his lazy servants to open a can of\nsalmon,\u201dthenIhaveaddedrhetorictothefirstsentence,orchosen\nrhetoric over clear communication.\nFormanypeople,thesimpler,plainerversionofthesentenceis\nnotjustastylisticchoice,it\u2019samoralone.Manypeoplebelievethat\nthe addition of more complicated words obscures the meaning of\nthe sentence. Rhetoric, to them, is something that hides the truth.\nIf you look at the two sentences, though, you can see that the\nelaborated, supposedly more rhetorical one communicates quite\nclearly.Infact,itcommunicatesmoreeffectivelyandpreciselythan\n\u201cThecatisonthemat.\u201dItmight,ofcourse,befalse\u2014theremightnot\nbesuchacat;itmightnotbeelegant;itmightnotbethinkingmuch\nof anything; it might be quite cheerful; it might not like salmon.\nBut the same is true of the simpler sentence\u2014there might not be\na cat; it might not be on a mat. Thus, linguistic simplicity and\ntruthfulnessaren\u2019tnecessarilyconnected,andlinguisticcomplexity\nand truthfulness aren\u2019t necessarily opposed.\nOr, to put it another way, for a long time, philosophers of\nlanguage insisted that language works by sentences having\npropositional content\u2014\u201cthe cat is on the mat\u201d\u2014which can be\nexpressed in various ways. Rhetoric is what we layer onto the\nproposition. Or, as the old saying goes, \u201cRhetoric is clothing on\n34 | the idea.\u201d In an Edenic world, we would all wander around naked,\nandwewouldallsimplyandclearlyspeakourthoughts;rhetoricis\nsomething we must have in this fallen world.\nPeople who believe that rhetoric hides meaning believe that\nwe could return to Eden by using simple, plain, and rhetoric-free\nlanguage.Oneofseveralunderlyingassumptionsisthatit\u2019sharder\nto lie in plain language, or that lies are more obvious when the\nlanguageislesscomplicated.Therefore,wecantrustplainlanguage\nand should treat complicated language with suspicion. Oddly\nenough, this seemingly straightforward proposition isn\u2019t true. In\notherwords,thissimplebeliefshowsthatanideacanbeuntrueand\npersuasive at the same time. It is also interesting that the master\ndeceivershavegenerallyreliedonsimple,yetfalse,claims.It\u2019squite\nlikelythatpeoplebelievedtheirassertionswereclearandplainand,\ntherefore, assumed that they must be true.\nTheEdenicviewisn\u2019tahelpfulwaytothinkaboutrhetoric.It\nisn\u2019t even how language works.

It comes from\nthe Greek word for a person with a certain role in the Athenian\nAssembly(rhetor).ItisbelievedthatitwasPlatowhoaddedthe-ic\nlater.\nHe used rhetoric in terms of speech-making as opposed to\narguinginsmallgroups.Platowasn\u2019topposedtoargumentation,and\nhe wasn\u2019t even opposed to some verbal sleight of hand. After all,\nSocrates\u2014oftenreadasakindofspokesmanforPlato\u2019sviews\u2014relied\nheavilyonsomefairlydodgylogicalmovesinthedialogues.Plato\u2019s\npoint seems to be that speech-making isn\u2019t a very useful skill\n| 35 because making speeches to large groups (Athenian juries might\nhave hundreds of people) is not very effective for getting to the\ntruth.Itmightbeeffectiveforgettingotherstoacceptthetruthone\nhasalreadyfiguredout(thatseemstobethepointthatSocratesis\nmakinginthedialoguePhaedrus),but,ifyouwanttofindoutwhat\u2019s\ntrue, argue with another individual. Do not make a speech.\nOf course, Socrates makes a lot of speeches in Platonic\ndialogues. So, it is still murky whether or not Plato noticed the\ncontradiction, was making a different point despite noticing the\nproposition,ordidn\u2019twritethedialoguestogettothetruth.Infact,\nPlato\u2019s overall attitude toward rhetoric is murky, even though his\nschool,theAcademy,didhaverhetoricclasses.Theyweretaughtby\na man named Aristotle.\nOn the other hand, Aristotle, who was a teacher of rhetoric,\nneither defined rhetoric as style nor as something you add to\nlanguage. He described it as a discipline and a skill that enables\nyoutoseetheavailablemeansofpersuasion.ForAristotle,rhetoric\nis about public speaking to large groups, and it is different from\nphilosophy.So,hedidsharethosetwoassumptionswithPlato.But\nhedidn\u2019tagreewithPlatoaboutrhetoricnotgettingustothetruth.\nHethoughtthatitcouldgetustothetruth,butthatitcouldalsobe\nused to deceive. It depends on the motives of the person using it.\nAristotle loved syllogisms, and seems to have believed that\nallreasoningcouldbedonethroughthem.Inphilosophy,togetto\nthe truth, you try to begin with a universally valid major premise\n(e.g.,allmenaremortal).Thenyouhaveamorespecificproposition\nrelated to that premise (e.g., Socrates is a man) that enables you\nto draw a conclusion (e.g., Socrates is mortal). But Aristotle said\nthat this kind of reasoning doesn\u2019t work in large assemblies for\ntwo reasons. First, during a speech, people don\u2019t have the time\nto reason from universally valid major premises\u2014if you\u2019re arguing\naboutwhetherPhilipofMacedonrepresentsathreat,it\u2019suselessto\ntrytofinduniversallyvalidpremisesabouttyrantsorwarorpeople\nfrom Macedon. You don\u2019t have time.

If I am making a speech trying to\npersuade people to become more active in politics, I might argue\nfrom precedent (listed as #11 of his 28 lines), or argue that the\nconsequences of political activism are good (#13), or point out\ninconsistenciesintheargumentforpoliticalquietism(#22),andso\non.Thosedifferentlinesaren\u2019tornamentsIhangontheproposition\nthatpeopleshouldbepoliticallyactive;theyarealldifferentwaysof\nthinking about the situation.\nTake, for instance, Aristotle\u2019s first line of argument:\nconsideration of the opposite, a strategy that might structure my\nentire case.

Bad Idea About Writing:\n\"First-Year Composition\nPrepares Students for\nAcademic Writing\"\nTYLER BRANSON\nAbstract\nTyler S. Branson\u2019s essay \u201cFirst-Year Composition\nPrepares Students for Academic Writing\u201d comes from the\nbookBad Ideas About Writing. In Branson\u2019s essay, he draws\non research about the purpose of first-year writing to posit\nthat first-year writing courses have the potential to foster\nstudents\u2019 understanding of how language is shaped by, and\nused in, social, political, and cultural contexts. To\naccomplish this goal, Branson argues that we need to shift\nthe emphasis of first-year writing away from notions of\ncorrectness and grammar and toward empowering\nstudents to learn how to position themselves in public\ndiscourse.\nThis reading is available below, as aPDF, and as a\npodcast.\nIhaveamemorythatreallysticksoutinmymindwhenIthinkof\nBad Idea About Writing: | 41 allthebadideasaboutwriting.Iwasatthedentistmakingsmalltalk,\nand my dentist asked, \u201cSo what is it you teach at the university?\u201d\nSquintingatthebrightlightaboveme,Iresponded,\u201cIteachmostly\nfirst-yearwriting.\u201d\u201cUhoh!\u201dhechuckled,lookingbackatthedental\nassistantsbehindhim.\u201cBetterwatchmygrammararoundyou,huh?\u201d\nHe paused and said, thoughtfully, \u201cYou know, I should send my\nson to you. He can\u2019t spell to save his life!\u201d To be fair, these sorts\nof comments are made innocently enough and, anecdotally, they\ntend to happen a lot. The reason for this, I think, is because of\na particularly bad idea about writing and writing instruction, one\nthat surprisingly hasn\u2019t let up in the past 40 years: that first-year\nwriting is a basic course in language, grammar, and syntax that\nprepares students for something called academic writing in the\nmore \u201clegitimate\u201d courses in the university; and that its teachers\nconsistprimarilyoferror-correctorsandbehavior-modifiersarmed\nwithredpensandelbowpatches.However,suchanantiquatedview\nofwhatfirst-yearwritingisandcanbeonlyscratchesthesurfaceof\nthe kinds of learning possible in a writing classroom.\nMy dentist understands first-year writing as remedial\ninstructioninlanguage,butthisisanoutdateddescriptionforthis\nuniversal course in U.S. higher education.

When writing instructors attempt to do otherwise,\nthey are often met with opposition and charges of attempting to\nindoctrinate their students and politicize the classroom.\nConservative website Minding the Campus describes this as little\nwriting, but plenty of activism. When it appears that American\nstudents aren\u2019t writing well, it\u2019s easy to point to first-year writing\nand ask, well what are they teaching in there? In fact, first-year\nwriting teachers are often scapegoats for political debates that\nextend beyond the writing classroom.

On the contrary, courses in rhetoric and\ncomposition can be very helpful in allowing students to practice\nacademic-level reading and writing in other disciplines, and this\noften helps students better understand the various kinds of writ-\ning they are bound to encounter in the university.

First-year writing isn\u2019t just about\npreparing students for academic writing.

Part of this\nmeans getting students to develop better methods of writing and\nreading in digital environments, which involves discerning what\nphilosopher Harry Frankfurt has called bullshit. A recent survey\nfoundthat84%ofAmericanstudentsindicatedtheywouldbenefit\nfrom learning whether or not certain online sources are\ntrustworthy.

Researchers who study this phenomenon, such as Linda S.\nBergmann and Janet Zepernick, call this concept transfer, for\nobvious reasons.\nThis awareness of the essential social-ness of language is\nheightened through the training FYC students receive in the\npersuasive and purposeful uses of language. FYC is typically a\nstudent\u2019s first encounter with the ancient human practice known\nas rhetoric, the original being-together-through-language art of\nhow to be persua- sive using words, symbols, and gestures.

Still, if you\ncan recall a time when you heard poetry read aloud (either by\nyourself or a classmate) it likely made a lot more sense than when\nyou read it on the page. As you read aloud to paraphrase, you\nneed not paraphrase every single word, but you should stop every\nfew sentences or so and annotate the text by writing, in your own\nwords, what you just read.\n68 | Developing a Repertoire of Reading Strategies 1.

It is a bad idea to continue privileging writing at the\nexpense of reading.\nThis problematic separation of the connected practices of\nreading and writing is no longer an issue in students\u2019 early\nschooling, where they are taught reading and writing\nsimultaneously. Although it took decades for elementary school\nteachers and curricula developers to realize that young children\nneed not learn how to read before they learned how to write,\nlanguage arts instructors now teach reading and writing alongside\neach other. They do so because research has shown that students\nlearn to read and write better when they are instructed in both\nsimultaneously. This research, for example, shows that students\u2019\nphonic skills are rein- forced when children practice both reading\nandwritingthesamewords.Astheygetalittleolder,studentsbegin\nto develop an awareness of genres or types of text, which, like the\nstudy of phonics, is also further reinforced by a concurrent focus\nonreadingandwriting.Asstudentsread(orarereadto)theylearn\ntorecognizetypicalelementsoffiction,whichtheythenimitatein\ntheir own writing and stories.

Instead of drawing on models of\nearlyliteracyeducationthatfocusonteachingreadingandwriting\nsimultaneously, college and universities largely privilege writing\nover reading. This hierarchy is evidenced by the universal first-\nBad Idea About Writing: \"Reading and Writing Are Not Connected\" | 79 year writing requirement in American colleges and universities, as\nwell as by writing across the curriculum programs. The integrated\napproach to teaching reading and writing falls away to students\u2019\nperil and causes great frustration in the professors who often\nattributestudents\u2019strugglesintheircoursestopoorwritingability,\nwhen these problems are often related to students\u2019 reading\ndifficulties.

When one reads, the same\nthing is happening.

That personal transaction with the text has affected how\neachreadercreatesmeaning.Whenreadingandwritingaretaught\nalongside each other in the college-level classroom, students can\ngain practice experiencing and relishing in opportunities to create\nmeaning not just through writing, but through reading everything\nfrom print texts to art to websites to national news events, all\nof which they will continue to engage beyond school. Focusing\non active reading approaches, including everything from\ncomprehension strategies to ways of determining something\u2019s\ninherent values and biases to productive methods of responding,\nis crucial if students are going to leave postsecondary institutions\nprepared to be informed, aware, and engaged citizens.\nUnfortunately, there is still a great deal of work to be done\nsince recent studies such as The Citation Project, a multi-\ninstitutional, and empirical research project show that students\u2019\nreading abilities are largely underdeveloped. This research seeks\nto understand how students read sources and use them in their\nwriting. With less than 10% of students using summary in their\nwriting (as opposed to paraphrasing, copying, and citing), scholar\nRebeccaMooreHowardandhercolleaguesnotedthattheirfindings\nraise questions about students\u2019 abilities to understand what they\nare reading.

The value of literacy undoubtedly extends far\nBad Idea About Writing: \"Reading and Writing Are Not Connected\" | 81 beyond school. To read and to write is to create, to interpret. If\neducationis,infact,ameanstopreparingcitizenstofunctionand\nparticipate within a democracy then reading and writing\u2014and the\ninterpretive skills they inculcate\u2014are crucial. As research has\nshown, teaching them alongside each other reinforces both skills.\nEven if we want to be a bit cynical and argue that\npostsecondary education has become nothing more than a\nnecessary, but burdensome, step to gaining employment, both\nreading and writing are still just as important. A 2011 survey found\nthat 86% of corporate recruiters said strong communication skills\nwere a priority\u2014well ahead of the next skill.

Teaching reading and writing together will\nhelp students become more proficient in both.\nDeveloping those communication skills means that those of\nus within education should look at the curricula we teach and\/\nor administer and ask ourselves if we have fallen into the trap of\ncompartmentalizing reading and writing to the detriment of our\nstudents.

How to Read Like a\nWriter\nMIKE BUNN\nAbstract\nMichael Bunn\u2019s essay \u201cHow to Read Like a Writer\u201d comes\nfrom the bookWriting Spaces. The book offers the\nfollowing abstract for the text: \u201cLearning to \u2018read like a\nwriter\u2019 can be a great benefit to students. [\u2026] Students will\nfind this chapter useful for expanding their writing\nstrategies by helping them learn to identify key moments in\ntexts, moments when the author uses an innovative\ntechnique, which they might employ in their own writing.\u201d\nThis reading is available below and as aPDF.\nIn 1997, I was a recent college graduate living in London for six\nmonthsandworkingatthePalaceTheatreownedbyAndrewLloyd\nWebber. The Palace was a beautiful red brick, four-story theatre\nin the heart of London\u2019s famous West End, and eight times a week\nit housed a three-hour performance of the musical Les Miserables.\nBecauseofantiquatedfire-safetylaws,everytheatreinthecitywas\nrequiredtohaveacertainnumberofstaffmembersinsidewatching\nthe performance in case of an emergency.\nMy job (in addition to wearing a red tuxedo jacket) was to sit\ninside the dark theater with the patrons and make sure nothing\n86 | How to Read Like a Writer went wrong. It didn\u2019t seem to matter to my supervisor that I had\nno training in security and no idea where we kept the fire\nextinguishers. I was pretty sure that if there was any trouble I\u2019d\nbe running down the back stairs, leaving the patrons to fend for\nthemselves. I had no intention of dying in a bright red tuxedo.\nThere was a Red Coat stationed on each of the theater\u2019s four\nfloors, and we all passed the time by sitting quietly in the back,\nreading books with tiny flashlights. It\u2019s not easy trying to read in\nthe dim light of a theatre\u2014flashlight or no flashlight\u2014and it\u2019s even\ntougher with shrieks and shouts and gunshots coming from the\nstage. I had to focus intently on each and every word, often\nrereading a single sentence several times. Sometimes I got\ndistracted and had to re-read entire paragraphs. As I struggled to\nread in this environment, I began to realize that the way I was\nreading\u2014one word at a time\u2014was exactly the same way that the\nauthor had written the text. I realized writing is a word-by-word,\nsentence-by-sentence process. The intense concentra- tion\nrequired to read in the theater helped me recognize some of the\ninteresting ways that authors string words into phrases into\nparagraphs into entire books.\nI came to realize that all writing consists of a series of choices.\nI was an English major in college, but I don\u2019t think I ever\nthought much about reading. I read all the time. I read for my\nclasses and on the computer and sometimes for fun, but I never\nreally thought about the important connections between reading\nandwriting,andhowreadinginaparticularwaycouldalsomakeme\na better writer.\nWhat Does It Mean to Read Like a Writer?\nWhen you Read Like a Writer (RLW) you work to identify some of\nthechoicestheauthormadesothatyoucanbetterunderstandhow\nsuchchoicesmightariseinyourownwriting.Theideaistocarefully\nHow to Read Like a Writer | 87 examine the things you read, looking at the writerly techniques in\nthetextinordertodecideifyoumightwanttoadoptsimilar(orthe\nsame) techniques in your writing.\nYou are reading to learn about writing.\nInstead of reading for content or to better understand the\nideasinthewriting(whichyouwillautomaticallydotosomedegree\nanyway),youaretryingtounderstandhowthepieceofwritingwas\nputtogetherbytheauthorandwhatyoucanlearnaboutwritingby\nreading a particular text.

Then you can go one step\nfurther and imagine what different choices the author might have\nmade instead, and what effect those different choices would have\non readers.\nSay you\u2019re reading an essay in class that begins with a short\nquote from President Barack Obama about the war in Iraq. As a\nwriter, what do you think of this technique? Do you think it is\neffective to begin the essay with a quote? What if the essay began\nwith a quote from someone else? What if it was a much longer\nquote from President Obama, or a quote from the President about\nsomething other than the war?\nAnd here is where we get to the most important part: Would\nyou want to try this technique in your own writing?\nWouldyouwanttostartyourownessaywithaquote?Doyou\nthink it would be effective to begin your essay with a quote from\nPresident Obama?

Author and professor Wendy Bishop explains\nhow her reading process changed when she began to read like a\nwriter:\nIt wasn\u2019t until I claimed the sentence as my area of desire,\ninterest,andexpertise\u2014untilIwantedtobeawriterwriting\nbetter\u2014that I had to look underneath my initial readings .\n. . I started asking, how\u2014how did the writer get me to feel,\nhow did the writer say something so that it remains in my\nmemory when many other things too easily fall out, how\ndidthewritercommunicatehis\/herintentionsaboutgenre,\nabout irony? (119\u201320)\nBishop moved from simply reporting her personal reactions to the\nthings she read to attempting to uncover how the author led her\n(and other readers) to have those reactions. This effort to uncover\nhow authors build texts is what makes Reading Like a Writer so\nuseful for student writers.\nHow Is RLW Different from \u201cNormal\u201d Reading?\nMostofthetimewereadforinformation.Wereadarecipetolearn\nhow to bake lasagna. We read the sports page to see if our school\nwonthegame,Facebooktoseewhohascommentedonourstatus\nHow to Read Like a Writer | 89 update, a history book to learn about the Vietnam War, and the\nsyllabus to see when the next writing assignment is due. Reading\nLike a Writer asks for something very different.\nIn 1940, a famous poet and critic named Allen Tate discussed\ntwo different ways of reading:\nThere are many ways to read, but generally speaking there\naretwoways.Theycorrespondtothetwowaysinwhichwe\nmaybeinterestedinapieceofarchitecture.Ifthebuilding\nhas Corinthian columns, we can trace the origin and\ndevelopment of Corinthian columns; we are interested as\nhistorians. But if we are interested as architects, we may\nor may not know about the history of the Corinthian style;\nwe must, however, know all about the construction of the\nbuilding, down to the last nail or peg in the beams. We\nhave got to know this if we are going to put up buildings\nourselves. (506)\nWhile I don\u2019t know anything about Corinthian columns (and\ndoubt that I will ever want to know anything about Corinthian\ncolumns), Allen Tate\u2019s metaphor of reading as if you were an\narchitect is a great way to think about RLW. When you read like a\nwriter, you are trying to figure out how the text you are reading\nwas constructed so that you learn how to \u201cbuild\u201d one for yourself.\nAuthor David Jauss makes a similar comparison when he writes\nthat \u201creading won\u2019t help you much unless you learn to read like a\nwriter.Youmustlookatabookthewayacarpenterlooksatahouse\nsomeoneelsebuilt,examiningthedetailsinordertoseehowitwas\nmade\u201d (64).\nPerhaps I should change the name and call this Reading Like\nan Architect, or Reading Like a Carpenter. In a way those names\nmake perfect sense. You are reading to see how something was\nconstructed so that you can construct something similar yourself.\n90 | How to Read Like a Writer Why Learn to Read Like a Writer?\nFormostcollegestudentsRLWisanewwaytoread,anditcan\nbedifficulttolearnatfirst.Makingthingsevenmoredifficultisthat\nyourcollegewritinginstructormayexpectyoutoreadthiswayfor\nclassbutneveractuallyteachyouhowtodoit.Heorshemaynot\neventellyouthatyou\u2019resupposedtoreadthisway.Thisisbecause\nmost writing instructors are so focused on teaching writing that\nthey forget to show students how they want them to read.\nThat\u2019s what this essay is for.\nInadditiontothefactthatyourcollegewritinginstructormay\nexpect you to read like a writer, this kind of reading is also one of\ntheverybestwaystolearnhowtowritewell.Readinglikeawriter\ncan help you understand how the process of writing is a series of\nmakingchoices,andindoingso,canhelpyourecognizeimportant\ndecisions you might face and techniques you might want to use\nwhen working on your own writing.

Throughout the rest of the\nessayI\u2019dliketosharesomeoftheirinsightsandsuggestions;after\nall,whoisbetterqualifiedtohelpyoulearnwhatyouneedtoknow\naboutreadingincollegewritingcoursesthanstudentswhorecently\ntook those courses themselves?\nOneofthethingsthatseveralstudentsmentionedtodofirst,\nbefore you even start reading, is to consider the context\nsurrounding both the assignment and the text you\u2019re reading. As\none former student, Alison, states: \u201cThe reading I did in college\nasked me to go above and beyond, not only in breadth of subject\nmatter, but in depth, with regards to informed analysis and\nbackgroundinformationoncontext.\u201dAlisonwasaskedtothinkabout\nsome of the factors that went into the creation of the text, as\nwell as some of the factors influencing her own experience of\nreading\u2014taken together these constitute the context of reading.\nAnotherformerstudent,Jamie,suggeststhatstudents\u201clearnabout\nthe historical context of the writings\u201d they will read for class.\nWritingprofessorRichardStraubputsitthisway:\u201cYou\u2019renotgoing\nto just read a text. You\u2019re going to read a text within a certain\ncontext, a set of circumstances . . . It\u2019s one kind of writing or\nanother, designed for one audience and purpose or another\u201d (138).\nAmong the contextual factors you\u2019ll want to consider before\nyou even start reading are:\n92 | How to Read Like a Writer \u2022 Do you know the author\u2019s purpose for this piece of writing?\n\u2022 Do you know who the intended audience is for this piece of\nwriting?\nItmaybethatyouneedtostartreadingbeforeyoucananswer\nthese first two questions, but it\u2019s worth trying to answer them\nbefore you start. For example, if you know at the outset that the\nauthor is trying to reach a very specific group of readers, then\nhis or her writerly techniques may seem more or less effective\nthan if he\/she was trying to reach a more general audience.\nSimilarly\u2014returning to our earlier example of beginning an essay\nwith a quote from President Obama about the war in Iraq\u2014if you\nknow that the author\u2019s purpose is to address some of the dangers\nand drawbacks of warfare, this may be a very effective opening. If\nthepurposeistoencourageAmericanstowearsunscreenwhileat\nthebeachthisopeningmakesnosenseatall.Oneformerstudent,\nLola, explained that most of her reading assignments in college\nwriting classes were designed \u201cto provoke analysis and criticisms\ninto the style, structure, andpurposeof the writing itself.\u201d\nIn What Genre Is This Written?\nAnother important thing to consider before reading is the genre\nof the text. Genre means a few different things in college English\nclasses, but it\u2019s most often used to indicate the type of writing:\na poem, a newspa- per article, an essay, a short story, a novel, a\nlegalbrief,aninstructionmanual,etc.Becausetheconventionsfor\neach genre can be very differ- ent (who ever heard of a 900-page\nnewspaperarticle?),techniquesthatareeffectiveforonegenremay\nnot work well in another. Many readers expect poems and pop\nsongs to rhyme, for example, but might react negatively to a legal\nbrief or instruction manual that did so.\nHow to Read Like a Writer | 93 Another former student, Mike, comments on how important\nthe genre of the text can be for reading:\nI think a lot of the way I read, of course, depends on the\ntype of text I\u2019m reading. If I\u2019m reading philosophy, I always\nlook for signaling words (however, therefore, furthermore,\ndespite)indicatingthedirectionoftheargument...whenI\nreadfictionorcreativenonfiction,Ilookforhowtheauthor\ninserts dialogue or character sketches within narration or\nenvironmentalobservation.AfterreadingTotheLighthouse\n[sic]lastsemester,Ihavenoticedhowmuchmoreattentive\nI\u2019ve become to the types of narration (omniscient,\nimpersonal, psychological, realistic, etc.), and how these\ndifferent approaches are utilized to achieve an author\u2019s\noverall effect.\nAlthough Mike specifically mentions what he looked for while\nreading a published novel, one of the great things about RLW is\nthat it can be used equally well with either published or student-\nproduced writing.\nIs This a Published or a Student-Produced Piece\nof Writing?\nAs you read both kinds of texts you can locate the choices the\nauthormadeandimaginethedifferentdecisionsthathe\/shemight\nhave made. While it might seem a little weird at first to imagine\nhow published texts could be written differently\u2014after all, they\nwere good enough to be published\u2014remember that all writing can\nbeimproved.ScholarNancyWalkerbelievesthatit\u2019simportantfor\nstudents to read published work using RLW because \u201cthe work\nceases to be a mere artifact, a stone tablet, and becomes instead\na living utterance with immediacy and texture. It could have been\nbetter or worse than it is had the author made different choices\u201d\n94 | How to Read Like a Writer (36). As Walker suggests, it\u2019s worth thinking about how the\npublishedtextwouldbedifferent\u2014maybeevenbetter\u2014iftheauthor\nhadmadedifferentchoicesinthewritingbecauseyoumaybefaced\nwith similar choices in your own work.\nIs This the Kind of Writing You Will Be Assigned\nto Write Yourself?\nKnowing ahead of time what kind of writing assignments you will\nbe asked to complete can really help you to read like a writer.\nIt\u2019s prob- ably impossible (and definitely too time consuming) to\nidentify all of the choices the author made and all techniques an\nauthor used, so it\u2019s important to prioritize while reading. Knowing\nwhat you\u2019ll be writing yourself can help you prioritize. It may be\nthecasethatyourinstructorhasassignedthetextyou\u2019rereadingto\nserve as model for the kind of writing you\u2019ll be doing later. Jessie,\na former student, writes, \u201cIn college writing classes, we knew we\nwere reading for a purpose\u2014to influence or inspire our own work.\nThereadingthatIhavedoneincollegewritingcourseshasalways\nbeenreallyspecifictoacertaintypeofwriting,anditallowsmeto\nfocus and experiment on that specific style in depth and without\ndistraction.\u201d\nIf the text you\u2019re reading is a model of a particular style of\nwriting\u2014for example, highly-emotional or humorous\u2014RLW is\nparticularly helpful because you can look at a piece you\u2019re reading\nand think about whether you want to adopt a similar style in your\nown writing. You might realize that the author is trying to arouse\nsympathy in readers and examine what techniques he\/she uses to\ndothis;thenyoucandecidewhetherthesetechniquesmightwork\nwell in your own writing. You might notice that the author keeps\nincludingjokesorfunnystoriesandthinkaboutwhetheryouwant\ntoincludetheminyourwriting\u2014whatwouldtheimpactbeonyour\npotential readers?\nHow to Read Like a Writer | 95 What Are Questions to Ask As You Are Reading?\nIt is helpful to continue to ask yourself questions as you read\nlike a writer. As you\u2019re first learning to read in this new way, you\nmaywanttohaveasetofquestionswrittenortypedoutinfrontof\nyouthatyoucanrefertowhilereading.Eventually\u2014afterplentyof\npractice\u2014you will start to ask certain questions and locate certain\nthings in the text almost automatically. Remember, for most\nstudents this is a new way of reading, and you\u2019ll have to train\nyourself to do it well. Also keep in mind that you\u2019re reading to\nunderstand how the text was written\u2014 how the house was\nbuilt\u2014more than you\u2019re trying to determine the meaning of the\nthings you read or assess whether the texts are good or bad.\nFirst, return to two of the same questions I suggested that you\nconsiderbeforereading:\n\u2022 What is the author\u2019s purpose for this piece of writing?\n\u2022 Who is the intended audience?\nThink about these two questions again as you read. It may be\nthatyoucouldn\u2019treallyanswerthembefore,orthatyourideaswill\nchangewhilereading.Knowingwhythepiecewaswrittenandwho\nit\u2019s for can help explain why the author might have made certain\nchoices or used particular techniques in the writing, and you can\nassessthosechoicesandtechniquesbasedinpartonhoweffective\nthey are in fulfilling that purpose and\/or reaching the intended\naudience.\nBeyondtheseinitialtwoquestions,thereisanalmostendless\nlist of questions you might ask regarding writing choices and\ntechniques.

For many, reflecting on past\nliteracy experiences can be frustrating, traumatic, or confusing.\nWherever you find yourself on this spectrum, we invite you to\nconsider the purpose of reflecting on literacy: to be able to be\nmetacognitive about writing, or aware of the ways that you think\nabout writing, such that you can become a more strategic, skillful\ncommunicator. One way to get started is to consider how others\nhave described their literacy.\nFirst, consider an award-winning literacy narrative by MTSU\nstudent Jennifer Hale, published in our GEWA Archive, \u201cMy\nExperience With Literacy, Part Two.\u201d\nYou might also peruse the Digital Archive of Literacy Narratives.\nThis is an amazing resource that provides access to thousands of\nstories in various forms \u2013 video, text, and audio \u2013 about people\u2019s\nliteracy experiences.\nWe hope that reading these essays will be inspiring to you. You\ncan also submit your work for the Gen Ed Writing Awards and\nmaybe have your work published in next year\u2019s GEM!\nLiteracy and Composing Processes | 107 Consider the five readings in this section that help us think\nthrough experiences and skills that help us reflect on our own\nalphabetic literacy.

Many first-year\nwriters have been taught that using first-person pronouns\nis prohibited because it may detract from their ability to\nremain objective in their academic writing. This chapter\ncomplicates preconceptions surrounding the \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d and\n\u201cme\u201d of writing in the academy. McKinney Maddalena\u2019s\npiece presents information on how student voices can\nweave themselves into writing for their classes with\npurpose and impact.\nThis reading is available below and as aPDF.\nAt this point in your development as a writer, you may have\nlearned to write \u201cI-less\u201d prose, without first person. I-less-ness is\nI Need You to Say I | 111 fine; writing habits, like all habits, are best simplified when first\nlearned or re-learned. Jazz pianists learn strict scales before they\nare allowed to improvise.

Constructing arguments without\nusing\u201cI\u201disgoodpracticeforformal\u201cimprovisation\u201dathigherlevels\nof thinking and writing. Avoiding personal pronouns forces you to\nbe objective. It also \u201csounds\u201d more formal; you\u2019re more likely to\nmaintain an appropriate tone if you stay away from the personal.\nBut writing in various academic and professional contexts\nneeds to be more flexible, sophisticated, and subtle than writing\nfor high school English classes. In college, you should start using\nfirst-person pronouns in your formal academic writing, where\nappropriate. First person has an important place\u2014an irreplaceable\nplace\u2014in texts that report research and engage scholarship. Your\nchoices about where you place yourself as subject are largely\ndetermined by context and the conventions of the field in which\nyou\u2019re writing. The key is making sure that your choices are\nappropriateforthecontextofyourpaper\u2014whomyou\u2019rewritingit\nfor,andthekindofinformationit\u2019smeanttocommunicate.HereI\u2019ll\nlistsomewaysinwhichfirstpersonimproveswrittenargumentand\nshowyousomeexamplesofthewaysscholarsusefirstperson,and\nthenI\u2019llproposeplaceswhereitmightbeusedappropriatelyinyour\nown writing.\nWhy \u201cI\u201d?\nFirst person can support the following characteristics of good\nwritten argument (and good writing in general).\n1. Objectivity and Integrity\nThe main reason most teachers give for the discipline of I-less-\nness is that it keeps your writing \u201cobjective.\u201d They want to make\nsure that you don\u2019t rely on personal experiences or perspectives\n112 | I Need You to Say I where you should be providing concrete, researched support for\nyour arguments. Your best friend at summer camp doesn\u2019t \u201cprove\u201d\nasociologicaltheory.Yourmemoryofa\u201cfact\u201d\u2014theaveragerainfall\nin a town, the actions of a character in a film, the tendencies of\ngroups of people to behave in certain ways, or the population of\nKenya\u2014isnotareliablesourceinacademiccontexts.Youshouldn\u2019t\nwrite, \u201cbecause I think so,\u201d or \u201cI know that . . .\u201d But if you consider\nsome of the higher-level implications of perspective\u2019s effects on\nargument, there are some well-chosen places where \u201cI\u201d can give\nyour argument more objectivity and intellectual integrity.\nTake scientific writing, for example. Up until very recently,\nwhenwritingobservationalandexperimentalreports,scientists,as\na rule, avoided first person. Methodology was (and is still, in many\ncases) described in the passive voice. That is, instead of writing,\n\u201cWe took measurements of ice thickness on the first and 15th day\nof every month,\u201d scientists wrote, \u201cMeasurements of ice thickness\nwere taken on the first and 15th day of every month.\u201d Taking out\nthe\u201cwe\u201dfocusesthereader\u2019sattentiononthephenomenon(object)\nbeingobserved,nottheobservertakingthereadings(subject).Orat\nleastthatwasthereasoningbehindpassivevoiceinsciencewriting.\nBut during the last half of the last century, mostly because of\ndevelopments in physics, scientists have talked a lot about a thing\ncalledthe\u201cobservereffect\u201d:whileobservingorexperimentingwith\na social or even physical system, the scientist watching can affect\nthe system\u2019s behavior. When particle physicists try to measure the\nmotion of something as tiny as an electron, their very observation\nalmost certainly changes that motion. Because of the observer\neffect, the passive voice convention I\u2019ve described above has been\ncalledintoquestion.Isitreallyhonesttoactlike\u201cmeasurementsare\ntaken\u201dbysomeinvisiblehand?Isthepictureminustheresearcher\nthe whole picture? Not really. The fact is, someone took the\nmeasurements, and those measurements might reflect that\nobserver\u2019s involvement. It\u2019s more truthful, complete, and objective,\nthen, to put the researchers in the picture. These days, it\u2019s much\nI Need You to Say I | 113 morecommonto\u201csee\u201dtheresearchersassubjects\u2014\u201cWemeasured\nice thickness . . .\u201d\u2014in methodology sections.\nThat same kind of \u201cwhole picture\u201d honesty applies to you\nmaking written claims, too. When you first learned to write an\nessay, you were probably taught to make claims as though they\nweretrue;write\u201cTheskyisblue,\u201dnot\u201cIthinkthattheskyisblue.\u201d\nThat second claim isn\u2019t arguable\u2014who can disprove that you think\nsomething? But a much more sophisticated claim includes your\nperspectiveandimpliestheeffectitmayhaveonyourstance:\u201cFrom\nmypositionstandingontheearth\u2019ssurfaceinthedaytime,Iseethe\nsky as blue.\u201d You can make that claim without using first person,\nofcourse,andinsomecontexts(i.e.forascientificargument),you\nprobably should. When you\u2019re taking a stance on an issue, though,\nfirstpersonjustmakessense.Definingyourperspectivegivesyour\nreader context for your stance: \u201cAs a volunteer at a bilingual\npreschool, I can see that both language immersion and\nindividualizedlanguageinstructionhavebenefits,\u201dor\u201cAsaprincipal\nat an elementary school with a limited budget, I would argue that\nlanguage immersion makes the most sense.\u201d Consider those two\npositions; without the \u201cwhole picture\u201d that the statement of\nperspectiveimplies,youmightassumethatthetwoclaimsdisagree.\nThe subtlety of the subject\u2014who the writer is\u2014lets you see quite\na bit about why the claim is being made. If you asked the second\nwritertotakeastanceontheimmersion\/bilingualinstructionissue\nwith only learning objectives in mind, she might agree with the\nfirstwriter.The\u201ctruth\u201dmightnotbedifferent,butthepositionit\u2019s\nobserved from can certainly cast a different light on it.\n2. Clarifying Who\u2019s Saying What\nA clear description of your perspective becomes even more\nimportant when your stance has to incorporate or respond to\nsomeone else\u2019s. As you move into more advanced college writing,\nthe claims you respond to will usually belong to scholars. Some\npapersmayrequireyoutospendalmostasmuchtimesummarizing\nascholarlyconversationastheydopresentingpointsofyourown.\nBy \u201csignification,\u201d I mean little phrases that tell the reader, \u201cThis is\n114 | I Need You to Say I myopinion,\u201d\u201cThisismyinterpretation.\u201dYouneedthemfortwobig\nreasons.\nFirstofall,themore\u201cvoices\u201dyouaddtotheconversation,the\nmoreconfusingitgets.Youmustseparateyourowninterpretations\nof scholars\u2019 claims, the claims themselves, and your argument so\nas not to misrepresent any of them.

Science writing can help me illustrate this\nidea, as well. In the imaginary observation report I refer to above,\nthe researchers may or may not use first person in their\nmethodology section out of respect for the observer effect, but\ntheyareverylikelytousefirstpersoninthediscussion\/conclusion\nsection. The discussion section involves interpretation of the\ndata\u2014that is, the researchers must say what they think the data\nmeans. The importance of perspective is compounded, here. They\nmight not be right. And even if they are mostly right, the systems\nscientists study are usually incredibly complex; one observation\nreport is not the whole picture.

But outsider status doesn\u2019t only mean a lack of\nexpertise. Your own, well-defined viewpoint might shed new light\non a topic that the experts haven\u2019t considered (or that your\nclassmates haven\u2019t considered, or that your professor hasn\u2019t\nmentionedinclass,oreven,quitesimply,thatyouhadn\u2019tthoughtof\nandsoyou\u2019reexcitedabout).Inthatcase,youwanttosay,\u201cThisis\nmine, it\u2019s a new way of looking at the issue, and I\u2019m proud of it.\u201d\nThose kinds of claims are usually synthetic ones\u2014you\u2019ve put\ninformation and\/or interpretations from several sources together,\nand you\u2019ve actually got something to say. Whether your new spin\nhas to do with a cure for cancer or an interpretation of Batman\ncomics, pride in your own intellectual work is important on many\nlevels. As a student, you should care; such investment can help\nyoulearn.Yourschoolcommunityshouldalsocare;goodteachers\nare always looking for what we call \u201ccritical thinking,\u201d and when\nstudents form new ideas from existing ones, we know it\u2019s\nhappening. On the larger scale, the scholarly community should\ncare. Having something new to say increases the exigency of your\nargument in the larger, intellectual exchange of ideas. A scholarly\nreader should want to pay attention, because what you say may\nbe a key to some puzzle (a cure for cancer) or way of thinking\naboutthetopic(interpretingBatman).That\u2019sthewayscholarswork\ntogethertoformlargebodiesofknowledge:wecommunicateabout\nour research and ideas, and we try to combine them when we can.\nAn emphatic statement like \u201cMuch discussion has addressed\nthe topic of carbon emissions\u2019 relationship to climate change, but\nI would like to ask a question from a new perspective,\u201d will make\nyour reader sit up and take notice.

Most involved writing\nassignments expect you to do at least two things. You may need\nto summarize\/report and respond, or (more likely) you\u2019ll need to\nsummarize\/report, synthesize, and respond. A good introduction,\nas you\u2019ve learned, needs to anticipate all of it so the reader knows\nwhat to expect. Anticipating the structure of a complex argument\nin I-less mode is tricky. Often, it comes out as a summary of the\ndocumentthatfollowsandisredundant.Firstpersoncanclearthat\nproblem right up. Consider the introduction to this article; when I\ncometothepartwhereIneedtotellyouwhatI\u2019mgoingtodo,Ijust\n. . . tell you what I\u2019m going to do! My writing students usually find\nthisrhetoricaltrick(orisitanun-trick?)refreshingandliberating.\nThe same concept can be applied to transitions between sections\nand ideas: \u201cNow that I\u2019ve done this thing, I\u2019d like to move into this\notherpartofmyargument...\u201dI\u2019llusethistypeoftransition,myself,\nI Need You to Say I | 117 whenImoveintothesectionofthistextcalled,\u201cWhen,andWhen\nnot?\u201d\nAcademic Examples\nThe fact is, using first person for rhetorical clarity and to ease\ntransitions isn\u2019t just easier\u2014it\u2019s common in many academic\ncontexts.It\u2019saccepted,evenexpected,insomecases,forscholarly\nwritingsuchasabstracts,positionpapers,theses,anddissertations\ninmanyfieldstoemployfirstpersoninthewaysI\u2019vejustdescribed.\nIn almost all genres, formats, and fields, the scholarly writer is\nexpected to describe the research done thus far by her peers and\nthen make her own claims\u2014a structure that lends itself to first\nperson.\nRobert Terrill, a cultural studies scholar, begins his article,\n\u201cPut on a Happy Face: Batman as Schizophrenic Savior,\u201d with an\nevaluation of Tim Burton\u2019s movie\u2019s box office success, and then\nspendsseveralparagraphsdiscussingotherscholars\u2019applicationsof\npsychologicalframeworkstofilmstudies.Throughouttheliterature\nreview section, Terrill\u2019s own voice stays remote; he uses third\nperson.Butlookatwhathappenswhenheisreadytobeginhisown\nargument:\nBecausemuchofmyanalysisisgroundedinthetheoriesof\nCarlC.Jung,Iwillbeginbyoutliningrelevantaspectsofthat\ntheory.ThenIsuggestthatGothamCityisadreamworld,a\nrepresentativeprojectionofimage-centereddreams.Within\nthe framework of Jung\u2019s model, I show the principal\ncharacters to be archetypal manifestations that erupt from\nGotham\u2019s unconscious.

Weaving Personal\nExperience into Academic\nWriting\nMARJORIE STEWART\nAbstract\nMarjorie Stewart\u2019s essay \u201cWeaving Personal Experience\ninto Academic Writing\u201d comes from the bookWriting\nSpaces: Readings on Writing, Volume 3.Stewart uses the\nmetaphor of weaving to demonstrate one way of using\npersonal and narrative writing within academic essays.\nRather than debate whether narrative is appropriate for\nacademic writing, it addresses the question of when is it\nappropriate and how it can be done effectively, focusing on\nhelping writers decide when the use of personal experience\nis appropriate for their purpose, how to make personal\nexperience and narrative pull its weight in the essay, and\nhow the ability to incorporate personal experience can\ntranslate into the ability to incorporate research.\nThe essay is structured as an example of the use of\npersonal experience as well as a how-to guide. \u201cWeaving\nPersonal Experience into Academic Writing\u201d contains a\ndiscussion of three students who incorporated narrative in\ntheir essays in three ways: as a structural frame, as an\nWeaving Personal Experience into Academic Writing | 125 example when the research topic and personal experience\noverlap, and as a tool for discovery. Students will benefit\nfrom the peer-written examples as well as the use of the\npersonal in the essay itself.\nThis reading is available below and as aPDF.\nOverview\n\u201cWarpandWeft\u201dusesthemetaphorofweavingtodemonstrateone\nwayofusingpersonalandnarrativewritingwithinacademicessays.\nRather than debate whether narrative is appropriate for academic\nwriting,itaddressesthequestionofwhenisitappropriateandhow\nitcanbedoneeffectively,focusingonhelpingwritersdecidewhen\nthe use of personal experience is appropriate for their purpose,\nhow to make personal experience and narrative pull its weight in\nthe essay, and how the ability to incorporate personal experience\ncan translate into the ability to incorporate research.

I was luckier than many of my classmates: I found a job at a\nhip little boutique called Rebecca: A Gallery of Wearable Art in the\n126 | Weaving Personal Experience into Academic Writing trendypartoftown.Wecarriedmanystylesofhand-madeclothing,\njewelry,andaccessories,butourmostimportantmerchandisewas\nthat made by Rebecca herself. Rebecca was a weaver who made\nhand-wovenclothingandscarves.Herloomtookuphalfoftheback\nroom and she wove while I waited on customers. When one fabric\ncame off the loom, Anne, the seamstress, would begin to cut and\nsewwhileRebeccasetuptheloomforthenextdesign.Shecreated\nher patterns then transferred them into a computer program that\ntold her how to thread the yarn onto the loom to produce the\npattern.Shethreadedthewarp,theyarnthatrunslengthwise,onto\ntheloom.Theweft(formerlyknownaswoof)wasplacedonbobbins\nthatfedtheshuttle.Theactofweavingwasmovingtheshuttlewith\nthe weft through the warp to create the weave.\nSowhat,youmightwellask.Sowhatdoesthishavetodowith\nwriting?\nManyofyouhavebeentaughtnottousetheword\u201cI\u201dinyour\nacademic writing; not to include anything that does not directly\nrelatetothatmysteriousthingcalleda\u201cthesisstatement;\u201dandnot\nto include anything personal in your writing.

My story of working in Rebecca\u2019s\nshop is useful here \u2013 it is intended to attract the attention of the\nreaders and to establish and explain the extended metaphor of\nweaving.However,ifIwerewritinganessayformyarthistoryclass\nabouttheevolutionofweavingtechniquesandequipment,mystory\nwouldseemoutofplace,asIonlyhaveexperiencewithonestepin\nthat evolution, and that experience is of an observer rather than a\nparticipant.\nYour composition professor will likely talk to you about the\nrhetorical situation of any piece of writing. Stated simply (perhaps\nWeaving Personal Experience into Academic Writing | 127 toosimply),therhetoricalsituation\u2013thewriter,theaudience,and\nthe purpose of the writing \u2013 affects the way the message is\npresented.Inmyhypotheticalarthistoryessay,thenarrativewould\nconfuse the reader as to the purpose of the project and distract\nfrom the actual message of the paper. Often in writing classes it\nseems that your audience is specifically your professor and\nsecondarily, perhaps, your classmates. Given the essays you will\nread about in this chapter, imagine the larger audiences that the\nstudent writers might have been addressing. Consider carefully\nwhether personal narrative belongs in papers you are writing for\nhistory, biology, or business classes.\nIn addition to your specific rhetorical situation, of course,\nyoushouldalwayscomplywithyourprofessors\u2019guidelinesforeach\nassignment. \u201cNo first-person narratives\u201d is a clear statement that\npersonal stories are not appropriate in that classroom.\nHowever, once you have established that your narrative is\nappropriate for your purpose and audience, what next? It is my\npurpose to help you incorporate narrative effectively, and to do\nthat, I will use examples from three of my students in a first-year\ncourse, a course designed to help writers bridge the gap between\nhigh school and college writing. I am also using the example of\nthis essay itself. Consider my story about Rebecca.

I assure my students that although they may not\nbefamiliarwiththeconceptofmultimodality,ithasalonghistory\nin composition (e.g. writing studies). In fact, the \u201cmultimodal\nassignment\u201d has been a fixture in some college writing classrooms\nforoveradecadeandcontinuestobeprevalentinmanyclassrooms.\nIn light of the probability that you will be asked to create a\nmultimodal text at some point in your academic and\/or\nprofessionalcareer,Iwrotethischaptertohelpyouunderstandand\nnavigate multimodal composing. In the first half of this chapter, I\nprovide brief definitions of terms associated with and explain the\nimportanceofmultimodalcomposing.Theremainderofthechapter\noffersstrategiesforcomposingamultimodaltextwithanemphasis\non pre-drafting strategies.\nAn Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing | 143 What Is a Multimodal Text?\nBefore moving into a discussion of multimodality and modes of\ncommunication, it is important to understand the meaning of the\nword \u201ctext\u201d because it is often only associated with writing (or\nperhaps the messages you receive or write on your phone).\nHowever, when we use the term \u201ctext\u201d in composition courses,\nwe often mean it is a piece of communication that can take many\nforms. For instance, a text is a movie, meme, social media post,\nessay, website, podcast, and the list goes on. In our daily lives, we\nencounter,interactwith,andconsumemanytypesoftexts,anditis\nimportant to consider how most texts are also multimodal.\nPamelaTakayoshiandCynthiaL.Selfe,twoimportantscholars\nin writing studies and early advocates of multimodal composing,\ndefine multimodal texts as \u201ctexts that exceed the alphabetical and\nmayincludestillandmovingimages,animators,color,words,music,\nandsound\u201d(1).You\u2019llnoticethattheexamplesof\u201ctext\u201dlistedabove\nare also multimodal, which demonstrates how often we encounter\nmultimodality in our daily lives. Multimodality is sometimes\nassociated with technology and\/or digital writing spaces. For\nexample,whenyoupostanimagetoInstagram,youusetechnology\n(yourphone)tosnapapicture,anapptoeditormodifytheimage,\nand a social media platform (Instagram) to share it with others.\nHowever, creating a multimodal text does not require the use of\ndigital tools and\/or does not need to be shared in online digital\nspaces to make it \u201cmultimodal.\u201d To illustrate, when you create a\ncollage and post it on your dorm room door, you use existing\nprinted artifacts such as pictures clipped and pasted (non-digital\ntechnologies) from a magazine and share with others by taping\nit to your door (a non-digital space). Both examples represent a\nmultimodal text because they include various modes of\ncommunication.\n144 | An Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing The Five Modes of Communication\nInthemid-1990s,agroupofscholarsgatheredinNewLondon,New\nHampshire and, based on their discussions, wrote the influential\narticle, \u201cA Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures,\u201d\npublished in 1996. In it, the group advocated for teachers to\nembrace teaching practices that allow students to draw from five\nsociallyandculturallysituatedmodes,or\u201cway[s]ofcommunicating\u201d\n(Arola, Sheppard, and Ball 1). These modes were linguistic, visual,\nspatial, gestural, and aural. Yet, scholars such as Claire Lauer,\nanotherinfluentialresearcherincomposition,havearguedthatthe\nNew London Group\u2019s definition of modes, while exceedingly\nimportant,canbedifficulttograsp.Inlightofthis,belowIprovide\nbrief definitions of each mode as well as examples to help you\nunderstand the \u201cmode\u201d in \u201cmultimodal.\u201d\nWhat Are the modes of communication?\nThevisualmodereferstowhatanaudiencecansee,suchasmoving\nand still images, colors, and alphabetical text size and style. Social\nmedia photos (see figure 1) exemplify the visual mode.\nAn Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing | 145 The linguistic mode refers to alphabetic text or spoken word. Its\nemphasis is on language and how words are used (verbally or\nwritten). A traditional five paragraph essay relies on the linguistic\nmode; however, this mode is also apparent in some digital texts.\nFigure 2 shows a student\u2019s linguistic text included in their website\ncreated to promote game-based language learning.\n146 | An Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing Thespatialmodereferstohowatextdealswithspace.Thisalso\nrelates to how other modes are arranged, organized, emphasized,\nand contrasted in a text. Figure 3, an infographic, is an example of\nthespatialmodeinusebecauseitemphasizescertainpercentages\nand words to achieve its goal.\nAn Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing | 147 The gestural mode refers to gesture and movement.

Figure 4\nshows Michelle Obama\u2019s gestures at a speech she gave in London.\n148 | An Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing The aural mode refers to what an audience member can or\ncannothear.Musicisthemostobviousrepresentationoftheaural\nmode, but an absence of sound (silence) is also aural. Examples of\ntextsthatemphasizetheauralmodeincludepodcasts,musicvideos,\nconcerts,televisionseries,movies,andradiotalkshows.Figure5is\nascreenshotofmystudent\u2019spodcastcreatedtoconvinceteachers\nAn Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing | 149 tointegratepodcastsintotheirlanguageartsclassrooms.Apodcast\nexemplifies the aural mode because of its reliance on sound.\nA multimodal text combines various modes of communication\n(hence the combination of the words \u201cmultiple\u201d and \u201cmode\u201d in the\nterm \u201cmulti- modal\u201d). Cheryl E. Ball and Colin Charlton draw from\nTheNewLondonGroupintheirargumentthat\u201c[a]nycombination\nof modes makes a multimodal text, and all text\u2014every piece of\ncommunication a human composes\u2014use more than one mode.\nThus, all writing is multimodal\u201d (42). However, in some\ncommunicative texts, one mode receives more emphasis than the\nothers. For example, academia and writing teachers have\nhistorically favored the linguistic mode, often seen in the form of\nthe written college essay. Yet, when you communicate using an\nessay, you are actually using three modes of communication:\nlinguistic, spatial, and visual. The words represent the linguistic\nmode(theemphasizedmode),themarginsandspacingcharacterize\nthe spatial, and the visual mode includes elements like font, font\nsize, or the use of bold.\nCombining each mode to create a clear communicative essay\noften involves the writing process (i.e. invention, drafting, and\nrevision), and a thoughtful writer will also consider how the final\nproductdoesordoesnotaddressanaudience.Thesameprocessis\nusedwhencreatingalesstraditionalmultimodaltext.Forinstance,\n150 | An Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing when creating a text emphasizing the aural mode (e.g. a podcast),\nyou must consider your audience, purpose, and context while also\norganizingandarrangingyourideasandcontentinacoherentand\nlogical way. This process parallels the traditional writing process.\nThus,whileamultimodaltextmightbeconsideredless\u201cacademic\u201d\nbysomestudentsand\/orinstructors,understandingthatallwriting\nandalltextsarealsomultimodaldemonstratesthatlearningabout\nmultimodality and how to multimodally compose is just as\nimportant as learning how to write.\nWhy Is Multimodal Composing Important?\nYoumightbewonderingwhyyoushouldmultimodallycompose\nin a college writing class. In this section, I provide some answers\ntothisquestion.Iexplainhowmultimodalcomposingassignments\nhelp students practice digital literacy skills, offer an opportunity\nto transfer multimodal composing experiences from home to\nacademicsettings,andallowstudentstolearn\u201creallife\u201dcomposing\npractices.\nMultimodal Assignments Help You Learn Digital\nLiteracy Skills\nYou have likely been taught that to succeed in the world, you\nneed to become a literate citizen. The common understanding of\n\u201cliterate\u201dor\u201cliteracy\u201disanabilitytoreadandwritealphabetictexts.\nWhile it is important to have these skills, this definition privileges\nwords and language over the other modes of communication. It\nalso does not allow for assignments that help you practice\ncommunicatingusingmultipleliteracies,modesofcommunication,\nand technologies in various and diverse writing situations.\nAn Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing | 151 The New London Group members were some of the first\nto argue that students should have opportunities to practice and\nlearn multiple literacies in the classroom, while utilizing emerging\ntechnologies. This idea continues to be reflected in writing and\nliteracy goals in many first year writing and writing across the\ncurriculum courses. In fact, check out your syllabus; in many\ncolleges and universities there is a goal related to \u201cdigital literacy.\u201d\nThe 2000s saw the arrival of \u201cdigital literacy skills\u201d added to many\nfirst year writing program\u2019s learning outcomes and include\nunderstanding how to react to different writing assignments that\nrequire composing practices beyond writing a college essay and\nlearninghowtousevarioustechnologiestoappropriatelydistribute\ninformation. Multimodal assignments offer opportunities for\ninstructors to help you learn these digital literacy skills.\nMultimodal Assignments Allow You to Use What\nYou Know\nYou are likely already sharing and creating multimodal texts\nonlineandcommunicatingwithawiderangeofaudiencesthrough\nsocial media, which Ryan P. Shepherd argues, requires\nmultimodality. However, in his 2018 study, Shepherd also points\nout that students struggle to perceive the connections between\nthe digital and multimodal composing they do outside of school\nwith the same types of assignments they are asked to complete\nin school. What does this mean? Well, it means you are probably\nalready multimodally composing outside of school but you just\ndidn\u2019t know it. Understanding that you are already composing\nmultimodally in many digital spaces will help you transfer that\nknowledge and experience into your academic assignments. This\nunderstanding might also help alleviate any fears or anxiety you\nmay have when confronted with an assignment that disrupts what\nyou think writing should look like. You can take a deep breath\n152 | An Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing and remember that practicing multimodal composing in school\nconnects to the multimodal composing you likely practice outside\nof school.\nMultimodal Assignments Offer Real Skills for the\nWorkforce\nPerhapsthemostsignificantreasonforlearninghowtocompose\nmultimodally is that it provides \u201creal-life\u201d skills that can help\nprepare students for careers. The United States continues to\nexperience a \u201cdigital age\u201d where employees are expected to have\nan understanding of how to use technology and communicate in\nvarious ways for various purposes.

Additionally, professionals are also\nusing the benefits of digital tools and multimodal composing to\npromotethemselves,theirinterests,research,orallthree.Learning\nhowtocreateamultimodaltextwillprepareyoufortheworkforce\nby allowing you to embrace the skills you already have and learn\nhow to target specific audiences for specific reasons using various\nmodes of communication.\nHow Do I Create a Multimodal Text?\nNow that you know what a multimodal text is and why it is\nimportant to learn how to create them, it makes sense to discuss\nstrategies for composing a multimodal text. As with writing,\nmultimodalcomposingisaprocessandshouldnotonlyemphasize\nthefinalresult.Therefore,thefirstthreestrategieslistedbeloware\npre-drafting activities.\nAn Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing | 153 1. Determine your rhetorical situation.\n2. Review and analyze other multimodal texts.\n3. Gather content, media, and tools.\n4. Cite and attribute information appropriately.\n5. Begin drafting your text.\nWhileIoftenaskmystudentstoattendtoeachstrategyintheorder\ngiven,yourprocessmightchangebasedontheassignmentand\/or\ninstructor expectations.\nDetermine Your Rhetorical Situation\nWhenbrainstormingyourrhetoricalsituation,youshouldconsider\nthe purpose of your text (the message), who you want to read and\ninteract with your text (the audience), your relationship to the\nmessage and audience (the author), the type of text you want to\ncreate(thegenre),andwhereyouwanttodistributeit(themedium).\nDescriptions of each of the five components of the rhetorical\nsituation are offered below.\nThe Message\nThe message relates to your purpose, and you might ask yourself,\nwhatamItryingtoaccomplish?Youshouldtrytomakethemessage\nas clear and specific as possible. Let\u2019s say you want to create a\nwebsitefocusedondonatingtocharity.Anunclearmessagemight\nbe\u201cgettingmorepeopleintheUnitedStatestodonatetocharities.\u201d\nAclearermessageis\u201cconvincingcollegefreshmenatmyuniversity\nto donate to the ASPCA\u201d because the audience and purpose are\nspecific rather than broad.\n154 | An Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing The Audience\nThere are two types of audiences. An intended audience, who you\ntarget in your message, and an unintentional audience, who may\nstumbleuponyourtext.Whendeterminingyourmessage,youwant\ntoconsiderthebeliefs,values,anddemographicsofyourintended\naudienceaswellasthelikelihoodthatunintentionalaudienceswill\ninteractwithyourtext.Usingtheexampleabove,collegefreshmen\natyouruniversityaretheintendedaudience,andteachers,parents,\nand\/or students from other universities represent unintentional\naudiencemembers.Itmightbehelpfultoapproachaudienceusing\nthe concept of \u201cdiscourse communities,\u201d or \u201ca group of people,\nmembers of a community, who share a common interest and who\nuse the same language, or discourse, as they talk and write about\nthatinterest\u201d(NationalCouncilofTeachersofEnglish).Youcanread\nmore about discourse communities in Dan Melzer\u2019s essay, \u201cYou\u2019ll\nNever Write Alone Again: Understanding Discourse Communities\u201d\nfound in this volume ofWriting Spaces.\nThe Author\nYou are the author and should consider your relationship to the\nmessage and audience. As an author, you bring explicit (obvious)\nand\/or implicit (not obvious) biases to your message, so it is\nimportanttorecognizehowthesemightaffectitandyouraudience.\nAlso, you may be targeting an audience you are familiar with\n(perhaps you are also a college freshman) or not (perhaps you are\na graduate student). It is important to think about how your\nfamiliarity might affect your message.\nAn Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing | 155 The Genre\nGenre is a tricky term and can mean different things to different\nscholars, teachers, and students (Dirk 250). In the context of\nmultimodalcomposing,genrereferstoatypeoftextthathasgenre\nconventions,oraudienceexpectations.Forexample,ifIamcreating\na website (the genre), an audience would expect the following\nconventions: an easy-to-navigate toolbar, functional tabs,\nhyperlinks, and images. Yet, when thinking about genre, it is more\nuseful to think specifically. If I am creating a website for horror\nfilm fans (the specific genre), then the audience would expect the\nfollowing(morespecific)genreconventions:references,images,and\nsounds associated with horror films, directors, actors, actresses,\nmonsters, and villains. They would also expect color and font\nchoicestoalignwiththegenre\u2014itislikelythatthecolorbabyblue\nwould not be well-received.\nThe Medium\nWhile genre is the type of text you want to create, the medium\nrefers to where you will distribute it. Classic media (plural for\nmedium) includes distribution via radio, newspapers, magazines,\nand television; however, new media is defined by a text\u2019s online\ndistribution. Importantly, medium refers to where you will\ndistributeyourtextbutnothow.Thehowreferstothetechnology\ntools you\u2019ll use to create the text and possibly to distribute it. For\nexample, to create a podcast, you might use your smartphone (a\ntool) to record, a free sound editor like Audacity (another tool) to\nedit it, and Soundcloud (a toolandthe medium) to distribute it.\n156 | An Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing Review and Analyze Other Multimodal Texts\nNow that you have brainstormed your rhetorical situation and\ndetermined the type of text you want to create, it is time to begin\nfindingothertextsrepresentativeofyourtopicandgenre.Intheir\ntextbook, Writer\/Designer: A Guide to Making Multimodal Projects,\nArola,Sheppard,andBallarguethat\u201c[o]neofthebestwaystobegin\nthinkingaboutamultimodalprojectistoseewhathasalreadybeen\nsaid about a topic you are interested in . . . as well as how other\nauthors have designed their texts on that topic . . . \u201d (40).

I have categorized this process into three components:\ncontent, visual and aural materials, and technology tools.\nConduct Content Research\nAmultimodaltextshouldincludecontent(keypiecesofinformation\nthatsupportyourmessage),whichmeansyouwillneedtoconduct\nsome research. The extent of the research depends on the type of\nassignment; some instructors might want your multimodal text to\ninclude scholarly research while others might not. Therefore, be\nsuretoreadtheassignmentcloselyandthenconductthenecessary\nresearch. For example, my student created a website and videos\ndiscussingthesimilaritiesbetweenAmericanmusicandK-pop(see\nfigure6).Hercontentresearchincludesascholarlyarticlefromthe\njournalWorld Englishesand a popular article fromBillboard.com.\n158 | An Introduction to and Strategies for Multimodal Composing Collect Visual and Aural Materials\nIn addition to textual information, you should also collect images,\nsounds,videos,animations,memes,etc.youwanttoincludeinyour\nmultimodal text. For instance, figure 6 demonstrates some of the\npre-draftmaterialsmystudentcollected:openlylicensedimagesof\nateacherandchalkboard,avideotheycreatedusingAnimator,and\nK-Pop music to play on a loop.\nExplore Openly Licensed Materials\nWhensearchingforvisualandauralmaterials,youwanttoconsider\nusing openly licensed materials.

You may also set filters on Flickr or\nGoogle Images to locate openly licensed work.\nCollect and Evaluate Technology Tools\nIt is important to collect and evaluate the technology tools you\nneed to create your multimodal text prior to drafting it.

Bad Idea About Writing:\n\"There is One Correct Way of\nWriting and Speaking\"\nANJALI PATTANAYAK\nAbstract\n\u201cThere is One Correct Way of Writing and Speaking\u201d by\nAnjali Pattanayak comes fromBad Ideas About Writing,\nedited by Cheryl E. Ball and Drew M. Loewe. This article\nfocuses on the myth that there is only one way to read and\nwrite successfully in our world. Pattanayak dispels this\nposition by speaking to the ways in which holding tightly to\nsuch beliefs can limit writing diversity and further\nmarginalize those who have specific cultural linguistic\nstyles that connect deeply with their identity.\nThis reading is available below, as aPDF, and as a\npodcast.\nPeopleconsistentlylamentthatkidstodaycan\u2019tspeakproperlyor\nthatpeoplecomingtothiscountryneedtolearntowritecorrectly.\nThese lamentations are based on the notion that there is a single\ncorrect way of speaking and writing. Currently, the general\nsentimentisthatpeopleshouldjustlearntospeakandwriteproper\nBad Idea About Writing: \"There is One Correct Way of Writing and\nSpeaking\" | 167 English. This understanding of writing is rooted called current\ntraditional rhetoric, which focuses on a prescriptive and formulaic\nwayofteachingwritingthatassumesthereisonlyonewaytowrite\n(or speak) something for it to be correct. However, over the past\nseveraldecades,scholarsinwritingstudieshaveexaminedtheways\nin which writing has a close dialectical relationship with identity,\nstyle genre, and culture. In other words, the rules for writing shift\nwiththepeopleandthecommunityinvolvedaswellasthepurpose\nand type of writing.\nMost people implicitly understand that the way they\ncommunicatechangeswithdifferentgroupsofpeople,frombosses\nto work colleagues to peers to relatives. They understand that\nconversations that may be appropriate over a private dinner may\nnot be appropriate at the workplace. These conversational shifts\nmightbesubtle,buttheyaredistinct.Whilemostpeopleacceptand\nunderstand these nuances exist and will adapt to these unspoken\nrules\u2014 and while we have all committed a social faux pas when\nwedidn\u2019tunderstandtheseunspokenrules\u2014wedonotoftenafford\nthis same benefit of the doubt to people who are new to our\ncommunities or who are learning our unspoken rules.\nWhiletheideaofarguingwhetherthereisonecorrectwayof\ncommunicatingorwhetherwritingisculturallysituatedmightseem\ntobeapedanticexercise,therealityisthatespousingtheideology\nthat there is one correct way to speak and write disenfranchises\nmany populations who are already denigrated by society.

In adhering to so-called correct\nlanguage,wearedevaluingthenon-standarddialects,cultures,and\ntherefore identities of people and their communicative situations\nthat do not fit a highly limited mold.\nThe way in which correctness in language devalues people is\nalreadytroubling,butitbecomesexacerbatedbythecurrenttrends\nineducation.Pleaserefertotheliterarycrisischaptertolearnmore\naboutthechangingdynamicsineducation.Giventhisshiftandthe\nwaythatStandardWrittenEnglishisdeeplyrootedinwhiteupper\/\n168 | Bad Idea About Writing: \"There is One Correct Way of Writing and\nSpeaking\" middle-classculture,weseemoreandmorestudentsfromdiverse\nbackgroundsgainingaccesstocollegewhoarefacingbarriersdue\nto their linguistic backgrounds.\nThis means that while minority students and lower class\nstudents are ostensibly being given greater access to education,\ncareers,andotherfacetsofsocietytheyhadbeenpreviouslybarred\nfrom, they are still facing serious barriers that their upper-class\nwhite counterparts do not, particularly in terms of culture,\nlanguage,andliteracy.J.ElspethStuckeyarguesthatliteracy,rather\nthan enfranchising students, is a means of oppression and that\nit does little to help the economic futures of minority students\nbecause of how literacy teaches a particular set of values\u2014ways of\ncommunicatingandidentity.Inthecontextofeducationalsettings,\ntheculturesandidentitiesofacademiaarevaluedmorethanthose\nof the students, which sends the message that how they, their\nfamily, and members in their community speak and act are wrong\nby comparison. In essence, it sends the message starting at a very\nyoungagethatwhotheyareandwheretheycomefromissomehow\nlesser.\nIn this sense, education, while well intentioned, serves to\nfurther the marginalization of certain identities and cultures that\ndo not fit. This is particularly evident in Latino, African American,\nand English as Second Language communities. In the book Paying\nfor the Party, Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton note that\ncolleges like the school they studied for five years, which they call\nMidwestern University, do not help facilitate social mobility.\nFrequently, the students who entered college best prepared were\nthose who were already middle or upper class, meaning the\nopportunitiestheworking-andlower-classstudentsreceivedwere\nmorelimited.WhenyoulookatthisalongsidewhatGloriaLadson-\nBillings calls the educational debt, or the compounded impact of\neducational deficits that grow across generations of poor minority\nstudents,literacyeffortsastheyarecurrentlyframedpaintableak\npicture for poor, minority students.\nThe issue is not just one of unequal access to opportunities.\nBad Idea About Writing: \"There is One Correct Way of Writing and\nSpeaking\" | 169 Jacqueline Jones Royster and Carmen Kynard illustrate how\nattitudestowardstudentsaswritersareinterwovenwithattitudes\ntoward them as people. Language cannot be disassociated from\npeople,whichhasimportantconsequencesforthosewhogrowup\nspeakingdifferentdialects.Bycontinuingtopropagatethenotionof\ncorrect and incorrect ways of speaking, we effectively devalue the\nintelligence and character of students, employees, and colleagues,\nwho, for whatever reasons, don\u2019t speak or write what in historical\nterms has been called the King\u2019s English (among other names). We\nuse the perception of improper communication as evidence of\nothers\u2019 lesser character or ability, despite recognizing that this\ncountry was united (if only in name) after declaring independence\nfrom that King.\nThisperceptionbecomesallthemoreproblematicbecauseit\nis not just about devaluing individuals, but about the widespread\npracticeofdevaluingtheliteratepracticesofthosewhoarealready\nmarginalized.DavidGoldhighlightsthemarginalizationofwomen,\nworking class, rural, and African American literacy in our\nunderstanding of writing. Gold writes about how the literacy\npractices of African Americans in universities laid the groundwork\nfortheCivilRightsmovement.Indeed,theschoolshestudiedwere\ndecades ahead of the larger national conversation on how literacy,\nidentity, and power were interrelated. In her work examining how\nliteracy and identity formation were key for African American\nwomen and for social change, Jacqueline Jones Royster discusses\nthe importance of understanding the these cultural, identity, and\nsocialmovements,echoingtheimpactmarginalizedscholarshadin\nacademia. Both demonstrate the detrimental impact of sidelining\ngroups of people and their literate practices by devaluing their\nlanguages and their experiences, not just for those who are\nmarginalized but for our larger understanding of how we as a\nsociety write.\nThe notion of one correct way of writing is also troubling\nbecauseitoperatesundertheassumptionthatlinguisticdifferences\nare the result of error. The reality is that, for many speakers, what\n170 | Bad Idea About Writing: \"There is One Correct Way of Writing and\nSpeaking\" we might perceive as a mistake is actually a system of difference.\nOne notable example of a different dialect of English is Ebonics,\nwhich has different patterns of speech rooted in the ancestral\nheritageofitsspeakers.Similarly,immigrantgroupswillfrequently\nspeakandwriteEnglishinawaythatmirrorsthelinguisticheritage\nof their mother tongue.\nThewaythatweconceptualizelanguageisnotjustdetrimental\nto minorities; it also devalues the identities that working- and\nlower-classpeoplebringtocommunicativesituations,includingthe\nclassroom. Lynn Z. Bloom writes that \u201cFreshman Composition is\nan unabashedly middle-class enterprise.\u201d She argues that one of\nthe reasons composition is required for all students is because it\npromulgatesmiddle-classvaluesandwaysofthinking.Thesevalues\nin the writing classroom are embodied in everything from the\nnotion of property, which undergirds the way that plagiarism and\nintellectual property are treated, to formality of language and\nrhetorical choices that are encouraged in papers. Indeed, the way\nmany instructors teach writing, plagiarism, citation, and word\nchoiceinpapersisnotinandofitselfgoodbutratheristhesocially\nacceptedwayofinteractingwithtextasdefinedbythemiddleclass.\nMike Rose and Irvin Peckham write about the tension of middle-\nclassvaluesonworking-classstudentsandthecognitivedissonance\nandstruggleswithidentitythatcomewithimposingsuchvaluesin\nwriting under the guise of correctness. The idea that there is one\ncorrectwayofwritingdevaluesthewriting,thoughts,intelligence,\nand identities of people from lower-class backgrounds.\nPragmatically, many argue that standard English should be\ndominant in the binary between academic English and all other\ndialects in order for speakers and writers to communicate with\ncredibility in their communities. This argument has been used to\njustify the continued attention to correctness at the expense of\nauthors\u2019voices,butwecanteachpeopletoadaptwhilealsovaluing\ntheir identities. We can talk about writing as something that they\ncanemploytotheirbenefitratherthanahegemonicstandardthat\nsupersedes their backgrounds, identities, and experiences.\nBad Idea About Writing: \"There is One Correct Way of Writing and\nSpeaking\" | 171 Inordertovaluethediversityofcommunicationandidentities\nthat exist in the U.S., we need to start teaching and envisioning\nwriting as a cultural and social activity. We need a more nuanced\nviewofwritinginsocietythatencourageseveryonetoadapttotheir\naudiences and contexts rather than placing an undue burden on\nthosewhodonotfitthemoldofstandardEnglish.Onestrategyfor\nteaching academic English without devaluing a writer\u2019s identity is\ncode-switching,aconceptalreadytaughtinschoolswithsignificant\nminoritypopulationsasawayofempoweringyoungpeople.While\ninstruction in code-switching is valuable because it teaches\nstudents that they can adopt different linguistic choices to appeal\nto different audiences, it is deeply problematic that the impetus\nis still placed on minority students with non-standard dialects to\nadapt.Whilecode-switchingismeanttoempowerpeople,itisstill\nrooted in the mentality that there is one correct way of writing,\nbecauseevenascode-switchingteachesanincrediblynuancedway\nof thinking about writing, it is still being taught in the context of\npreparingwriterstodealwithasocietythatwilluseerrorsinspeak-\ningasevidencethattheyarelesser.Asaresult,itisaless-than-ideal\nsolutionbecauseitplaysinto\u2014ratherthanundermines\u2014theracism\nof academic English.\nBy perpetuating the myth of one correct way of writing, we\nare effectively marginalizing substantial swaths of the population\nlinguistically and culturally. The first step in combating this is as\neasy as recognizing how correctness reinforces inequality and\naffects our own perceptions of people and questioning our\nassumptions about communication, and a second step is valuing\ncode-switching in a wide swath of communicative situations.\nFurther Reading\nWhile the notion of what constitutes academic English has\nremained relatively static in popular culture, the reality of writing\n172 | Bad Idea About Writing: \"There is One Correct Way of Writing and\nSpeaking\" in the university has broadened to include many other types of\nwriting.

Bad Idea About Writing:\n\"Failure is Not an Option\"\nALLISON D. CARR\nAbstract\nAllison D. Carr\u2019s essay \u201cFailure is Not an Option\u201d comes\nfrom the bookBad Ideas About Writing.In Carr\u2019s essay, she\ndraws on both personal experiences of failure and research\nto suggest that failure is an important part of the writing\nprocess. Carr argues that instead of avoiding failure we\nneed to change our orientation toward failure, which is not\nan easy thing to do.\nThis reading is available below, as aPDF, and as a\npodcast.\nFailure, so goes the dominant cultural narrative, is a sign of\nweakness.

To writing especially,\nfailure is integral, and I will go so far as to assert that the best\nwriting (and the best learning-to-write) happens when one\napproaches the activity from a mindset trained on failure. Failure\nrepresents a certain against-the-grain jettisoning of established\nideasaboutwhatcountsasgoodwritinginfavorofrogue,original,\nattention-capturing, and intentional art. To fail willingly in writing\nis to be empowered by the possibilities that emerge. It is to trust\noneself and one\u2019s ideas, a quality too rare in the age of hyper-\nachievement,inwhichtheonlyprogressthatcountsisprogressthat\nmoves up.\nA History of Failure\nBroadly speaking, failure\u2019s bad reputation is an inherited relic\nof another time.

From this backdrop grew the recognition that literacy, the\nability to read and write (and generally comprehend information),\nwould be the bedrock of a thriving community. Thus, literacy took\nonthestatusofsocialnecessityforthemasses,notsimplyaluxury\n176 | Bad Idea About Writing: \"Failure is Not an Option\" for the ruling class. By the middle of the 19th century, a system of\ncommon schools had been codified, and central to its curriculum\nwas grammar instruction and conventions of speech and writing.\nAccordingtoliteracyscholarJohnTrimbur,fromwhomIhave\nbeen piecing together this history, reading and writing instruction\nfunctioned\u201casbothameanstoregulatepopularliteracyandasocial\nmarker to divide the literate from the illiterate, the worthy poor\nfromtheunworthy,\u2018us\u2019from\u2018them.\u2019\u201dGiventhethen-corresponding\n(perhaps correlative) rates of illiteracy among incarcerated\npopulations,successandfailureinthisrealmcametobeperceived\nnot simply as an indication of intelligence or economic advantage,\nbutasamatterofmoralfiber.Tofailinreadingorwritingmeanta\nfailure of moral fortitude.\nButculturalattitudestowardfailureremainassinisterasever,\nperhapsmoresointhewakeofstandardizedtesting,NoChildLeft\nBehind, and Race to the Top.

And there is something about\nfailureinwritingthatamplifiesthesejudgments,suggestingthatthe\nsubjectsomehowdeservestobejudgedanddisadvantagedinthese\nways.\nAn Alternative View\nWhat we have failed to grasp\u2014why the idea that failure is bad\nneeds to die\u2014is the integral connection between failure and risk,\ncreativity, and innovation, not to mention emotional and cognitive\nresilience. This relationship is well documented, making its\ntenacious hold on cultural ideology especially confounding. For\nexample, many of us use and benefit daily from innovations\ndiscovered by accident: penicillin, Corn Flakes, Post-it Notes,\nCorningware, WD-40, oral contraception, and potato chips. All of\nthese were discovered when the discoverer was working on a\nBad Idea About Writing: \"Failure is Not an Option\" | 177 different puzzle. And discoveries like these are the norm, not the\nexception. This is the primary activity of lab research, after all: A\nresearchermayrunhundreds,thousandsoftrialsandexperiments,\neachafailureinitsownuniqueway(andsomeleadingtoaccidental\ndiscoveries) before landing on, say, the polio vaccine or the secret\nto the expanding universe.

Writing is not a list of dos\nand don\u2019ts, nor is success in writing a universally acknowledged\nideal. Writing is about risk and wonder and a compulsion to make\n180 | Bad Idea About Writing: \"Failure is Not an Option\" something known.

Bad Idea About Writing:\n\"Strong Writing and Writers\nDon\u2019t Need Revision\"\nLAURA GIOVANELLI\nAbstract\nLaura Giovanelli\u2019s essay \u201cStrong Writing and Writers\nDon\u2019t Need Revision\u201d comes from the bookBad Ideas About\nWriting. She argues that revision is not simply a matter of\naddressing localized concerns such as grammar and\nspelling, but looking at more global, all-encompassing\nissues within a piece such as development and\norganization.

What writers need is revision. Novice\nwriters, experienced writers, all writers. Anyone interested in\nwriting clearer, stronger, more persuasive and passionate prose,\neven those of us who are procrastinators panicking because we\nneed to get a project finished or a paper written and it\u2019s 2:00 a.m.\nthe night before our deadline\u2014writers need revision because\nrevision is not a discrete step. Revision is not the thing writers do\nwhen they\u2019re done writing. Revision is the writing.\nIt\u2019simportanttokeepinmindI\u2019mnottalkingaboutrevisionas\nproofreading or copy editing; no amount of grammatical, spelling,\nand style corrections transforms a piece of writing like focused\nattention to fundamental questions about purpose, evidence, and\norganization. That, to me, is revision: the heavy lifting of working\nthrough why I\u2019m writing, who I\u2019m writing for, and how I structure\nwriting logically and effectively.\nRevision is Writing\nMy writing students are usually relieved to hear that published\nauthors often find writing just as fraught as they do. Like first-\nyearcollegestudents,peoplepaidtowrite\u2014thejournalistsandthe\nnovelists and the technical writers\u2014more often than not despair\nat the difference between what\u2019s in their heads and hearts and\nwhat ends up on the page the first time around. The professionals\nare just a little better at waiting things out, pushing through what\nAnne Lamott calls \u201cshitty first drafts\u201d and all the ones that follow,\nthe revision of a tenth and a thirteenth and a twenty-third draft. I\nshow a YouTube video by Tim Weninger, a computer scientist and\nengineer at the University of Notre Dame. In the video, Weninger\nstitches together his revisions of a research paper. In my class,\nwe play a game, guessing how many revisions Weninger did. The\nanswer\u2014463!\u2014almost always surprises them. It still sometimes\n184 | Bad Idea About Writing: \"Strong Writing and Writers Don\u2019t Need\nRevision\" surprises me. And sure, some of those revisions are small, fiddly\nchanges. But most of the time, even watching this quickly on\nclassroom monitors, my students notice Weninger aims for the\njugularinhiswriting.He\u2019safterwholesaleoverhaulofhisargument\nand of his larger work.\nHowever,talkingaboutrevisionintermsofnumbersofdrafts\nimplies that all writing, all writers, and all revision work one way:\nhit your target draft number, like your daily Fitbit goals, and you\nmagically get good writing. But more revision isn\u2019t necessarily\nbetter. Effective revising isn\u2019t making changes for the sake of\nchange, but instead making smarter changes. And professional\nwriters\u2014practiced writers\u2014have this awareness even if they aren\u2019t\naware of it. In Stephen King\u2019s memoir On Writing, he calls this\ninstinct the ideal reader: an imagined person a writer knows and\ntrusts but rewrites in response to, a kind of collaborative dance\nbetween writer and reader. To writers, the act of writing is an\nact of thinking. One writer in a landmark study of comparing the\nhabits of experienced writers to those of novices called their first\ndrafts \u201cthe kernel.\u201d If you\u2019re someone like me who is constantly\nstrugglingtodemystifythiscomplexcognitivethingwehumansdo,\nthat metaphor of writing as a seed is revelatory. Revision is not a\nsignofweaknessorinexperiencedorpoorwriting.Itisthewriting.\nThemorewriterspushthroughchaostogettothegoodstuff,the\nmore they revise. The more writers revise, whether that be the\nkeystrokes they sweat in front of a blinking, demanding cursor or\ntheunofficialrevisingtheydoinourheadswhenthey\u2019reshowering\nor driving or running, the more the ideal reader becomes a part\nof their craft and muscle memory, of who they are as writers, so\natsomepointtheymaynotknowwherethewritingstopsandthe\nrevision begins.\nBecause writing and revision are impossible to untangle,\nrevision is just as situational and interpretive as writing. In other\nwords, writers interact with readers\u2014writing and revision are\nsocial, responsive, and communal. Take Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s \u201cI\nHaveaDream\u201dspeech.Kinggavearoughdraftofthemostfamous\nBad Idea About Writing: \"Strong Writing and Writers Don\u2019t Need\nRevision\" | 185 Americanspeechofthe20thcenturyto1,800peoplecrammedinto\nagymnasiuminRockyMount,NorthCarolina,inNovemberof1962.\nSeven months later, King gave another revision of the speech to a\ngathering of political and spiritual leaders, musicians, and activists\ninDetroit.InAugustof1963,infrontoftheLincolnMemorial,King\nriffed and reworked and rebuilt what he preached in Rocky Mount\nandDetroit,ad-libbing,deleting,andflippinglines.\u201cIHaveaDream\u201d\nis what Americans remember today, engraved in our collective\nmemories,archives,andtextbooksassymbolsofanentireera,but\nKing\u2019s famous refrain singing his vision for a less racially divided\ncountrywasnotevenpartofhisspeech\u2019sofficialtextthatday.Was\nKing writing a new speech?

Introduction to Primary\nResearch: Observations,\nSurveys, and Interviews\nDANA LYNN DRISCOLL\nAbstract\nDana Driscoll\u2019s essay \u201cIntroduction to Primary Research:\nObservations, Surveys, and Interviews\u201d comes from the\nbookWriting Spaces: Readings on Writings, Volume 2.\nProjects where students are asked to gather first-hand data\nare a common occurrence infirst-year composition(FYC).\nHowever, FYC students may struggle with the ethical and\npractical issues of collecting, analyzing, and writing about\nsurvey results, interviews, and observations. This chapter\nintroduces definitions of research from an interdisciplinary\nperspective, examines ethical considerations, and\ncompares the research process to the writing process. The\nchapter concludes with information about writing from\nprimary research, including integrating research and\ncreating visuals. Two student examples \u2013 a nutrition\nobservation\/survey project and an agricultural and\nbiological engineering interview project \u2013 are provided to\ngive students concrete examples.\nThis reading is available below and as aPDF.\nIntroduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews | 193 Primary Research: Definitions and Overview\nHow research is defined varies widely from field to field, and as\nyou progress through your college career, your coursework will\nteach you much more about what it means to be a researcher\nwithin your field. For example, engineers, who focus on applying\nscientific knowledge to develop designs, processes, and objects,\nconduct research using simulations, mathematical models, and a\nvariety of tests to see how well their designs work. Sociologists\nconduct research using surveys, interviews, observations, and\nstatistical analysis to better understand people, societies, and\ncultures. Graphic designers conduct research through locating\nimagesforreferencefortheirartworkandengaginginbackground\nresearch on clients and companies to best serve their needs.\nHistorians conduct research by examining archival materials\u2014\nnewspapers, journals, letters, and other surviving texts\u2014and\nthroughconductingoralhistoryinterviews.Researchisnotlimited\ntowhathasalreadybeenwrittenorfoundatthelibrary,alsoknown\nassecondaryresearch.Rather,individualsconductingresearchare\nproducingthearticlesandreportsfoundinalibrarydatabaseorin\nabook.Primaryresearch,thefocusofthisessay,isresearchthatis\ncollectedfirsthandratherthanfoundinabook,database,orjournal.\nPrimaryresearchisoftenbasedonprinciplesofthescientific\nmethod,atheoryofinvestigationfirstdevelopedbyJohnStuartMill\nin the nineteenth century in his book Philosophy of the Scientific\nMethod. Although the application of the scientific method varies\nfrom field to field, the general principles of the scientific method\nallow researchers to learn more about the world and observable\nphenomena. Using the scientific method, researchers develop\nresearch questions or hypotheses and collect data on events,\nobjects, or people that is measurable, observable, and replicable.\nTheultimategoalinconductingprimaryresearchistolearnabout\nsomething new that can be confirmed by others and to eliminate\nour own biases in the process.\n194 | Introduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews Essay Overview and Student Examples\nTheessaybeginsbyprovidinganoverviewofethicalconsiderations\nwhenconductingprimaryresearch,andthencoversthestagesthat\nyou will go through in your primary research: planning, collecting,\nanalyzing,andwriting.Afterthefourstagescomesanintroduction\ntothreecommonwaysofconductingprimaryresearchinfirstyear\nwriting classes:\n\u2022 Observations.Observingandmeasuringtheworldaroundyou,\nincluding observations of people and other measurable events.\n\u2022 Interviews. Asking participants questions in a one-on-one or\nsmall group setting.\n\u2022 Surveys.Askingparticipantsabouttheiropinionsandbehaviors\nthrough a short questionnaire.\nIn addition, we will be examining two student projects that used\nsubstantial portions of primary research:\nDerek Laan, a nutrition major at Purdue University, wanted\nto learn more about student eating habits on campus. His primary\nresearchincludedobservationsofthecampusfoodcourts,student\nbehavior while in the food courts, and a survey of students\u2019 daily\nfood intake. His secondary research included looking at national\nstudent eating trends on college campuses, information from the\nUnitedStatesFoodandDrugAdministration,andbooksonhealthy\neating.\nJaredSchwab,anagriculturalandbiologicalengineeringmajor\nat Purdue, was interested in learning more about how writing and\ncommunication took place in his field. His primary research\nincluded interviewing a professional engineer and a student who\nwas a senior majoring in engineering. His secondary research\nincludedexaminingjournals,books,professionalorganizations,and\nwriting guides within the field of engineering.\nIntroduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews | 195 Ethics of Primary Research\nBoth projects listed above included primary research on human\nparticipants; therefore, Derek and Jared both had to consider\nresearchethicsthroughouttheirprimaryresearchprocess.AsEarl\nBabbie writes in The Practice of Social Research, throughout the\nearly and middle parts of the twentieth century researchers took\nadvantage of participants and treated them unethically. During\nWorld War II, Nazi doctors performed heinous experiments on\nprisoners without their consent, while in the U.S., a number of\nmedical and psychological experiments on caused patients undue\nmental and physical trauma and, in some cases, death. Because\nof these and other similar events, many nations have established\nethical laws and guidelines for researchers who work with human\nparticipants. In the United States, the guidelines for the ethical\ntreatment of human research participants are described in The\nBelmont Report, released in 1979. Today, universities have\nInstitutional Review Boards (or IRBs) that oversee research.\nStudents conducting research as part of a class may not need\npermission from the university\u2019s IRB, although they still need to\nensurethattheyfollowethicalguidelinesinresearch.Thefollowing\nprovides a brief overview of ethical considerations:\n\u2022 Voluntary participation. The Belmont Report suggests that, in\nmostcases,youneedtogetpermissionfrompeoplebeforeyou\ninvolve them in any primary research you are conducting. If\nyouaredoingasurveyorinterview,yourparticipantsmustfirst\nagree to fill out your survey or to be interviewed. Consent for\nobservationscanbemorecomplicated,andisdiscussedlaterin\nthe essay.\n\u2022 Confidentiality and anonymity. Your participants may reveal\nembarrassing or potentially damaging information such as\nracist comments or unconventional behavior. In these cases,\nyoushouldkeepyourparticipants\u2019identitiesanonymouswhen\n196 | Introduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews writing your results. An easy way to do this is to create a\n\u201cpseudonym\u201d (or false name) for them so that their identity is\nprotected.\n\u2022 Researcher bias. There is little point in collecting data and\nlearning about something if you already think you know the\nanswer!Biasmightbepresentinthewayyouaskquestions,the\nwayyoutakenotes,ortheconclusionsyoudrawfromthedata\nyou collect.\nTheaboveareonlythreeofmanyconsiderationswheninvolving\nhuman participants in your primary research. For a complete\nunderstandingofethicalconsiderationspleaserefertoTheBelmont\nReport.\nNow that we have considered the ethical implications of\nresearch,wewillexaminehowtoformulateresearchquestionsand\nplan your primary research project.\nPlanning Your Primary Research Project\nTheprimaryresearchprocessisquitesimilartothewritingprocess,\nand you can draw upon your knowledge of the writing process to\nunderstand the steps involved in a primary research project. Just\nlike in the writing process, a successful primary research project\nbeginswithcarefulplanningandbackgroundresearch.Thissection\nfirst describes how to create a research timeline to help plan your\nresearch. It then walks you through the planning stages by\nexaminingwhenprimaryresearchisusefulorappropriateforyour\nfirst year composition course, narrowing down a topic, and\ndeveloping research questions.\nIntroduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews | 197 The Research Timeline\nWhenyoubegintoconductanykindofprimaryresearch,creating\natimelinewillhelpkeepyouontask.Becausestudentsconducting\nprimaryresearchusuallyfocusonthecollectionofdataitself,they\noften overlook the equally important areas of planning (invention),\nanalyzingdata,andwriting.Tohelpmanageyourtime,youshould\ncreate a research timeline, such as the sample timeline presented\nhere.\nFig. 1: The Research Process\nFig. 2: A sample timeline of Jared\u2019s research project.\n198 | Introduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews When Primary Research Is Useful or Appropriate\nInEvaluatingScientificResearch:SeparatingFactfromFiction,Fred\nLeavitt explains that primary research is useful for questions that\ncanbeansweredthroughaskingothersanddirectobservation.For\nfirst year writing courses, primary research is particularly useful\nwhenyouwanttolearnaboutaproblemthatdoesnothaveawealth\nof published information.

For example, the\nquestion \u201cDoes an afterlife exist?\u201d is not a question that can be\nansweredwithprimaryresearch.However,thequestion\u201cHowmany\npeople in my community believe in an afterlife?\u201d is something that\nprimary research can answer.\nNarrowing Your Topic\nJustlikethewritingprocess,youshouldstartyourprimaryresearch\nprocesswithsecondary(library)researchtolearnmoreaboutwhat\nIntroduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews | 199 is already known and what gaps you need to fill with your own\ndata. As you learn more about the topic, you can narrow down\nyour interest area and eventually develop a research question or\nhypothesis, just as you would with a secondary research paper.\nDeveloping Research Questions or Hypotheses\nAs John Stuart Mill describes, primary research can use both\ninductive and deductive approaches, and the type approach is\nusually based on the field of inquiry. Some fields use deductive\nreasoning, where researchers start with a hypothesis or general\nconclusionandthencollectspecificdatatosupportorrefutetheir\nhypothesis.Otherfieldsuseinductivereasoning,whereresearchers\nstart with a question and collect information that eventually leads\nto a conclusion.\nOnceyouhavespentsometimereviewingthesecondaryresearch\nonyourtopic,youarereadytowriteaprimaryresearchquestionor\nhypothesis.Aresearchquestionorhypothesisshouldbesomething\nthatisspecific,narrow,anddiscoverablethroughprimaryresearch\nmethods. Just like a thesis statement for a paper, if your research\nquestionorhypothesisistoobroad,yourresearchwillbeunfocused\nandyourdatawillbedifficulttoanalyzeandwriteabout.Hereisa\nset of sample research questions:\nPoor Research Question: What do college students think of\npolitics and the economy?\nRevised Research Question: What do students at Purdue\nUniversity believe about the current economic crisis in\nterms of economic recoverability?\nThe poor research question is unspecific as to what group of\nstudentstheresearcherisinterestedin\u2014i.e.studentsintheU.S.?In\na particular state? At their university? The poor research question\nwas also too broad; terms like \u201cpolitics\u201d and the \u201ceconomy\u201d cover\n200 | Introduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews toomuchgroundforasingleproject.Therevisedquestionnarrows\ndown the topic to students at a particular university and focuses\nonaspecificissuerelatedtotheeconomy:economicrecoverability.\nThe research question could also be rephrased as a testable\nhypothesis using deductive reasoning: \u201cPurdue University college\nstudents are well informed about economic recoverability plans.\u201d\nBecause they were approaching their projects in an exploratory,\ninductive manner, both Derek and Jared chose to ask research\nquestions:\nDerek: Are students\u2019 eating habits at Purdue University\nhealthy or unhealthy? What are the causes of students\u2019\neating behavior?\nJared: What are the major features of writing and\ncommunication in agricultural and biological engineering?\nWhat are the major controversies?\nAfinalstepinworkingwitharesearchquestionorhypothesis\nis determining what key terms you are using and how you will\ndefine them. Before conducting his research, Derek had to define\nthe terms \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cunhealthy\u201d; for this, he used the USDA\u2019s\nFood Pyramid as a guide. Similarly, part of what Jared focused on\nin his interviews was learning more about how agricultural and\nbiological engineers defined terms like \u201cwriting\u201d and\n\u201ccommunication.\u201d Derek and Jared thought carefully about the\nterms within their research questions and how these terms might\nbe measured.\nChoosing a Data Collection Method\nOnce you have formulated a research question or hypothesis, you\nwillneedtomakedecisionsaboutwhatkindofdatayoucancollect\nthatwillbestaddressyourresearchtopic.Derekchosetoexamine\neating habits by observing both what students ate at lunch and\nsurveying students about eating behavior. Jared decided that in-\nIntroduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews | 201 depth interviews with experienced individuals in his field would\nprovide him with the best information.\nTochooseadatacollectionmethodforyourresearchquestion,\nread through the next sections on observations, interviews, and\nsurveys.\nObservations\nObservations have lead to some of the most important scientific\ndiscoveriesinhumanhistory.CharlesDarwinusedobservationsof\nthe animal and marine life at the Galapagos Islands to help him\nformulatehistheoryofevolutionthathedescribesinOntheOrigin\nof Species. Today, social scientists, natural scientists, engineers,\ncomputer scien- tists, educational researchers, and many others\nuse observations as a primary research method.\nObservationscanbeconductedonnearlyanysubjectmatter,\nandthekindsofobservationsyouwilldodependonyourresearch\nquestion.Youmightobservetrafficorparkingpatternsoncampus\nto get a sense of what improvements could be made. You might\nobserve clouds, plants, or other natural phenomena. If you choose\nto observe people, you will have several additional considerations\nincludingthemannerinwhichyouwillobservethemandgaintheir\nconsent.\nIf you are observing people, you can choose between two\ncommonwaystoobserve:participantobservationandunobtrusive\nobservation. Participant observation is a common method within\nethnographic research in sociology and anthropology. In this kind\nof observation, a researcher may interact with participants and\nbecome part of their community. Margaret Mead, a famous\nanthropologist, spent extended periods of time living in, and\ninteracting with, communities that she studied. Conversely, in\nunobtrusive observation, you do not interact with participants but\n202 | Introduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews rather simply record their behavior. Although in most\ncircumstances people must volunteer to be participants in re-\nsearch, in some cases it is acceptable to not let participants know\nyou are observing them. In places that people perceive as public,\nsuch as a campus food court or a shopping mall, people do not\nexpectprivacy,andsoitisgenerallyacceptabletoobservewithout\nparticipantconsent.Inplacesthatpeopleperceiveasprivate,which\ncan include a church, home, classroom, or even an intimate\nconversation at a restaurant, participant consent should be sought.\nThe second issue about participant consent in terms of\nunobtrusive observation is whether or not getting consent is\nfeasibleforthestudy.Ifyouareobservingpeopleinabusyairport,\nbusstation,orcampusfoodcourt,gettingparticipantconsentmay\nbe next to impossible. In Derek\u2019s study of student eating habits on\ncampus,hewenttothecampusfoodcourtsduringmealtimesand\nobserved students purchasing food. Obtaining participant consent\nfor his observations would have been next to impossible because\nhundreds of students were coming through the food court during\nmealtimes.SinceDerek\u2019sresearchwasinaplacethatparticipants\nwould perceive as public, it was not practical to get their consent,\nand since his data was anonymous, he did not violate their privacy.\nEliminating Bias in Your Observation Notes\nThe ethical concern of being unbiased is important in recording\nyourobservations.Youneedtobeawareofthedifferencebetween\nan observation (recording exactly what you see) and an\ninterpretation(makingassumptionsandjudgmentsaboutwhatyou\nsee). When you observe, you should focus first on only the events\nthat are directly observable. Consider the following two example\nentries in an observation log:\n1. The student sitting in the dining hall enjoys his greasy, oil-\nIntroduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews | 203 soaked pizza. He is clearly oblivious of the calorie content\nand damage it may do to his body.\n2. The student sits in the dining hall. As he eats his piece of\npizza, which drips oil, he says to a friend, \u201cThis pizza is\ngood.\u201d\nThe first entry is biased and demonstrates judgment about the\nevent. First, the observer makes assumptions about the internal\nstateofthestudentwhenshewrites\u201cenjoys\u201dand\u201cclearlyoblivious\nto the calorie content.\u201d From an observer\u2019s standpoint, there is no\nway of ascertaining what the student may or may not know about\npizza\u2019snutritionalvaluenorhowmuchthestudentenjoysthepizza.\nThe second entry provides only the details and facts that are\nobservable.\nToavoidbiasinyourobservations,youcanusesomethingcalled\na \u201cdouble-entry notebook.\u201d This is a type of observation log that\nencouragesyoutoseparateyourobservations(thefacts)fromyour\nfeelings and judgments about the facts.\nFig. 3: Two sample entries from a double-entry notebook\nObservations are only one strategy in collecting primary research.\nYou may also want to ask people directly about their behaviors,\nbeliefs, or attitudes\u2014and for this you will need to use surveys or\ninterviews.\n204 | Introduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews Surveys and Interviews: Question Creation\nSometimes it is very difficult for a researcher to gain all of the\nnecessary information through observations alone. Along with his\nobservations of the dining halls, Derek wanted to know what\nstudentsateinatypicalday,andsoheusedasurveytohavethem\nkeep track of their eating habits. Likewise, Jared wanted to learn\nabout writing and com- munication in engineering and decided\nto draw upon expert knowledge by asking experienced individuals\nwithin the field.\nInterviews and surveys are two ways that you can gather\ninformation about people\u2019s beliefs or behaviors. With these\nmethods, the in- formation you collect is not first-hand (like an\nobservation) but rather \u201cself-reported\u201d data, or data collected in\nan indirect manner. William Shadish, Thomas Cook, and Donald\nCampbellarguedthatpeopleareinherentlybiasedabouthowthey\nseetheworldandmayreporttheirownactionsinamorefavorable\nway than they may actually behave. Despite the issues in self-\nreporteddata,surveysandinterviewsareanexcellentwaytogather\ndata for your primary research project.\nSurvey or Interview?\nHowdoyouchoosebetweenconductingasurveyoraninterview?It\ndependsonwhatkindofinformationyouarelookingfor.Youshould\nuse surveys if you want to learn about a general trend in people\u2019s\nopinions,experiences,andbehavior.Surveysareparticularlyuseful\nto find small amounts of information from a wider selection of\npeople in the hopes of making a general claim. Interviews are best\nused when you want to learn detailed information from a few\nspecific people. Interviews are also particularly useful if you want\ntointerviewexpertsabouttheiropinions,asJareddid.Insum,use\nIntroduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews | 205 interviews to gain details from a few people, and surveys to learn\ngeneral patterns from many people.\nWriting Good Questions\nOneofthegreatestchallengesinconductingsurveysandinterviews\niswritinggoodquestions.Asaresearcher,youarealwaystryingto\neliminate bias, and the questions you ask need to be unbiased and\nclear. Here are some suggestions on writing good questions:\nAsk about One Thing at a Time\nA poorly written question can contain multiple questions, which\ncan confuse participants or lead them to answer only part of the\nquestionyouareasking.Thisiscalleda\u201cdouble-barreledquestion\u201d\nin journalism. The following questions are taken from Jared\u2019s\nresearch:\nPoorquestion:Whatkindsofproblemsarebeingfacedin\nthefieldtodayandwheredoyouseethesearchforsolutions\nto these problems going?\nRevised question #1 : What kinds of problems are being\nfaced in the field today?\nRevised question #2: Where do you see the search for\nsolu- tions to these problems going?\nAvoid Leading Questions\nA leading question is one where you prompt the participant to\nrespond in a particular way, which can create bias in the answers\ngiven:\n206 | Introduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews Leading question: The economy is clearly in a crisis,\nwouldn\u2019t you agree?\nRevisedquestion:Doyoubelievetheeconomyiscurrentlyin\na crisis? Why or why not?\nUnderstand When to Use Open and Closed Questions\nClosed questions, or questions that have yes\/no or other limited\nresponses, should be used in surveys. However, avoid these kinds\nofquestionsininterviewsbecausetheydiscouragetheinterviewee\nfromgoingintodepth.Thequestionsampleabove,\u201cDoyoubelieve\nthe economy currently is in a crisis?\u201d could be answered with a\nsimpleyesorno,whichcouldkeepaparticipantfromtalkingmore\nabout the issue.

This section presents\ninformation on how to conduct a successful interview, including\nchoosing the right person, ways of interviewing, recording your\ninterview, interview locations, and transcribing your interview.\nChoosing the Right Person\nOne of the keys to a successful interview is choosing the right\npersontointerview.Thinkaboutwhomyouwouldliketointerview\nand whom you might know. Do not be afraid to ask people you do\nnot know for interviews. When asking, simply tell them what the\ninterview will be about, what the interview is for, and how much\ntime it will take. Jared used his Purdue University connection to\nlocate both of the individuals that he ended up interviewing\u2014an\nadvanced Purdue student and a Purdue alum working in an\nEngineering firm.\nFace-to-Face and Virtual Interviews\nWhen interviewing, you have a choice of conducting a traditional,\nface-to-face interview or an interview using technology over the\nInternet. Face-to-face interviews have the strength that you can\naskfollow-upquestionsandusenon-verbalcommunicationtoyour\nadvantage.Individualsareabletosaymuchmoreinaface-to-face\ninterview than in an email, so you will get more information from\na face-to-face interview. However, the Internet provides a host of\nnewpossibilitieswhenitcomestointerviewingpeopleatadistance.\n208 | Introduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews Youmaychoosetodoanemailinterview,whereyousendquestions\nandaskthepersontorespond.Youmayalsochoosetouseavideo\nor audio conferencing program to talk with the person virtually. If\nyouarechoosinganyInternet-basedoption,makesureyouhavea\nway of recording the interview. You may also use a chat or instant\nmessaging program to interview your participant\u2014the benefit of\nthis is that you can ask follow-up questions during the interview\nandtheinterviewisalreadytranscribedforyou.Becauseoneofhis\nintervieweeslivedseveralhoursaway,Jaredchosetointerviewthe\nPurdue student face- to-face and the Purdue alum via email.\nFinding a Suitable Location\nIfyouareconductinganin-personinterview,itisessentialthatyou\nfind a quiet place for your interview. Many universities have quiet\nstudy rooms that can be reserved (often found in the university\nlibrary). Do not try to interview someone in a coffee shop, dining\nhall, or other loud area, as it is difficult to focus and get a clear\nrecording.\nRecording Interviews\nOne way of eliminating bias in your research is to record your\ninterviews rather than rely on your memory. Recording interviews\nallowsyoutodirectlyquotetheindividualandre-readtheinterview\nwhen you are writing. It is recommended that you have two\nrecording devices for the interview in case one recording device\nfails. Most computers, MP3 players, and even cell phones come\nwith recording equipment built in. Many universities also offer\nequipment that students can check out and use, including\nIntroduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews | 209 computersandrecorders.Beforeyourecordanyinterview,besure\nthat you have permission from your participant.\nTranscribing Your Interview\nOnce your interview is over, you will need to transcribe your\ninterview to prepare it for analysis. The term transcribing means\ncreatingawrit-tenrecordthatisexactlywhatwassaid\u2014i.e.typing\nup your interviews. If you have conducted an email or chat\ninterview,youalreadyhaveatranscriptionandcanmoveontoyour\nanalysis stage.\nSurveys\nOtherthanthefactthattheybothinvolveaskingpeoplequestions,\ninterviewsandsurveysarequitedifferentdatacollectionmethods.\nCreating a survey may seem easy at first, but developing a quality\nsurvey can be quite challenging. When conducting a survey, you\nneedtofocusonthefollowingareas:surveycreation,surveytesting,\nsurvey sampling, and distributing your survey.\nSurvey Creation: Length and Types of Questions\nOne of the keys to creating a successful survey is to keep your\nsurvey short and focused. Participants are unlikely to fill out a\nsurvey that is lengthy, and you\u2019ll have a more difficult time during\nyour analysis if your survey contains too many questions. In most\ncases,youwantyoursurveytobesomethingthatcanbefilledout\nwithinafewminutes.Thetargetlengthofthesurveyalsodepends\n210 | Introduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews onhowyouwilldistributethesurvey.Ifyouaregivingyoursurvey\ntootherstudentsinyourdormorclasses,theywillhavemoretime\ntocompletethesurvey.Therefore,fivetotenminutestocomplete\nthe survey is reasonable. If you are asking students as they are\nwalking to class to fill out your sur- vey, keep it limited to several\nquestions that can be answered in thirty seconds or less. Derek\u2019s\nsurveytookabouttenminutesandaskedstudentstodescribewhat\nthey ate for a day, along with some demographic information like\nclass level and gender.\nUse closed questions to your advantage when creating your\nsurvey.Aclosedquestionisanysetofquestionsthatgivesalimited\namount of choices (yes\/no, a 1\u20135 scale, choose the statement that\nbest describes you). When creating closed questions, be sure that\nyou are accounting for all reasonable answers in your question\ncreation. For example, ask- ing someone \u201cDo you believe you eat\nhealthy?\u201d and providing them only \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d options means\nthat a \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cundecided\u201d option does not exist, even though\nthesurveyrespondentmaynotfeelstronglyeitherway.Therefore,\non closed questions you may find it helpful to include an \u201cother\u201d\ncategory where participants can fill in an answer. It is also a good\nidea to have a few open-ended questions where participants can\nelaborate on certain points or earlier responses. However, open-\nended questions take much longer to fill out than closed questions.\nSurvey Creation: Testing Your Survey\nTo make sure your survey is an appropriate length and that your\nquestions are clear, you can \u201cpilot test\u201d your survey. Prior to\nadministeringyoursurveyonalargerscale,askseveralclassmates\nor friends to fill it out and give you feedback on the survey. Keep\ntrack of how long the survey takes to complete. Ask them if the\nquestionsareclearandmakesense.Lookattheiranswerstoseeif\nIntroduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews | 211 the answers match what you wanted to learn. You can revise your\nsurvey questions and the length of your survey as necessary.\nSampling and Access to Survey Populations\n\u201cSampling\u201d is a term used within survey research to describe the\nsubset of people that are included in your study. Derek\u2019s first\nresearch question was: \u201cAre students\u2019 eating habits at Purdue\nUniversity healthy or unhealthy?\u201d Because it was impossible for\nDerektosurveyall38,000studentsonPurdue\u2019scampus,hehadto\nchoosearepresentativesampleofstudents.Derekchosetosurvey\nstudents who lived in the dorms because of the wide variety of\nstudent class levels and majors in the dorms and his easy access\nto this group. By making this choice, however, he did not account\nfor commuter students, graduate students, or those who live off\ncampus.AsDerek\u2019scasedemonstrates,itisverychallengingtoget\na truly representative sample.\nPart of the reason that sampling is a challenge is that you\nmayfinddifficultyinfindingenoughpeopletotakeyoursurvey.In\nthinking about how get people to take your survey, consider both\nyoureverydaysurroundingsandalsotechnologicalsolutions.Derek\nhad access to many students in the dorms, but he also considered\nsurveyingstudentsinhisclassesinordertoreachasmanypeopleas\npossible.Anotherpossibilityistoconductanonlinesurvey.Online\nsurveys greatly increase your access to different kinds of people\nfrom across the globe, but may decrease your chances of having\na high survey response rate. An email or private message survey\nrequest is more likely to be ignored due to the impersonal quality\nand high volume of emails most people receive.\n212 | Introduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews Analyzing and Writing About Primary Research\nOnce you collect primary research data, you will need to analyze\nwhat you have found so that you can write about it. The purpose\nof analyzing your data is to look at what you collected (survey\nresponses, interview answers to questions, observations) and to\ncreate a cohesive, systematic interpretation to help answer your\nresearch question or ex- amine the validity of your hypothesis.\nWhen you are analyzing and presenting your findings,\nremember to work to eliminate bias by being truthful and as\naccurate as possible about what you found, even if it differs from\nwhat you expected to find. You should see your data as sources of\ninformation,justlikesourcesyoufindinthelibrary,andyoushould\nwork to represent them accurately.\nThe following are suggestions for analyzing different types of\ndata.\nObservations\nIfyou\u2019vecountedanythingyouwereobserving,youcansimplyadd\nup what you counted and report the results. If you\u2019ve collected\ndescriptions using a double-entry notebook, you might work to\nwrite thick descriptions of what you observed into your writing.\nThis could include descriptions of the scene, behaviors you\nobserved, and your overall conclusions about events. Be sure that\nyourreadersareclearonwhatwereyouractualobservationsversus\nyour thoughts or interpretations of those observations.\nInterviews\nIf you\u2019ve interviewed one or two people, then you can use your\nIntroduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews | 213 summary,paraphrasing,andquotationskillstohelpyouaccurately\ndescribe what was said in the interview. Just like in secondary\nresearch when working with sources, you should introduce your\ninterviewees and choose clear and relevant quotes from the\ninterviewstouseinyourwriting.Aneasywaytofindtheimportant\ninformation in an interview is to print out your transcription and\ntakeahighlighterandmarktheimportantpartsthatyoumightuse\ninyourpaper.Ifyouhaveconductedalargenumberofinterviews,\nit will be helpful for you to create a spreadsheet of responses to\neachquestionandcomparetheresponses,choosingrepresentative\nanswers for each area you want to describe.\nSurveys\nSurveys can contain quantitative (numerical) and qualitative\n(written answers\/descriptions) data. Quantitative data can be\nanalyzed using a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel to\ncalculatethemean(average)answerortocalculatethepercentage\nof people who responded in a certain way. You can display this\ninformation in a chart or a graph and also describe it in writing in\nyour paper. If you have qualitative responses, you might choose to\ngroupthemintocategoriesand\/oryoumaychoosetoquoteseveral\nrepresentative responses.\nWriting about Primary Research\nIn formal research writing in a variety of fields, it is common for\nresearch to be presented in the following format: introduction\/\nbackground;methods;results;discussions;conclusion.Notallfirst\nyear writing classes will require such an organizational structure,\nalthough it is likely that you will be required to present many of\n214 | Introduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews these elements in your paper. Because of this, the next section\nexamines each of these in depth.\nIntroduction (Review of Literature)\nThe purpose of an introduction and review of literature in a\nresearch paper is to provide readers with information that helps\nthem understand the context, purpose, and relevancy of your\nresearch. The introduction is where you provide most of your\nbackground (library) research that you did earlier in the process.\nYou can include articles, statistics, research studies, and quotes\nthat are pertinent to the issues at hand. A second purpose in an\nintroduction is to establish your own credibility (ethos) as a writer\nby showing that you have researched your topic thoroughly. This\nkind of background discussion is required in nearly every field of\ninquiry when presenting research in oral or writ- ten formats.\nDerek provided information from the Food and Drug\nAdministrationonhealthyeatingandnationalstatisticsabouteating\nhabitsaspartofhisbackgroundinformation.Healsomadethecase\nfor healthy eating on campus to show relevancy:\nCurrentlyAmericansaremoreoverweightthanever.This\niscomingatahugecosttotheeconomyandgovernment.If\ncurrenttrendsinincreasingratesofoverweightandobesity\ncontinueitislikelythatthisgenerationwillbethefirstone\nto live shorter lives than their parents did.

Primary research techniques show up in more places than\njust first year writing courses. Where else might\ninterviews, surveys, or observations be used? Where have\nyou seen them used?\n2. The chapter provides a brief discussion of the ethical\nconsiderations of research. Can you think of any additional\nethical considerations when conducting primary research?\nIntroduction to Primary Research: Observations, Surveys, and\nInterviews | 219 Can you think of ethical considerations unique to your\nown research project?\n3. Primary research is most useful for first year writing\nstudents if it is based in your local community or campus.\nWhat are some current issues on your campus or in your\ncommunity that could be investigated using primary\nresearch methods?\n4. In groups or as a class, make a list of potential primary\nresearch topics. After each topic on the list, consider what\nmethod of inquiry (observation, interview, or survey) you\nwould use to study the topic and answer why that method\nis a good choice.\nSuggested Resources\nFor more information on the primary methods of inquiry\ndescribed here, please see the following sources:\nBabbie, Earl.

Ethnography\n(fromtheGreekethno-,meaning\u201cpeople\u201dand\u2013grapho,meaning\u201cto\nwrite\u201d) is a common research methodology, a way of thinking and\ndoing that includes many kinds of methods put together as data\nin the humanities and social sciences. It uses a variety of research\npractices that work with people in order to come to some kind of\nconclusion about a societal or cultural phenomenon.

A survey is a series of carefully-designed\nquestions, sometimes called a questionnaire. In the context of a\nWorking With People | 231 research project, surveys are put together with the intention of\ngathering information that will answer a bigger research question.\nWhether working with smaller or larger populations of people,\nsurveys can help you determine both countable, or quantitative,\ninformation about your respondents (how many people answered\nyes or no on a question, for example) and descriptive information,\nor qualitative data, about their opinions, habits, and beliefs\u2014what\nwemightcallvariables.*Inthefollowingexamples,wediscusshow\na researcher might go about research design and considerations\nwhen working with small and large groups as well as with one or\nmorevariables.However,whenitcomestosurveyquestiondesign\nand survey implementation (getting your surveys out to intended\nrespondents),thereareresourcesthatyoucanaccessthatwillhelp\nno matter how large or small a population you study.\n*The word \u201cvariables\u201d is also used to describe\nquantitative data. Much like qualitative variables,\nvariables in those cases are items that you can measure,\nsuch as time, height, density, distance, strength, and\nweight. Such variables are usually those that come with\nmeasurement markers\u2014pounds, inches, centimeters,\nmicrons, moles.\nExample 1: You get your most recent paper back from your\ninstructor, and on it you\u2019ve received a B+.

You can search them by keyword and find surveys on\ntopics done that are similar to the one you\u2019re planning.\nOnce you have a few models of survey questions, you can\n236 | Working With People change them to suit your needs. There are a few best practices to\nkeep in mind when designing your own questionnaire:\n\u2022 Don\u2019t forget instructions! Be sure to tell people briefly what\nthey can expect (how many questions, how to fill out the\nsurvey, and how long it will take to complete).\n\u2022 Questions should be clear and free of jargon: don\u2019t put in any\nspecialized vocabulary that would be difficult for a respondent\nto understand.\n\u2022 If you have to use technical terms, define them for your\nrespondents.\n\u2022 Each question should measure only one thing at a time\u2014avoid\nquestions that ask people to respond to multiple items in one\nquestion.\n\u2022 If you are putting answers on a scale, respondents should have\nbetween five and seven points from which to choose.\n\u2022 Be as specific as you can with your questions, whether they are\nopen- or closed-ended.\n\u2022 Questions should be short. In fact, your questionnaire should\nbe short! When questions and surveys are too long, people lose\ninterest and do not complete them.\n\u2022 With closed-ended questions, people often choose the first\noption they read (if reading a survey) and the last option they\nhear (if a survey is read aloud). Vary the order of your answers\nto avoid this, if you can.\n\u2022 Try to avoid loaded (or unloaded!) language that might\npersuadeyour respondents to answer a certain way: there is a\nperceived difference between, for example, the words \u201cclimate\nchange\u201d and \u201cglobal warming.\u201d Be sure you use the terminology\nyou mean, and be ready to explain your choices in your\nanalysis.\nWorking With People | 237 Designing and Distributing Surveys\nSurveys can be physically designed and distributed in a number\nof ways: on paper through the mail, in person, on the phone, or\nonlinethroughemailoradistributedlink.It\u2019simportanttonotethat\nif you deliver a survey in person (on the phone or distributing a\npaper survey), you should have an introductory script that gives a\nframework and instructions for your research.\nIf you are designing and\/or distributing a survey online, you\ncan use websites that offer free survey software with some basic\nfunctionality\u2014surveys of ten questions or less, say, or surveys that\nmaxoutatatotalnumberofrespondents.*Theseareexcellentand\nprofessional sites to use to begin your survey research, and the\nsurveys you produce with them can be circulated and embedded\ninto emails to specific people or circulated as a link that can be\nforwardedontootherpeoplethanitsfirstrecipients.Ifyourequire\nmore functionality, you might check with your college or\nuniversity\u2019s research office, some of which give access to\ninstitutional survey software to students upon request.

Yet interviews\nalso generate a lot of data because conversations need to be\nrecorded and usually transcribed or written down (and it takes\nabout three hours to transcribe every one hour of talk). A benefit\nto interviews is that there are different types, depending on your\nresearchquestion.Youmightsitdownwithasmallgroupofpeople,\ncalled a focus group, and ask one question to see how people\nWorking With People | 239 respond and negotiate their answers in groups, since usually one\nperson\u2019s response provokes agreement, disagreement, or room for\nfollow-up. A focus group might enable you to get a general sense\nof consensus or understand divergent attitudes about a particular\nvariable. You might develop questions for 1-on-1 research\ninterviews, in which you sit down with one person at a time and\nask them a series of carefully-designed questions that help you\nanswer your research question (you might repeat the same set of\nquestionswitheachinterviewforconsistency,inthiscase).Ifyour\npurposes extend beyond only answering a research question and\nyouaretryingtopreserveasoundrecordingofstoriesormemories\nforfuturegenerationstolistento,thenyouwouldconductanoral\nhistory interview with either one person or a group of people,\nin which you would design an interview script with topics about\na particular area of interest and a long list of questions that you\nmay or may not ask, depending on your participant\u2019s memory and\nwillingness to talk.

They\nshouldn\u2019t try to double up a few questions in just one breath or\nbe written in a way that offends a listener or presumes something\nabout them.

(Note that\nChapter 1 introduces research questions and the ways they\nexpand and shift throughout a research process.) Once you\nhave that, you\u2019ll need to figure out what exactly it is you\u2019re\nhoping to learn to be able to answer that research question.\nThen, you\u2019ll need to determine who you might ask to get at\nWorking With People | 241 what you want to learn. Finally, you\u2019ll generate a list of\ninterview questions that would help you get at what you\u2019re\ntrying to learn\u2014from the side! Here\u2019s an example of how\nthis process works:\n\u2022 Research Question: What matters more in the\nworkplace: \u201chard skills\u201d (technical skills) or \u201csoft skills\u201d\n(communication skills)?\n\u2022 What I\u2019m hoping to learn: Do employers value\ntechnical skills more than communication skills or\nvice-versa? Are college or university graduates being\ngiven the tools they need in technical and\ncommunication skills to get a job when they\ngraduate? Which kind of skill is the more difficult to\nlearn?\n\u2022 Who might have this information: Employers\/\nemployees at any company, recently employed\ncollege or university graduates, instructors in both\ntechnical and communication-based fields are all\nlikely to have insights.\n\u2022 Interview questions from the side that will help\nme learn what I want to know:\n\u25e6 For an employer: What is the most important\nskill an employee can have?\n\u25e6 For a student: What is the hardest\nassignment you ever had to complete? What\nmade it so hard?\n\u25e6 For anyone: Think about a recent problem\nthat came up in your workplace. What do you\nthink caused it?\n242 | Working With People Based on this example, come up with some interview\nquestions from the side for your own research question.\nInterviewing Equipment and Best Practices\nUnlike surveys, to really be useful, interviews need to be audio-\nor video-recorded and then transcribed so you can understand\nwhat was said in order to interpret your data.

Because they\nemphasize storytelling, ways of seeing the self or the\ncommunity, and memories of historical events, oral history\ninterviews often need fewer specific questions and more\nprompts than research interviews.\nFirst, choose one of the following topics:\nWorking With People | 245 \u2022 Changes in telephone technology since its patent in\n1876\n\u2022 The best cake you\u2019ve ever eaten\n\u2022 The \u201cmillenium\u201d or \u201cY2K\u201d bug\n\u2022 The development of a local community center in\nyour region\n\u2022 The increase in diabetes since 1980\n\u2022 The price of gasoline over the last 100 years\nThen, generate with a partner four different interview\nquestions (one of which needs to be a follow-up question)\nfor both a research interview and an oral history interview.\nWhen you\u2019re finished, discuss the differences between the\ntwo sets of questions and what accounts for these\ndifferences.\nWhenyou\u2019reinterviewing,it\u2019simportanttokeeptrackofyourmain\nresearch question, as responses may stray from what you expect\nand you might get caught up in what your interviewee is saying.\nIt\u2019s important to be prepared with follow-up interview questions\nthat might piggy-back off of a prior question. Similarly, you might\nalso want to be prepared to ask \u201cWhy?\u201d or \u201cTell me more about\nthat,\u201d after an answer you receive (especially if you get an answer\nthat is shorter than you expect). Sometimes the best questions\nsimply ask for clarification (\u201cCould you tell me what you mean by\nthat?\u201d or \u201cCould you give me an example of what you mean?\u201d) or\nare constructed on the fly (\u201cCan we go back to that example you\ntalkedaboutearlier?\u201dor\u201cHowdidyoufeelaboutthat?\u201d).Oralhistory\ninterviews benefit from mocking up an outline of topics and then\ngeneratingalistofmanypossiblequestionsineachsectionofyour\noutlineandlettingtheintervieworganicallyemergefromwhatever\nseries of questions are appropriate.\nFinally, it is important to take into account that, as the\n246 | Working With People interviewer, you develop and ask the questions.

The\nchapter focuses on the possibilities of using archives,\nconducting site-based observations, and making maps to\nbetter understand subjects and rhetorical situations. These\nfieldwork methods give researchers new ways of answering\ntheir research questions by collecting and curating\nartifacts, and in uncovering the relationships between\nphysical locations, materials, data, and language.\nThis reading is available below and as aPDF.\nSo far in this book, we\u2019ve been paying close attention to words\nand how to do things that are ethical, meaningful, and methodical\nwith them.

Researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds use\ntheprocessofmakingusingthingsasavitalpartoftheirresearch\nmethods. Take, for example, the way that making a textile, like a\nbasket or a quilt, helps give our bodies a particular kind of touch\nknowledge. When we engage in sharing that basket or quilt with\nothers and observe their reactions to our ef- forts, that gives us\na certain kind of affective, embodied, or feeling-knowledge.

Find one artifact\nin the archive (image, text, audio, video) and answer the following\nquestions about it:\nWorking With Places and Things | 261 \u2022 What kind of artifact is it? Who authored it and for what\npurpose?\n\u2022 What does the kind of artifact it is tell you about what it\ncontains? How does the artifact type (for example, interview\ntranscript, photograph, or meeting note) give you clues as to\nwhat it can contain and what it cannot?\n\u2022 Why was the artifact created and by whom was it made?\nWhat function did\/does it serve?\n\u2022 Who was the intended audience for the artifact? Do you\nthink the creator ever intended you to be viewing the\nartifact?\n\u2022 When was the artifact created? What was going on in the\nworld then that could have affected its creation?\n\u2022 Where was the artifact created? Did it have to travel to be\nincluded in the archive? What does that tell you about the\nartifact?\n\u2022 What clues from the artifact (words, formality or\ninformality of tone or dress, position of landmarks or\ncommonplaces) help you understand where it comes from?\n\u2022 Is the artifact unique, or is it one of a series of other\nartifacts like it? How do you know?\n\u2022 How reliable is the artifact? How do you know? How would\nyou cite this artifact?\n\u2022 Who is missing from the artifact, and what might that tell\nyou about the time or place it was made?\n\u2022 What is your own reaction to the artifact?

How might subsequent researchers take up\nSanchez\u2019s findings?\n\u2022 Heidi McKee described how in 2008 she read a research\nproject that accidentally included contact information for one\nof the research participants who was supposed to be\nanonymous. The authors had included a screen capture of a\nnewspaper article that described the research participant\u2019s\nbrush with the law. Although the researchers meant to keep\nthe subject\u2019s identity secret, the screen capture was easily\nenlarged, and the article and identifying information about the\nperson was easily accessed. How does this experience\nhighlight the complexities of maintaining research participant\nanonymity? How does digital research and publication impact\nthis complexity?\n\u2022 Photographer Christine Rogers developed a series of images\nbetween 2007-2008 titled \u201cNew Family\u201d in which she posed for\nfamily photos (complete with the quintessential hand on\nshoulder pose) with people who were strangers to her.

Bad Idea About Writing:\n\"You Can Learn to Write in\nGeneral\"\nELIZABETH WARDLE\nAbstract\nAlthough the purpose of a first-year writing class is\nostensibly to teach you how to write in college, there is no\nway to teach anyone to write in all situations. Instead, a\nfirst-year writing course asks faculty and students to\nunderstand writing situations and the best way to approach\ndifferent situations. This is the argument of Elizabeth\nWardle\u2019s essay fromBad Ideas About Writing, \u201cYou Can\nLearn to Write in General.\u201d\nThis reading is available below, as aPDF, or as apodcast.\nThere is no such thing as writing in general.

Do not write for any specific audience,\npurpose,orcontext.Donotuseanyconventionsthatyou\u2019velearned\nfor school, work, creative writing, and so on. Just write in general.\nYou can\u2019t do it, because it can\u2019t be done. There is no such thing\nas writing in general. Writing is always in particular. It\u2019s not just\ncommon sense that tells us that learning to write in general is not\n| 289 possible.Manystudiesofwritinghavebeendone\u2014inworkplaces,in\nclassesacrossthecollegelandscape,andinsocialandcivicsettings.\nThey tell us that every new situation, audience, and purpose\nrequireswriterstolearntodoandunderstandnewpossibilitiesand\nconstraintsfortheirwriting.WritingfanfictioninWattpadrequires\nunderstandingwhatotherfansexpect,whatfanfictionwritersand\nreaders think good fan fiction is, and what the technological\nmediumsupportsandallows.Thesameistrueforanyotherkindof\nwriting\u2014we write in our journals and think of our future selves or\nanyonewhomightfindthejournal.Wewriteasbiologistsforother\nspecialistswhounderstandpreviousfindingsandvaluetheideasof\nsome biologists more than others. As students write across their\ngeneral education courses, they find themselves repeatedly asked\nto write essays or research papers, but often learn the hard way\nthat their history teacher, poetry teacher, and philosophy teacher\nall mean and expect very different things by \u201cessay\u201d or \u201cresearch\npaper.\u201dThisisbecausecontext,audience,purpose,medium,history,\nandvaluesofthecommunityallimpactwhatwritingisandneedsto\nbe in each situation.\nThere is no writing in general, and thus no single class or\nworkshop or experience can teach people to write. once and for\nall. But people want to believe that it\u2019s possible to write in general\nbecausethisbeliefmakeswritingseemlessdifficultandallowsthem\nto believe that writers can get a one-time writing inoculation that\nwill extend across all settings.

This\nmeans that when an employer hires a student fresh out of college\nand asks her to write a report for the CEO, he might expect that\nshe knows what a report is in general, but he needs to remember\nthat she\u2019s never seen a report at this company (she needs some\nexamples),doesnotknowtheCEOandhisidiosyncrasies(sheneeds\nsomeinsiderinfo),anddoesnotyetunderstandwhatpeopleinthis\nsettingconsiderimportant(sheneedsaheads-uponthat).Similarly,\nparentsshouldexpectthattheirchildmightstrugglewhenwriting\ninanewclass,orwhenmovingfromhighschooltocollegebecause\nlearning takes time and requires being immersed in the context.\nJournalists and critics need to remember that texting employs\ncertain conventions that are appropriate for their medium and\npurpose\u2014and those are not destroying writing in general, because\nthereisnowritingingeneral.Allofus,then,shouldgiveourselves\ntime to anticipate new writing situations, look at examples, find\nout what people\u2019s values and expectations are in them, and give\nourselvestimetopracticeandlearnwhatweneedtoknowinorder\nto write successfully in that new situation.\nIf we can remember that there is no writing in general and no\nmagic formula that will help us write well in all situations, we are\nmore likely to be able to use (or transfer or repurpose) what we\nknow effectively from prior writing situations.

Navigating Genres\nKERRY DIRK\nAbstract\nIn this chapter fromWriting Spaces: Readings on Writing,\nVolume 1, Kerry Dirk introduces students to genres as\nrhetorical responses to reoccurring or similar situations.\nAfter defining genre in the context of rhetoric and\ncomposition scholarship, she uses examples from popular\nculture, discussion from contemporary scholars, and\npersonal experience to show students how genre\nawareness requires a rhetorical way of looking at writing.\nThis chapter is meant not to teach students how to write in\nany one particular genre; rather, it is meant to help\nstudents start to see their own writing endeavors as texts\nthat function within the context of genres.\nThis reading is available below or as aPDF.\nThere\u2019sajokethat\u2019sbeenfloatingaroundsometimenowthatyou\u2019ve\n1\nlikely already heard.

I think that using such references can help\nyou to see, in a quite concrete way, how genres function.\nWhen I started writing this essay, I had some ideas of what I\nwanted to say. But first, I had to determine what this essay might\nlook like. I\u2019ve written a lot\u2014letters, nonfiction pieces, scholarly\narticles, rants\u2014but this was my first time writing an essay to you,\na composition student. What features, I asked myself, should go\ninto this essay? How personal could I get? What rhetorical moves\nmight I use, effectively or ineffectively? I hoped that a similar type\nof essay already existed so that I would have something to guide\nmy own writing. I knew I was looking for other essays written\ndirectly to students, and after finding many examples, I looked for\ncommon features. In particular, I noted the warm, personal style\nthat was prevalent through every essay; the tone was primarily\nconversational.Andmoreimportantly,Inoticedthatthewriterdid\nnot talk as an authoritative figure but as a coach. Some writers\nadmitted that they did not know everything (we don\u2019t), and others\neven went so far as to admit ignorance.

Carolyn Miller, a leading professor\ninthefieldoftechnicalcommunication,arguesthat\u201carhetorically\nsound definition of genre must be centered . . . on the action it\nis used to accomplish\u201d (151).

When\napproaching a genre for a the first time, you likely view it as more\nthan a simple form: \u201cPicking up a text, readers not only classify\nit and expect a certain form, but also make assumptions about\nthe text\u2019s purposes, its subject matter, its writer, and its expected\nreader\u201d (Devitt, Writing 12).

Why am I picking popular genres to\ndiscuss? I think I agree with Miller when she argues the following:\nTo consider as potential genres such homely discourse as\ntheletterofrecommendation,theusermanual,theprogress\nreport, the ransom note, the lecture, and the white paper,\naswellastheeulogy,theapologia,theinaugural,thepublic\nproceeding, and the sermon, is not to trivialize the study\nof genres; it is to take seriously the rhetoric in which we\nareimmersedandthesituationsinwhichwefindourselves.\n(155)\nInotherwords,Millerissayingthatallgenresmatterbecausethey\nshape our everyday lives.

Why? I think the success lies in the\nfact that the writers of these headlines are rhetorically aware of\nwhom these headlines are directed toward\u2014college students like\nyou, and more specifically, educated college students who know\nenough about politics, culture, and U.S. and world events to \u201cget\u201d\nthese headlines.\nAndnowforsomebadnews:figuringoutagenreistrickyalready,\nbut this process is further complicated by the fact that two texts\nthat might fit into the same genre might also look extremely\nNavigating Genres | 301 different. But let\u2019s think about why this might be the case. Devitt\npointsout,\u201cdifferentgrocerystoresmakefordifferentgrocerylists.\nDifferent law courts make for different legal briefs. And different\ncollege classes make for different research papers. Location may\nnot be the first, second, and third most important qualities of\nwriting, as it is for real estate, but location is surely among the\nsituational elements that lead to expected genres and to\nadaptations of those genres in particular situations\u201d\n(\u201cTransferability\u201d 218). Think about a time when you were asked\nto write a research paper. You probably had an idea of what that\npapershouldlooklike,butyoualsoneededtoconsiderthelocation\nof the assignment. In other words, you needed to consider how\nyour particular teacher\u2019s expectations would help to shape your\nassignment. This makes knowing a genre about much more than\nsimply knowing its form.

These rules are appealing; they tell us exactly\nwhattodoandnottodowithregardtowriting.Irememberhappily\ncreating introductions that moved from broad to specific (often\nstarting with \u201cIn our world\u201d), constructing three point thesis\nstatements, and beginning paragraphs with \u201cfirst,\u201d \u201csecond,\u201d and\n\u201cthird.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to think about audience, or purpose, or even\nmuch about content for that matter.

Understanding Discourse\nCommunities\nDAN MELZER\nAbstract\nThis chapter fromWriting Spaces: Readings About\nWriting, Volume 3explains why the concept ofdiscourse\ncommunitiesis so important for college writing and\nbeyond. Dan Melzer explains how genres operate within\ndiscourse communities, why different discourse\ncommunities have different expectations for writing, and\nhow to understand what qualifies as a discourse\ncommunity. The article relates the concept of discourse\ncommunity to a personal example from the author (an\nacoustic guitar jam group) and an example of the academic\ndiscipline of history. The article takes a critical stance\nregarding the concept of discourse community, discussing\nboth the benefits and constraints of communicating within\ndiscourse communities. The article concludes with writerly\nquestions students can ask themselves as they enter new\ndiscourse communities in order to be more effective\ncommunicators.\nThe reading is available below or as aPDF. The PDF\nincludes additional teacher resources.\n310 | Understanding Discourse Communities Last year, I decided that if I was ever going to achieve my lifelong\nfantasy of being the first college writing teacher to transform into\naninternationalrockstar,Ishouldprobablygraduatefromplaying\n1\nthe video game Guitar Hero to actually learning to play guitar. I\nbought an acoustic guitar and started watching every beginning\nguitar instructional video on YouTube. At first, the vocabulary the\nonline guitar teachers used was like a foreign language to\nme\u2014terms like major and minor chords, open G tuning, and circle\nof fifths.

But most writers,\n312 | Understanding Discourse Communities like most musicians, learn their craft from studying experts and\nbecoming part of a community. And most writers, like most\nmusicians,wanttobeapartofcommunityandcommunicatewith\notherpeoplewhosharetheirgoalsandinterests.Writingteachers\nand scholars have come up with the concept of \u201cdiscourse\ncommunity\u201dtodescribeacommunityofpeoplewhosharethesame\ngoals, the same methods of communicating, the same genres, and\nthe same lexis (specialized language).\nWhat Exactly Is a Discourse Community?\nJohn Swales, a scholar in linguistics, says that discourse\ncommunities have the following features (which I\u2019m paraphrasing):\n1. A broadly agreed upon set of common public goals\n2. Mechanisms of intercommunication among members\n3. Use of these communication mechanisms to provide\ninformation and feedback\n4. One or more genres that help further the goals of the\ndiscourse community\n5. A specific lexis (specialized language)\n6. A threshold level of expert members (24-26)\nI\u2019ll use my example of the monthly guitar jam group I joined to\nexplain these six aspects of a discourse community.\nA Broadly Agreed Set of Common Public Goals\nThe guitar jam group had shared goals that we all agreed on. In\ntheMeetup.comdescriptionofthesite,theorganizerofthegroup\nemphasized that these monthly gatherings were for having fun,\nenjoying the music, and learning new songs. \u201cGuitar players\u201d or\n\u201cpeople who like music\u201d or even \u201cguitarists in Sacramento,\nCalifornia\u201d are not discourse communities. They don\u2019t share the\nUnderstanding Discourse Communities | 313 samegoals,andtheydon\u2019tallinteractwitheachothertomeetthe\nsame goals.\nMechanisms of Intercommunication Among Members\nThe guitar jam group communicated primarily through the\nMeetup.com site. This is how we recruited new members, shared\ninformation about when and where we were playing, and\ncommunicated with each other outside of the night of the guitar\njam.\u201cPeoplewhouseMeetup.com\u201darenotadiscoursecommunity,\nbecause even though they\u2019re using the same method of\ncommunication, they don\u2019t all share the same goals and they don\u2019t\nallregularlyinteractwitheachother.ButaMeetup.comgrouplike\nthe Sacramento acoustic guitar jam focused on a specific topic\nwith shared goals and a community of members who frequently\ninteractcanbeconsideredadiscoursecommunitybasedonSwales\u2019\ndefinition.\nUse of These Communication Mechanisms to Provide\nInformation and Feedback\nOnce I found the guitar jam group on Meetup.com, I wanted\ninformation about topics like what skill levels could participate,\nwhat kind of music they played, and where and when they met.\nOnceIwasatmyfirstguitarjam,theprimaryinformationIneeded\nwasthechordsandlyricsofeachsong,sothehandoutswithchords\nand lyrics were a key means of providing critical information to\ncommunity members. Communication mechanisms in discourse\ncommunitiescanbeemails,textmessages,socialmediatools,print\ntexts,memes,oralpresentations,andsoon.OnereasonthatSwales\nuses the term \u201cdiscourse\u201d instead of \u201cwriting\u201d is that the term\n\u201cdiscourse\u201d can mean any type of communication, from talking to\nwriting to music to images to multimedia.\n314 | Understanding Discourse Communities OneorMoreGenresThatHelpFurthertheGoalsoftheDiscourse\nCommunity\nOne of the most common ways discourse communities share\ninformationandmeettheirgoalsisthroughgenres.Tohelpexplain\nthe concept of genre, I\u2019ll use music since I\u2019ve been talking about\nplaying guitar and music is probably an example you can relate to.\nObviously there are many types of music, from rap to country to\nreggaetoheavymetal.Eachofthesetypesofmusicisconsidereda\ngenre,inpartbecausethemusichassharedfeatures,fromthestyle\nof the music to the subject of the lyrics to the lexis. For example,\nmost rap has a steady bass beat, most rappers use spoken word\nrathersinging,andraplyricsusuallydrawonalexisassociatedwith\nyoung people. But a genre is much more than a set of features.\nGenres arise out of social purposes, and they\u2019re a form of social\nactionwithindiscoursecommunities.Therapbattlesoftodayhave\nhistorical roots in African oral contests, and modern rap music\ncan only be understood in the context of hip hop culture, which\nincludesbreakdancingandstreetart.Rapalsohassocialpurposes,\nincluding resisting social oppression and telling the truth about\nsocial conditions that aren\u2019t always reported on by news outlets.\nLike all genres, rap is not just a formula but a tool for social action.\nTheguitarjamgroupusedtwoprimarygenrestomeetthegoals\nof the community. The Meetup.com site was one important genre\nthatwascriticalintheformationofthegroupandtohelpitrecruit\nnew members. It was also the genre that delivered information to\nthemembersaboutwhatthecommunitywasaboutandwhereand\nwhenthecommunitywouldbemeeting.Theotherimportantgenre\nto the guitar jam group were the handouts with song chords and\nlyrics. I\u2019m sharing an example of a song I brought to the group to\nshow you what this genre looks like.\nUnderstanding Discourse Communities | 315 Figure 1: Lyrics and chord changes for \u201cHeart of Gold\u201d by Neil Young with a\nfingering chart for an E minor 7 chord\nThis genre of the chord and lyrics sheet was needed to make sure\neveryone could play along and follow the singer. The conventions\nofthisgenre\u2014the\u201cnorms\u201d\u2014weren\u2019tjustarbitraryrulesorformulas.\nAswithallgenres,theconventionsdevelopedbecauseofthesocial\n316 | Understanding Discourse Communities actionofthegenre.Thesheetsincludedlyricssothatwecouldall\nsing along and make sure we knew when to change chords. The\nsheets included visuals of unusual chords, like the Em7 chord (E\nminor seventh) in my example, because there were some beginner\nguitarists who were a part of the community. If the community\nmembers were all expert guitarists, then the inclusion of chord\nshapes would never have become a convention. A great resource\nto learn more about the concept of genre is the essay \u201cNavigating\nGenres\u201d by Kerry Dirk in volume 1 ofWriting Spaces.\nA Specific Lexis (Specialized Language)\nToanyonewhowasn\u2019tamusician,ourguitarmeet-upsmighthave\nsounded like we were communicating in a foreign language. We\ntalked about the root note of scale, a 1\/4\/5 chord progression,\nputtingacapoondifferentfrets,whethertoplaysolosinamajoror\nminor scale, double drop D tuning, and so on. If someone couldn\u2019t\nquicklyidentifywhatkeytheirsongwasinorhowmanybeatsper\nmeasure the strumming pattern required, they wouldn\u2019t be able to\ncommunicate effectively with the community members. We didn\u2019t\nuse this language to show off or to try to discourage outsiders\nfrom joining our group. We needed these specialized terms\u2014this\nmusician\u2019s lexis\u2014to make sure we were all playing together\neffectively.\nA Threshold Level of Expert Members\nIf everyone in the guitar jam was at my beginner level when I first\njoined the group, we wouldn\u2019t have been very successful. I relied\nonmoreexperiencedplayerstofigureoutstrummingpatternsand\nchord changes, and I learned to improve my solos by watching\nother players use various techniques in their soloing. The most\nexperienced players also helped educate everyone on the\nUnderstanding Discourse Communities | 317 conventionsofthegroup(the\u201cnorms\u201dofhowthegroupinteracted).\nThese conventions included everyone playing in the same key,\neveryone taking turns playing solo lead guitar, and everyone\nbringingsongstoplay.Butdiscoursecommunityconventionsaren\u2019t\nalways just about maintaining group harmony. In most discourse\ncommunities, new members can also expand the knowledge and\ngenresofthecommunity.Forexample,Isharedsongsthatnoone\nhad brought before, and that expanded the community\u2019s base of\nknowledge.\nWhy the Concept of Discourse Communities Matters for\nCollege Writing\nWhen I was an undergraduate at the University of Florida, I didn\u2019t\nunderstand that each academic discipline I took courses in to\ncomplete the requirements of my degree (history, philosophy,\nbiology, math, political science, sociology, English) was a different\ndiscoursecommunity.Eachoftheseacademicfieldshadtheirown\ngoals, their own genres, their own writing conventions, their own\nformats for citing sources, and their own expectations for writing\nstyle. I thought each of the teachers I encountered in my\nundergraduatecareerjusthadtheirownpersonalpreferencesthat\nall felt pretty random to me. I didn\u2019t understand that each teacher\nwastryingtoactasarepresentativeofthediscoursecommunityof\ntheirfield.Iwasanewmemberoftheirdiscoursecommunities,and\nthey were introducing me to the genres and conventions of their\ndisciplines.Unfortunately,teachersaresousedtotheconventions\nof their discourse communities that they sometimes don\u2019t explain\nto students the reasons behind the writing conventions of their\ndiscourse communities.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I studied research about college writing while I\nwas in graduate school that I learned about genres and discourse\ncommunities, and by the time I was doing my dissertation for my\nPhD, I got so interested in studying college writing that I did a\n318 | Understanding Discourse Communities national study of college teachers\u2019 writing assignments and syllabi.\nBelieveitornot,Ianalyzedthegenresanddiscoursecommunities\nof over 2,000 college writing assignments in my book Assignments\nAcross the Curriculum. To show you why the idea of discourse\ncommunity is so important to college writing, I\u2019m going to share\nwith you some information from one of the academic disciplines\nI studied: history. First I want to share with you an excerpt from\na history course writing assignment from my study. As you read\nit over, think about what it tells you about the conventions of the\ndiscourse community of history.\nDocumentary Analysis\nThisassignmentrequiresyoutoplaythedetective,combingtextual\nsources for clues and evidence to form a reconstruction of past\nevents.IfyoutookA.P.historycoursesinhighschool,youmayrecall\ndoing similar document-based questions (DBQs).

If so,\nhow do you account for it?\n\u2022 Do they shed light on a historical event, problem, or period?\nHow do they fit into the \u201cbig picture\u201d?\n\u2022 What incidental information can you glean from them by\nreading carefully? Such information is important for\nconstructing a narrative of the past; our medieval authors\nalmost always tell us more than they intended to.\n\u2022 What is not said, but implied?\n\u2022 What is left out? (As a historian, you should always look for\nwhat is not said, and ask yourself what the omission signifies.)\n\u2022 Taken together, do the documents reveal anything significant\nabout the period in question? (Melzer 3-4)\nThis assignment doesn\u2019t just represent the specific preferences of\nonerandomteacher.It\u2019sacommonhistorygenre(thedocumentary\nanalysis)thathelpsintroducestudentstothewaysofthinkingand\nthe communication conventions of the discourse community of\nhistorians. This genre reveals that historians look for textual clues\nto reconstruct past events and that historians bring their own\nknowledge to bear when they analyze texts and interpret history\n(historians are not entirely \u201cobjective\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d). In this\ndocumentary analysis genre, the instructor emphasizes that\nhistorians are always looking for what is not said but instead is\nimplied. This instructor is using an important genre of history to\nintroduce students to the ways of analyzing and thinking in the\ndiscourse community of historians. Let\u2019s look at another history\ncourse in my research. I\u2019m sharing with you an excerpt from the\n320 | Understanding Discourse Communities syllabus of a history of the American West course. This part of the\nsyllabus gives students an overview of the purpose of the writing\nprojectsintheclass.Asyoureadthisoverview,thinkabouttheways\nthis instructor is portraying the discourse community of historians.\nA300: History of the American West\nA300 is designed to allow students to explore the history of the\nAmerican West on a personal level with an eye toward expanding\ntheirknowledgeofvariouswesternthemes,fromexplorationtothe\nIndianWars,totheimpactofglobalcapitalismandtheemergence\noftheenvironmentalmovement.Butstudentswillalsolearnabout\nthecraftofhistory,includingthetoolsusedbypractitioners,howto\nweighcompetingevidence,andhowtobuildaconvincingargument\nabout the past.\nAttheendofthiscoursestudentsshouldunderstandthathistory\nissociallyinterpreted,andthatthepasthasalwaysbeenusedasan\nimportantmeansforunderstandingthepresent.Oldfamilyphotos,\na grandparent\u2019s memories, even family reunions allow people to\nunderstand their lives through an appreciation of the past. These\nevents and artifacts remind us that history is a dynamic and\ninterpretive field of study that requires far more than rote\nmemorization. Historians balance their knowledge of primary\nsources (diaries, letters, artifacts, and other documents from the\nperiod under study) with later interpretations of these people,\nplaces, and events (in the form of scholarly monographs and\narticles) known as secondary sources. Through the evaluation and\ndiscussion of these different interpretations historians come to a\nsocially negotiated understanding of historical figures and events.\nIndividual Projects\nMore generally, your papers should:\nUnderstanding Discourse Communities | 321 1. Empathize with the person, place, or event you are writing\nabout. The goal here is to use your understanding of the\nprimary and secondary sources you have read to \u201cbecome\u201d that\nperson\u2013i.e. to appreciate their perspectives on the time or\nevent under study. In essence, students should demonstrate an\nappreciation of that time within its context.\n2. Second, students should be able to present the past in terms of\nits relevance to contemporary issues. What do their individual\nprojects tell us about the present?

In this chapter fromWriting Spaces: Readings\nAbout Writing, Volume 4, students are introduced to moves\nanalysis, first describing what it is and then explaining\nvarious strategies for analyzing moves.

The goal of the chapter\nis to familiarize students with rhetorical moves analysis as a\npractical tool for understanding new genres and for\nidentifying options that can help writers carry out their\ngoals.\nThis reading is available below or as aPDF. The PDF\nincludes additional appendices and teacher resources.\nIf you are like most students, you\u2019ve probably had to miss a class\nat some point. Maybe you were sick, stayed up too late the night\nbefore,orjustweren\u2019tprepared.Whenyou\u2019vefoundyourselfinthis\nsituation, have you emailed your professor about your absence?\nIf so, how much information did you share? Did you include an\napology, or maybe an explanation of how you plan to make up\nany missed work? You may not realize it, but the email written\nto a teacher in this situation can be considered a genre. You\u2019ve\nprobably heard the term genre used in relation to music, film, art,\norliterature,butitisalsousedtodescribenon-literarywriting,like\nthewritingwedoinourpersonallives,atschool,andatwork.These\ngenrescanbethoughtofascategoriesofwriting.Thesecategories\nare based on what the writing is trying to do, as well as who it\nis written for and the context it is written in (Dirk; Miller).

A student absence\nemailletsateacherknowaboutanabsenceandmightalsorequest\ninformation for how to make up a missed class.\nYouencountermanygenreseveryday.Inyourpersonallife,these\nmight include to-do lists, menus, political ads, and text messages\ntoscheduleaget-together.Inschool,youmaywriteingenreslike\n328 | Make Your Move: Writing in Genres proposals, lab reports, and university admission essays. People in\nprofessions often write in highly specialized genres: nurses write\ncare plans; lawyers write legal briefs; scientists write research\narticles, and so on. (For a more in-depth introduction to the\ndefinition and functions of genre, check out Dirk\u2019s \u201cNavigating\nGenres\u201d chapter inWriting SpacesVol. 1.)\nTexts within a genre category aren\u2019t identical, but they often\nresemble each other in many ways. For example, they might use\nsimilarkindsofvocabularyandgrammar,designfeatures,content,\nand patterns for organizing their content. Because of these\nresemblances, we can often recognize texts as belonging to a\nparticular genre\u2014as in figure 1.\nFigure 1: Four-star restaurant review of Boca Tacos & Tequila, posted April 19,\n2020. Text reads: \u201cThe food was amazing! Had \u2018The Burro\u2019 hands down one of\nthe best carne asada burros I\u2019ve had. Extremely huge could easily feed two\npeople.

It may sound\nintimidating, but it\u2019s just a (sort of) fancy phrase to describe\nsomething you probably already do. Rhetorical moves\u2014also just\ncalled moves\u2014are the parts of a text that carry out specific goals;\ntheyhelpwritersaccomplishthemainactionofthegenre(Swales).\nFor example, a typical wedding invitation in the United States\nincludes moves like inviting (\u201cYou are invited to attend\u2026\u201d) and\nproviding venue information (\u201c\u2026at the Tucson Botanical Gardens\u201d).\nThese moves are necessary to carry out the genre\u2019s main action;\nwithout an inviting move, an invitation could easily fail to\naccomplish its goal, and without a providing venue information\nmove,attendeeswon\u2019tknowwheretogo!Aweddinginvitationcan\nalso include optional moves like recognizing parents (\u201cJordan and\nJaime Taylor request your company at\u2026\u201d) or signaling appropriate\nattire (\u201cBlack tie optional\u201d). Optional moves often respond to\nspecific aspects of a situation or give writers a way to express\ncertainidentitiesorpersonalgoals.Weddinginvitationsindifferent\ncountries or cultural communities can have different common\nmoves as well. In China, for example, wedding invitations often\ninclude the character fordouble happiness(\u56cd).\nEven a text as short as a restaurant review can include multiple\nmoves.Themainactionofarestaurantreviewistotellotherpeople\nabouttherestaurantsothattheycandecidewhethertoeatthereor\n330 | Make Your Move: Writing in Genres not,sothemovesthatawriterincludesworktowardthatgoal.The\nreview in Figure 1 includes three moves:\n\u2022 evaluating the restaurant overall (\u201cThe food was amazing!\u201d)\n\u2022 evaluating specific dishes (\u201c\u2026one of the best carne asada\nburros I\u2019ve had\u2026,\u201d \u201cTheir salsa was amazing\u2026\u201d)\n\u2022 providing details about the price (\u201cIt was a little on the pricey\nside\u2026\u201d)\nAfter looking at just one restaurant review, we don\u2019t really know\nif these are typical moves or if they are just unique to this one\nconsumer\u2019s review. To understand what moves are common to\nconsumer restaurant reviews (which might be a bit different than\nprofessionalrestaurantreviews),weneedtolookatmanyexamples\nof texts in that genre. As a writer, it can be very useful to look\nfor moves that are required (sometimes called obligatory moves),\ncommon, optional, and rare.

Start by asking yourself, \u201cWhat does the genre help the\nreaders and writers do?\u201d and \u201cHow do certain moves help carry\n336 | Make Your Move: Writing in Genres out these actions?\u201d Keep in mind that a genre may serve multiple\npurposes. You might send an email to excuse yourself from an\nupcoming class, to explain a previous absence (see Sample 3), ask\nquestions about missed material (see Sample 2), to request an\nextension on an assignment (see Sample 3), and so on.\nBasedonTable1,atleastonemovecouldbeconsideredessential\nforthisgenrebecauseitisfoundinallfoursamples:informingthe\ninstructor about an absence.

Do the writers of requests\ncarry them out in similar ways?\nWecouldcontinuegoingthrougheachmove,lookingforpatterns\nand considering rhetorical effects by asking a) why each move is\ntypical or not, b) what role each move plays in carrying out the\ngenre\u2019s purpose(s), and c) how and why moves are sequenced in a\nparticular way.\nIdentifying Options and Variations in Moves\nVariation across genre samples is likely to occur because of\ndifferencesincontext,audience,andwriters\u2019preferences.Butsome\ngenresallowformorevariationthanothers.Ifyou\u2019veeverwrittena\nMake Your Move: Writing in Genres | 337 labreport,youlikelyreceivedveryspecificinstructionsabouthow\nto describe the materials and methods you used in an experiment\nand how to report and discuss your findings.

How do you think a professor\nwould respond to each email? Understanding your options as a\nwriter and learning how to identify their purposes and effects can\nhelp you make informed choices when navigating a new or\nunfamiliar genre.\nIdentifying Common Language Features\nWritersmakelinguisticchoicestocarryoutmoves,andoftentimes\nyou\u2019ll find similarities across samples of a genre. While there are\n338 | Make Your Move: Writing in Genres seemingly infinite features of language we could analyze, here are\nsome to consider:\n\u2022 verb tense\n\u2022 passive\/active voice\n\u2022 contractions (e.g., it\u2019s, I\u2019m, we\u2019re, you\u2019ve)\n\u2022 sentence types\n\u2022 sentence structures\n\u2022 word choice\n\u2022 use of specialized vocabulary\n\u2022 use of pronouns\nTo dig deeper into the linguistic features of moves, we could take\nafewdifferentapproaches.First,wecouldviewthegenresamples\nside-by-side and look for language-level patterns. This method\nworks well when your genre samples are short and easy to skim.\nWe noticed, for example, that all four student absence emails use\nfirst-personpronouns(I,me,my,we,us),whichmakessensegiven\nthat this genre is a type of personal correspondence. Would it be\npossible to write in this genrewithoutusing personal pronouns?\nOuranalysiscouldalsofocusonhowlanguageisusedtocarryout\nasinglemoveacrossgenresamples.Usingthismethod,wenoticed\nthat in both of the samples that included requests to the teacher,\nthestudentsusetheauxiliaryverbcouldtomaketheirrequests.In\nSample 2, Layla asks, \u201cCould you let me know what I need to do\ntomakeupthemissedmaterial?\u201dInSample3,Coreyasks,\u201cCouldI\npossiblyhavea24-hourextension?\u201dThereareotherpossibilitiesfor\nphrasingbothquestionsmoredirectly,suchas\u201cWhatdoIneedto\ndo?\u201dor\u201cCanIhavea24-hourextension?\u201dWhymightitbebeneficial\nto phrase requests indirectly in this genre?\nYou don\u2019t need to be a linguistic expert to analyze language\nfeatures of a genre. Sometimes all it takes is noticing a word that\nseems out of place (like the use of the greeting \u201cHi\u201d instead of\n\u201cDearProfessor\u201d)orfindingaphrasethatisrepeatedacrossgenre\nsamples.

By\ncritiquing a genre, we are doing more than identifying its faults or\nlimitations, though that can certainly be part of the process. We\nmightalsolookforpotentialstrengthsofthegenreandpossibilities\nforshifting,adapting,ortransformingit.Theuseofthegreeting\u201cHi\u201d\nin Sample 4 could be an interesting start to a critique about how\nformal this genre is or should be. While we understand why some\nprofessorsfindittooinformaltobeaddressedwitha\u201cHi\u201dor\u201cHey,\u201d\nwe also see this move as evidence of how the genre\u2019s norms and\nexpectationsareseeminglychanging.Wepersonallydon\u2019tfindthese\ngreetings as jarring or inappropriate as we might have 5-10 years\nago. Our reactions might have to do with our individual teaching\nstyles, but email etiquette may also be changing more broadly.

Here are some questions to\nget you started on a critique of rhetorical moves (some have been\nadapted from Devitt, et al.\u2019sScenes of Writing):\n\u2022 Do all moves have a clear purpose and help carry out the social\nactions of the genre?\n340 | Make Your Move: Writing in Genres \u2022 What is the significance behind the sequence of the moves?\n\u2022 What are consequences for the writer or other users if certain\nmoves are included, or not?\n\u2022 Who seems to have freedom to break from common moves?\nWho does not?\n\u2022 What do the moves suggest about the relationship between the\nwriters and users of this genre? How might this relationship\nimpact the inclusion\/exclusion of certain moves?\n\u2022 What do the moves suggest about the values of a broader\ncommunity (i.e. a specific class, a specific institution, or the\nentire educational system of the region)?\nA critique of moves might also lead you to find ways to express\nyourownidentityorbendmoretraditionalconventionsofagenre.\nForexample,U.S.weddinginvitationstraditionallyincludedamove\nwhich recognized the parents of the bride as the hosts of the\nwedding(e.g.,\u201cMr.andMrs.JohnSmithrequestthepleasureofyour\ncompany at the marriage of their daughter [bride] to [groom]\u201d). A\ncritique of this move shows that it reflects a more gender-biased\nsocial view, in which a female is given to a male by her parents.\nToday, many (perhaps even most) couples omit this move entirely.\nApplying Moves Analysis: Writing a Statement of Need\nMoves analysis can help as you write in different classes or other\npersonalorprofessionalsituations.Let\u2019stakealookathowwecan\nusemovesanalysistoapproachacomplicatedorunfamiliargenre.\nYou can use the chart in the Appendix as you follow along.\nIn one of Brad\u2019s writing courses, students used moves analysis\nwhen they wrote a grant proposal on behalf of a local nonprofit\norganization.

This section lays out the stakes of the problem and\nproposes the solution. To learn more about how these Statements\nwork,Brad\u2019sclassreviewedseveralsamplesfromCandidLearning\u2019s\ncollectionofsuccessfulgrantproposals(\u201cSampleDocuments\u201d).Let\u2019s\ntake a look at some of the moves students identified in three\nsamples. These proposals were requesting funds for educational\ndevelopment in Uganda (Proposal from Building Tomorrow), an\ninterpreter training center (Proposal from Southeast Community\nCollege), and community-based art programming (Proposal from\nThe Griot Project).\nIdentifying Typical Moves in Statements of Need\nFirst, Brad and his students identified moves in the individual\nStatements, using verbs to describe them. Then, we compared\nmoves across the samples. Here are three of the moves we found:\nConnect Proposal to Broad Social Issue\nThe writers included statistics or other data from credible\nsources as a way to establish the need or problem and connect to\nbroader societal issues. Here are a few examples of this move in\naction:\n342 | Make Your Move: Writing in Genres \u2022 UNICEF and USAIDS estimate that 42 million children in this\nregion alone are without access to primary education.\n(Proposal from Building Tomorrow)\n\u2022 A study, published in January of 2006 in the journal Pediatrics\nshows that ad hoc interpreters were much more likely than\nprofessionally trained interpreters to make errors that could\nlead to serious clinical consequences, concluding that\nprofessionally trained medical interpreters are essential in\nhealth care facilities. (Proposal from Southeast Community\nCollege)\nWhy do you think the writers reference respected sources, like\nUNICEF, USAIDS, and the journal Pediatrics? Brad\u2019s students\nthoughtthismovecouldbothhelpthegrantwriterbuildcredibility\nwith their reader and show how the project will impact a social\nproblem that goes beyond their local context. We did not see this\nmoveinallofthesamples,sowe\u2019dsaythismoveiscommonbutnot\nnecessarily obligatory for this genre.\nDemonstrate Local Need\nGrant writers have to show the local problem their project is\ngoing to solve and why it\u2019s needed. For example:\n\u2022 Officials in the Wakiso District of Uganda\u2026estimate that 55%\nof the district\u2019s 600,000 children do not have access to\neducation. (Proposal from Building Tomorrow)\n\u2022 Statewide, 143,251 people speak a language other than English\nat home. In Lancaster County, that number is 24,717, up 260%\nsince 1990 (U.S. Census 1990, 2000, 2005). (Proposal from\nSoutheast Community College)\n\u2022 As community constituents, we have observed a lack of after\nschool and summer enrichment projects that utilize the power\nof art as a means of community unification. (Proposal from The\nGriot Project)\nStudents decided this move is obligatory because it\u2019s in all of the\nMake Your Move: Writing in Genres | 343 samples.Thismakessensebecausegrantwritersneedtoshowwhy\ntheir project is important. Referencing outside sources appears to\nbe common within this move, but not required. Why do you think\nreferencing outside sources could be effective, given this move\u2019s\nrole in the genre?\nIdentify Solution and\/or Impact\nAt some point in the Statement, usually at the end, the grant\nwriterexplainshowtheirproposedprojectwillmeettheneedthey\nidentified:\nBy opening doors to new, accessible neighborhood\nclassrooms, BT can help reduce the dropout rate, provide\nchildren with the opportunity to receive a valuable\neducation, and be an instrumental partner in building a\nbetter tomorrow. (Proposal from Building Tomorrow)\nBrad\u2019sstudentsnoticedthismoveinalloftheStatements.Whydo\nyou think this move seems to beobligatory?\nUnderstanding How Moves Help Carry out the Genre\u2019s Social\nActions\nGiven what we know about grant proposals and the Statement,\nthese moves seem to be rhetorically effective when sequenced in\nthe order described above: connect to a societal problem,\ndemonstrate local need, and identify a solution or describe the\nimpactoftheproposedproject.Usingthesethreebasicmoveshelps\nwriters show that their proposed work is important and that they\nhaveaplantosolveaproblemwiththegrantmoney.Understanding\nthe Statement in this way led Brad\u2019s students to conduct further\nresearch into issues like food scarcity and access to health care\nthat affected their partner organizations so they could make\nconnections to social issues in their Statements.\n344 | Make Your Move: Writing in Genres Identifying Options and Variations in Moves\nThethreemovesidentifiedwereusedinmostofthegrantproposals\nBrad\u2019s students read. But students did notice variation. Remember\nthat even when moves seem obligatory or common, they won\u2019t\nnecessarilybefoundinthesameorder.Forexample,oneproposal\nidentifiedthelocalneedbeforeconnectingtoabroaderissue,and\nThe Griot Project\u2019s proposal did not include the connecting move\nat all, instead focusing solely on local knowledge to make their\ncase. Why do you think this might be? Here, it may help to learn\nmore about the audience. The Griot Project\u2019s grant proposal was\nsubmitted to Neighborhood Connections, an organization that\nprovides\u201cmoneyandsupportforgrassrootsinitiativesinthecities\nof Cleveland and East Cleveland.\u201d When the grant writers say, \u201cAs\ncommunity constituents, we have observed\u2026,\u201d they are localizing\ntheir efforts and showing how their project can be considered a\n\u201cgrassroots initiative.\u201d Understanding the audience can be one\nfactor in understanding variation among samples.\nIdentifying Common Language Features\nWhen students looked across the samples, they noticed personal\npronouns like I, we, or us were optional or rare. In fact, the only\npersonalpronounwasinthedemonstratinglocalneedmove,where\none organization referenced their own observation (\u201cwe have\nobserved\u201d) to demonstrate the local need. However, they shifted\nbacktothirdpersonwhenidentifyingtheimpact(\u201ctheGriotProject\nwillimprove\u201d),liketheothersamples.Whydoyouthinkthewriters\nincludedthemselvessoexplicitlyinthetextwhendemonstratingthe\nlocalneed,whiletherestofthesamplesmaintainedamoredistant\nposition? What might be gained with this choice, and why might\nsome writers hesitate? Why do you think all of the writers used\nthird person pronouns whenidentifying the organization\u2019s impact?\nStudents also noticed a common sentence structure in the\nMake Your Move: Writing in Genres | 345 identifying move, which we called \u201cBy x-ing.\u201d Each of the grant\nwriters used a single sentence and a By x-ing phrase to connect\ntheproposedinterventiontoanoutcome.Forexample,\u201cByopening\ndoors\u2026BT can help reduce the dropout rate\u2026\u201d (emphasis added).\nWhy do you think this sentence structure seems to be common\nwithin this move?\nCritiquing Moves\nStaff members from an organization supporting economic\ndevelopment on Native American sovereign lands reminded\nmembers of Brad\u2019s class that writing a grant proposal means\nrepresenting an organization and the people and communities it\nserves. With this in mind, they asked students to emphasize the\nresilience of the community rather than perpetuate negative\nstereotypesinthegrantproposals;theydidn\u2019twantapitycampaign.\nAsaresultofthisconversation,studentsdecidedtohighlightlocal\nconditionslikealackofgrocerystoresandaccesstotransportation\nbeforeintroducingstatisticsaboutobesityanddiabetesrates.They\nalso included pictures of happy families to counter stereotypical\nimagesofpoverty.Inthisway,critiqueofthegenreledtosubtle,yet\nimportant, transformation.\nClearly, a moves analysis like this could go on for a while!\nRemember,we\u2019renotlookingforthe\u201cright\u201danswer\u2014we\u2019retryingto\nunderstandtheoptionsthatwehaveaswebegintocontributeour\nown examples to the genre.\nProducing and Transforming Genres using Moves Analysis\nCarrying out a moves analysis is more than just an academic\nexercise. You can use this process whenever you need to write in\na new genre. Maybe you are applying for summer internships and\nyou are writing a cover letter for the first time. Instead of starting\n346 | Make Your Move: Writing in Genres from what you think a cover letter might look like, you can find\nseveral samples and conduct a moves analysis to identify features\nof this genre.

Grammar, Rhetoric, and\nStyle\nCRAIG HULST\nAbstract\nCraig Hulst\u2019s article fromWriting Spaces; Readings on\nWriting, Volume 3focuses on grammar, specifically on\nunderstanding that grammar is much more than just the\nrules that we have been taught. Rather, grammar can be\nused rhetorically\u2014with an understanding of the writing\nsituation and making appropriate choices regarding the\nstructure of the sentences, the use of punctuation, using\nactive or passive voice, etc. In other words, this chapter\nfocuses on using grammar to influence a piece of writing\u2019s\nstyle, rather than focusing on the correctness of the\ngrammar. Readers are encouraged to look at the writing\nthat they see in their casual or research reading and\nevaluate the grammar of those pieces to gain a better\nunderstanding of how they can control their own use of\ngrammar.\nThis reading is available below or as aPDF.

Grammar rules are concerned\nwithcorrectness\u2014tomakesurethatwearefollowingtheaccepted\nguidelines of the language. However, grammar isn\u2019t all about rules.\nInstead, grammar is about making meaning. People understand us\nbecause we are using grammar\u2014we are arranging our words in\na certain order, and because of that, our audience understands\nus. For example, if I said, \u201cstore went to Jim the,\u201d you\u2019d probably\nask, \u201cWhat?\u201d But if I used the same words and arranged the words\naccording to the grammar that I absorbed at a young age, I would\nsay, \u201cJim went to the store.\u201d By arranging the words according to\nwhatthoselisteningtomeexpectfrommygrammar,myaudience\nwould know exactly what I meant. And this awareness of what the\naudience needs is the heart of what I am talking about\u2014that\ngrammar has arhetoricaluse.\nGrammar simply means \u201ca system that puts words together into\nmeaningfulunits\u201d(Morenberg4).We\u2019vealreadyseenhowthatworks\nin the earlier example of \u201cJim went to the store.\u201d As we create\nlengthierandmorecomplexsentences,weincorporatepunctuation\nsuch as commas and semicolons, consider pronoun\/antecedent\nconnections, carefully think about verb shifts and a host of other\nissuesthatcanaffectthemeaningofourwords.Thisiswhatmost\npeople think of when they hear the word grammar.

Style refers to the choices that an author\nmakes\u2014choicesaboutpunctuation,wordusage,andgrammar\u2014and\nthose choices are influenced by the rhetorical situation that the\nauthor finds herself in. For example, consider the following\nsentences:\n\u2022 Katelyn was concerned that Chloe worked late every night.\nGrammar, Rhetoric, and Style | 357 \u2022 It concerned Katelyn that every night Chloe worked late.\n\u2022 Chloe worked late every night, and Katelyn was concerned.\n\u2022 Every night Chloe worked late, and that concerned Katelyn.\nEach of these sentences say the same thing, and the grammar is\n\u201ccorrect\u201d in each, but the sentence an author chooses depends\non the style she wishes to use. The first sentence is the most\nstraightforward,butthelasttwoputtheemphasisonChloerather\nthan on Katelyn, which might be what the author wants to do.\nSometimes the style within a specific rhetorical situation is\nprescribed for us; for example, we might be told that we cannot\nuse \u201cI\u201d in a paper. Sometimes the style is expected, but we aren\u2019t\nnecessarily told the rhetorical situation\u2019s rules; we might be\nexpectedtousetheactivevoiceratherthanthepassivevoiceinour\npapers. And sometimes the situation is wide open, allowing us to\nmake the grammatical style choices we like.\nAlso wrapped up in this issue of style is the concept of standard\nand preferred usage. Usage is simply the way we expect words\nto be used\u2014and this doesn\u2019t always follow the rules. For example,\na famous line from the original Star Trek series tells us that the\nEnterprise\u2019smissionis\u201ctoboldlygowherenomanhasgonebefore.\u201d\nThis seems right\u2014but there is a split infinitive in the phrase (no\nneed to worry about what a split infinitive is right now). To abide\nby the rule, the line should say, \u201cto go boldly where no man has\ngone before.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t sound as right to most of us, so a\ndecisionwasmadetobreaktheruleandwritethelineaccordingto\nthe common usage of adding an adverb before the verb.\nWhat usage is preferred is also dependent on the rhetorical\nsituation of the text. As an example of the differences between\nstandard and preferred usage, consider contractions. Most of the\ntime when we speak, and often in informal writing, it is perfectly\nfine to use contractions like \u201ccan\u2019t,\u201d \u201cisn\u2019t,\u201d or \u201caren\u2019t;\u201d contractions\nare standard usage. You may have been told in your composition\nclass that using contractions is okay in your papers, but using\ncontractions is not preferred in many rhetorical situations, as in a\n358 | Grammar, Rhetoric, and Style formallywrittenresearchpaper.Weusethewords\u201cI\u201dand\u201cyou\u201dall\nthe time when we speak, but we will find many writing situations\nwhere they aren\u2019t acceptable (i.e. preferred). Knowing what usage\nis preferred takes a little insight into the rhetorical situation\u2014you\ncan read examples of the type of writing that you are asked to do,\nyou can question friends who have already taken the course, you\ncan seek advice from books or the internet, or you can ask your\ninstructor. Since grammar, style, and usage are so closely related,\nandquitepossiblytheyhavealreadybeenintroducedtoyouasthe\nsamething,throughoutthisessayIwilloftenrefertothesetypesof\nstyle choices as grammar choices.\nAll Together Now\nWhenwewrite,weareenteringintoaconversationwithourreader,\nand the grammatical choices that we consciously make can show\nour readers that we understand what they want from us, and that\nwe are giving them what they expect. In your academic writing,\nthe rhetorical situation demands that you make grammar choices\nthat are appropriate for college-level writers. Unfortunately, these\ngrammar choices are not static; they will change\u2014perhaps only\nslightly, perhaps greatly\u2014as your writing situation changes, as you\nwrite for different teachers, courses, or disciplines. In your other\nwriting,therhetoricalsituationmaycallforanentirelydifferentset\nof grammar choices.\nHere\u2019sanexampleofhowtherhetoricalsituationaffectsgrammar\nusage.Youneedtoexpressanideaconcerningtheneedtorecycle.\nIn the first rhetorical situation, you are speaking to your friends,\npeople that you have known since you were five years old. In such\na situation, it might be acceptable for you to say, \u201cIt ain\u2019t rocket\nscience, bonehead. Recycle that junk and save the Earth.\u201d If you\u2019re\nspeaking to your mother, you might say, \u201cMom, that can go in the\nrecyclingbininstead.Let\u2019ssavetheplanet.\u201dIfyouarewritingabout\nthis for an academic audience, you might instead say, \u201cWe must\nGrammar, Rhetoric, and Style | 359 always consider the consequences of our actions. Throwing\nrecyclable materials in the trash results in overflowing landfills,\nlandandwaterpollution,andanincreasedstrainonrawmaterials.\nHowever, recycling glass, metal, and paper reduces our\nconsumption of these materials as well as lowers the fossil fuel\nenergy needed to create new products.\u201d The example should not\nsuggest that longer sentences are more correct, although the\nacademic audience example is considerably longer than the other\ntwo. Hopefully, if I have done it right, the academic audience\nexample is longer simply because I am proving my point, not\nbecause I\u2019m trying to sound smart by using more words. But the\ngrammarhasalsochanged.Inthefirstexample,Iused\u201cain\u2019t,\u201dwhich\nis not considered grammatically correct for most academic\naudiences,buttheuseofwhichisquitecommoninmanyvarieties\nof spoken English. In the second example I used the contraction\n\u201ccan\u2019t,\u201d which, again, in many academic writing situations would\nbe frowned upon. In the final example, I have attempted to use\n\u201cstandard\u201d grammar, the grammar that the academic rules say I\nshoulduse,asIknowthatthatparticularaudiencewouldexpectme\nto do so.\nInmanyacademicwritingsituations,theworkisassessed,inpart,\non how well the writer adheres to the rules. If I used the style\nandgrammarofthefirstexampleinapaperformyEnvironmental\nScience class, you can imagine what could happen. Writing an\nacademic paper as if I was talking to my friends would probably\nnegativelyaffectmygrade.However,thepoorgradewouldn\u2019tmean,\n\u201cyour grammar is wrong,\u201d even if my instructor phrased it that\nway. Instead, what the grade would mean is that I did not use the\nappropriate grammar required for the rhetorical situation.\nUsing Grammar Rhetorically for Style\nGrammarian and textbook author Martha Kolln asks us to look at\nsentences as a series of slots into which we place words (5). We\n360 | Grammar, Rhetoric, and Style know what to put into certain slots; for example, in the \u201csubject\u201d\nslot we know we need a noun or a pronoun, and in the \u201cverb\u201d slot\nwe need, well, a verb. Knowing just these two slots, I can make\na good sentence: \u201cI laughed.\u201d As sentences get more and more\nsophisticated,moreslotsbecomeavailable.Forexample,addingan\nadverb slot, I can create the following sentence: \u201cI laughed loudly.\u201d\nThis is a basic element of the rules\u2014the rules tell us what we are\nallowed to put into the slots.\nSo then, how do we move past the rules? How does a writer\nuse grammar rhetorically? First and foremost, you use grammar\nthis way by being conscious of the choices that you are making.\nRemember, when you write, you aren\u2019t simply putting words on\npaper;youareconstructingaconversationwithareader.Youmake\nconscious choices about your topic, your title, and your word\nchoice, as well as many other choices, in order to carry on that\nconversation\u2014grammarisjustpartofthemanychoicesthatyoucan\nusetoyouradvantagewhenyouareusinglanguageforyourspecific\npurpose. It might help you to see how this is done by looking at\nworksthathavebeenwrittenforavarietyofaudiencesandtryingto\nfigureoutwhytheauthorsmadethegrammaticalchoicesthatthey\ndid.\nThroughouttherestofthisessay,Iwillpresentseveralexamples\nof writing, and I will look at what each author has chosen to put\nintotheirsentenceslotsandwhytheymadethosechoices.Thefirst\nexampleisaparagraphfromthemanualforthevideogameFallout\n3:\nNuclear war. The very words conjure images of mushroom\nclouds, gas masks, and bewildered children ducking and\ncovering under their school desks. But it\u2019s the aftermath\nof such a conflict that truly captures our imagination, in\nlarge part because there\u2019s no real-world equivalent we can\nrelate to. Mankind may have witnessed the horror of the\natomic bomb, but thankfully we\u2019ve somehow succeeded in\nGrammar, Rhetoric, and Style | 361 not blowing up the entire planet. At least, not yet. (Vault\nDweller\u2019s Survival Guide3)\nThis paragraph violates many of the rules that I learned as a\ndeveloping writer. For example, I see the contractions it\u2019s, there\u2019s,\nand we\u2019ve, and a conjunction, but, starts a sentence. I see the\npreposition to ending a sentence\u2014a definite no-no, if I remember\nmy grammar rules. Also, as I write this on my computer, my word\nprocessorisverykindlyinformingmethattherearetwofragments\nin this paragraph. I believe that Ms. Herrema, my eighth grade\nEnglishteacher,wouldcringeifshereadthisparagraphinastudent\npaper. Yet I think it unlikely that you noticed all of these \u201cerrors\u201d\nin the paragraph as you read it. Why didn\u2019t you? Is it because you\nare ignorant of the rules of grammar? Absolutely not! Assuming\nthat you didn\u2019t notice them, you didn\u2019t notice them because taken\nall together, the paragraph flowed well. The fragment sentence,\nNuclear war, didn\u2019t bother you\u2014in fact, it probably grabbed your\nattention. The contractions didn\u2019t bother you because it sounded\nlike someone was speaking to you. And they were.\nThe intended audience of the writer is those who would buy\nand play video games. (That might include you\u2014it does include\nme.) As such, the author knowledgeably chose the language, the\ngrammar, of the game manual in order to maintain the interest\nof the audience. We speak with contractions; the author uses\ncontractions.Wespeakinfragments;theauthorusesthem.Notice\nthat the author is using the fragments ominously. He (or she, but\nprobably they\u2014much professional writing is team written) begins\nwith Nuclear war.

Why does the author put those commas\nthere? Is it because the rules tell him to? Yes\u2014and no. Sure, the\nrules tell us to put those commas in there, but if we\u2019re relying\non the rhetorical use of grammar, we\u2019ll also use them in exactly\nthe same way. A comma indicates a pause in a sentence, a pause\nthat the audience needs in order to get the meaning the author\nintends to give them. Read that sentence out loud without the\ncommas: The very words conjure images of mushroom clouds gas\nmasks and bewildered children ducking and covering under their\nschool desks.

But Benzon, the author,\ndidnotwanttosaythat\u201cThetypewriterisatechnology.\u201dHewanted\nto say that it was effectively a lost technology.

The first is that there\nisnouseofI.Whydidn\u2019ttheauthorssay,\u201cWefedthepigsthebasal\ndiet during the initial 7 day period?\u201d The reason is that, unlike in\nthe humanities disciplines, the use of the personal pronoun is not\nexpected by a science audience. Using it would be counter to the\nexpectations of the audience, so it isn\u2019t used. (Score one for the\nmiddle school English teacher who told me not to useI.)\nThe second difference from the Benzon passage is that the\nsubjects of the sentences aren\u2019t doing anything; this passage is\nwritten in the passive voice.

Reflective Writing and the\nRevision Process: What Were\nYou Thinking?\nSANDRA L. GILES\nAbstract\nIn her article fromWriting Spaces; Readings on Writing,\nVolume 1, Sandra Giles explains to students that reflective\nwriting involves their thinking about their own thinking.\nThey may be asked to reflect about their audience and\npurpose for a piece of writing. They may write about their\ninvention, drafting, revision, and editing processes. They\nmay self-assess or evaluate their writing, learning, and\ndevelopment as writers. These activities help cement\nlearning. They also help writers gain more insight into and\ncontrol over composing and revising processes by helping\nthem gain critical distance and by providing a mechanism\nfor them to do the re-thinking and re-seeing that effective\nrevision requires. The article gives examples of student\nreflective writing, explains how they function in a student\u2019s\nlearning, and gives scholarly support for why these kinds of\nactivities are effective.\nThis reading is available below or as aPDF.\nReflective Writing and the Revision Process: What Were You\nThinking? | 369 \u201cReflection\u201d and \u201creflective writing\u201d are umbrella terms that refer\n1\nto any activity that asks you to think about your own thinking.\nAs composition scholars Kathleen Blake Yancey and Jane Bowman\nSmith explain, reflection records a \u201cstudent\u2019s process of thinking\nabout what she or he is doing while in the process of that doing\u201d\n(170). In a writing class, you may be asked to think about your\nwriting processes in general or in relation to a particular essay, to\nthink about your intentions regarding rhetorical elements such as\naudience and purpose, or to think about your choices regarding\ndevelopment strategies such as comparison-contrast,\nexemplification, or definition. You may be asked to describe your\ndecisions regarding language features such as word choice,\nsentencerhythm,andsoon.Youmaybeaskedtoevaluateorassess\nyour piece of writing or your development as a writer in general.\nYourinstructormayalsoaskyoutoperformthesekindsofactivities\natvariouspointsinyourprocessofworkingonaproject,oratthe\nend of the semester.\nA Writer\u2019s Experience\nThefirsttimeIhadtoperformreflectivewritingmyselfwasinthe\nsummer of 2002.

Next she identifies a particular\nproblem: the way \u201cthey\u201d define whether an applicant is dependent\non or independent of parents. So far, pretty good, except her use\nof the vague pronoun \u201cthey\u201d makes me hope she hasn\u2019t been that\nvagueintheessayitself.Partoftakingonatopicislearningenough\nabout it to be specific.

Is that really her main purpose? Either she doesn\u2019t\nhaveagoodhandleonwhatshewantsheressaytodoorshe\u2019sjust\nthrowing language around to sound good in the letter. Not good,\neither way.\nWhen she says she wants the readers to be all college students,\nReflective Writing and the Revision Process: What Were You\nThinking? | 375 she has identified her target audience, which is good.

It\u2019s completely fine, and normal,\nto use freewriting to generate ideas and then organize them with\nperhaps an outline as a second step. As a teacher, when I read\ncomments like this in a letter, I write a note to the student\nexplaining that \u201cjumbled\u201d is normal, perfectly fine, and nothing to\nworry about. I\u2019m glad when I read that sort of comment so I can\nreassurethestudent.Ifnotfortheletter,Iprobablywouldn\u2019thave\nknown of her unfounded concern.

I\u2019d advise\nher to address that problem and to better develop her overall\nstrategy, and then she would be in a better position to make a\nplan for the introduction. Again, a teaching moment. When she\nconcludesthesecondparagraphofthelettersayingthatshewants\nto include \u201cmany different arguments\u201d for \u201cdifferent types of\nstudents,\u201d it seems even more evident that she\u2019s not clear on\npurpose or strategy; therefore, she\u2019s just written a vague sentence\nshe probably thought sounded good for the letter.\nShe begins her third paragraph with further proof of the\nproblems. If her piece is to be persuasive, then she should not\n376 | Reflective Writing and the Revision Process: What Were You\nThinking? wantreadersto\u201cthinkforthemselvesandformtheirownopinion.\u201d\nShe most certainly should have included comments from other\nstudents,asherpeerrespondersadvised.Itwouldn\u2019tbedifficultto\ninterviewsomefellowstudentsatherownschool.Andasforfinding\nout what students at other schools think about the issue, a quick\nsearch on the Internet would turn up newspaper or newsletter\narticles,aswellasblogsandotherrelevantsources.Justbecausethe\nofficial assignment may not have been to write a \u201cresearch\u201d paper\ndoesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t research.

Anson makes the point that when an\ninstructor asks a student to verbalize his or her intentions, it is\nmuch more likely that the student will have intentions (qtd. in\nYancey and Smith 174). We saw this process in mid-struggle with\nourimaginarystudent\u2019swork(above),andwe\u2019llseeithandledmore\neffectively in real student examples (below). As many composition\nscholarsexplain,reflectiveandself-assessingactivitieshelpwriters\nset goals for their writing. For instance, Rebecca Moore Howard\nstatesthat\u201cwriterswhocanassesstheirownprosecansuccessfully\nrevise that prose\u201d (36). This position is further illustrated by\nXiaoguang Cheng and Margaret S. Steffenson, who conducted and\nthenreportedastudyclearlydemonstratingadirectpositiveeffect\nof reflection on student revising processes in \u201cMetadiscourse: A\nTechniqueforImprovingStudentWriting.\u201dYanceyandSmithargue\nthat self-assessment and reflection are essential to the learning\nprocess because they are a \u201cmethod for assigning both\nresponsibility and authority to a learner\u201d (170). Students then\nbecome independent learners who can take what they learn about\nwriting into the future beyond a particular class rather than\nremaining dependent on teachers or peer evaluators (171). Anson\nechoesthisidea,sayingthatreflectionhelpsawritergrowbeyond\nsimplysucceedinginaparticularwritingproject:\u201cOncetheybegin\nthinking about writing productively, they stand a much better\nchance of developing expertise and working more successfully in\nfuture writing situations\u201d (73).\nExamples From Real Students\nLet\u2019s see some examples from actual students now, although for\nthe sake of space we\u2019ll look at excerpts. The first few illustrate\n378 | Reflective Writing and the Revision Process: What Were You\nThinking? how reflective writing helps you develop your intentions. For an\nassignment to write a profile essay, Joshua Dawson described his\npurpose and audience: \u201cThis essay is about my grandmother and\nhow she overcame the hardships of life.

Bad Idea About Writing:\n\"Writing Knowledge Transfers\nEasily\"\nELLEN C. CARILLO\nAbstract\nComing from the essay compilationBad Ideas About\nWriting,the title of Ellen Carillo\u2019s essay, \u201cWriting\nKnowledge Transfers Easily,\u201d may be misleading until you\nread it in its entirety. Her argument is that for writing\nknowledge to transfer\u2014move from one class, situation, or\npaper to another, we have to work really hard. Ultimately,\nCarillo recommends that faculty and students work\ntogether to be metacognitive about writing \u2013 that is, to be\nacutely aware of our thinking throughout the process.\nThis reading is available below, as aPDF, or as apodcast.\nItmaynotbeanexaggerationtosaythattheverynotionofwriting\ninstruction is based on a myth. Writing courses, like courses in\nmany\u2014maybe all\u2014fields, are arranged in what we would call a\nvertical curriculum with students enrolling first in introductory\ncourses like freshman English. This course may be followed by a\nresearch-writing or similarly advanced writing course and then,\nperhaps, by a more intense writing course that often serves as\n| 387 a capstone seminar in the student\u2019s major. Certainly, there are\nvariations of this model, but the structure is largely consistent\nacross American post-secondary institutions in that students are\nexpected to take introductory writing courses before taking more\nadvancedones.Thereasoncurriculaaredesignedinthiswayisso\nthat students apply what they learn in those introductory courses\ntothemoreadvancedcoursesthatfollow.Thissoundslikecommon\nsense,no?Yet,itisamyththatstudentswillautomaticallyapply\u2014\nortransfer(thetermmostoftenusedineducationalpsychologyand\ncomposition studies) what they learn in their lower-level writing\ncourses to their upper-level ones. They simply won\u2019t.\nAnecdotally, writing instructors see this all the time: students\nentering a second-semester writing course as if they had no\nprevious college-level writing course (let alone one linked to that\nsecond-semester course), or students struggling with the writing\ncomponent of their senior seminars despite their taking the\nrequired introductory writing courses and writing-intensive\ncourse(s) in their majors. Any number of variables might account\nfor the experiences these anecdotes describe, but research\ncorroborates that students don\u2019t automatically transfer what they\nhave learned about writing from one class into the next.

Transfer is a concept\nthat has been studied for years by educational and cognitive\npsychologists, only recently becoming an interest of those in\ncompositionstudieswhoteachandresearchwritingdevelopment.\nEducationalpsychologistsGavrielSalomonandDavidPerkinsdefine\n388 | transfer as \u201cinstances in which learning in one context or with\nonesetofmaterialsimpactsonperformanceinanothercontextor\nwithotherrelatedmaterials.\u201dResearchontransferdatestotheturn\nof the 20th century. Educational psychologists Edward Thorndike\nandRobertWoodworthconductedtheearliestexperimentsin1901.\nThey found transfer to be rare and only successful when there\nwere identical elements in the situations or contexts. Less than\na decade later, educational psychologist Charles Judd challenged\nthese findings and showed that if the learner was capable of\nunderstandingtheabstractprincipleinformingtheproblemoridea,\nshe would be able to apply it in a different context even if all the\nsameelementswerenotpresent.Juddshowedthattransferwas,in\nfact,possibleinsituationsthatwerenotcharacterizedbyidentical\nelementsandthatthelearnerherselfwasanimportantcomponent\nin the process.\nWhile Judd showed that transfer was possible, he did not prove\nthat it was automatic; it is the automaticity of transfer that is too\noften assumed in the teaching of writing. There is simply no basis\nfor that assumption. Writing professors Anne Beaufort and\nElizabeth Wardle both found in their research that even when\nstudentsdescribedtheirfirst-yearwritingcoursesasvaluable,they\nwere largely unable to generalize its teachings and thus imagine\nhowthatwritingconnectedtoothercourses.Forexample,Wardle\nexplains that students \u201cdid not appear to make even near\nconnections of those skills, much less transfer those skills to very\ndifferent contexts\u2026 no students suggested they were being asked\ntowriteapersuasivepapertobeabletowritepersuasivelyinother\ncourses.\u201d\nAlthough Judd\u2019s experiments in 1908 indicated that transfer was\npossible, it would take nearly a century for those who teach and\nstudywritingtobeginthinkingaboutwhattodoaboutthis.Infact,\nit was less than a decade ago that these scholars regularly began\nasking questions such as: If transfer is possible, are there certain\nways we can teach writing to promote transfer?\nTheaffirmativeanswertothisquestionistheantidotetothisbad\n| 389 idea.

But\nwhatdoes\u201ctransfer\u201dactuallymean?Andwhyisitimportantforyou\nand your writing?\nLet\u2019s break it down: transfer is the ability to take knowledge and\npractices learned about writing in one context and repurpose or\nreframethatknowledgeandpracticetohelpyouinanothercontext.\nThiscanhappenatthesametime\u2014concurrently\u2014oritcanhappen\nin the future.\nSo, for example, you might have transferred writing knowledge\nand practices you learned in your high school English course (one\ncontext) to your college entrance exam (a new, different context).\nUnderstandingtransferanditsrelationshiptowritingisparticularly\nimportant in college. Why? For a couple reasons: first, writing is\narguably one of the most important practices to engage with and\nlearn more about in college, and second, so much of what we do\nnowadaysisdoneinthewrittenform.Youwillwriteinyourfuture\nwhetherit\u2019sinanothercollegeclass,foraco-curricularclub,fora\njob or your future career, or even for social media. In one way or\nThe Importance of Transfer in Your First Year Writing Course | 395 another,youwillwrite.But,likesomeuniquestylechoices,writing\ncanbemisunderstoodandmisconceptionsaboutitcanbeformed.\nAnd these misconceptions impact your ability to successfully and\neffectively transfer writing knowledge and practices forward.\nThe Importance of Transfer in First Year Writing\nFirst year writing tends to be one or two courses that you take\nduring your first or second semester as a first year student in\ncollege.Thegoalofanyfirstyearwritingcourseshouldbetoteach\nfor transfer; in other words, to teach you writing concepts,\nknowledge(s), and practices to carry forward and help you\nrepurposeorreframeotherwritingcontexts(basically,tohelpyou\nunderstandother\/futurewritingsituations).Doingsohelpsyouto\nbecome a more effective writer, able to assess a writing situation\nand understand what it\u2019s asking of you. First year writing, simply\nput, teaches you about writing and attempts to prepare you for\nin-school and out-of-school writing tasks. Thus, transfer is so\nimportantinfirstyearwritingbecauseit\u2019sattemptingtoteachyou\ntobeamoreeffectivewriterforyourfuture(andthisfuturecould\nbe the near future, as in another class, or the distant future, as in\nyour career).\nWhen we think of transfer, we hope it\u2019s successful or effective\nat moving writing practices forward. The example I gave in the\nintroduction of using knowledge and practices from your high\nschool English course to write your college entrance essay could\nbe an example of what\u2019s called \u201cpositive transfer\u201d and since you\nare reading this essay, chances are you effectively transferred that\nknowledge and practice from one context to another\u2014in other\nwords,youpositivelymovedknowledgeandpracticesforward.But\nthere can also be two less-positive types of transfer:\n1. Negative transfer, when the knowledge or practice used\nnegatively impacts your ability to effectively perform in the\n396 | The Importance of Transfer in Your First Year Writing Course new context (Perkins and Salomon). For example, if you\u2019ve been\nused to writing the 5-paragraph essay for most of your life, this\nis your default response to any and all academic writing\nsituations, so when your philosophy professor asks you to\nwrite a reflective letter, you write her a 5-paragraph essay\nwithout giving it much thought. You receive a C- on the\nassignment and are crushed and angry. You did what you\nalways have done; how could it be \u201cwrong?\u201d It\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d\nbecause the writing you provided doesn\u2019t match what the\nsituation asked of you. This is an example of negative transfer.\n2. Resistance transfer, when the writer\u2019s past experiences with\nwriting encourage a resistance to new learning often resulting\nin a roadblock (Robertson et al.; Yancey et al.). This roadblock\ncan manifest in many ways from general types of resistances to\nfear of failure\u2014different types of students harness the\nroadblock in different ways depending upon what their prior\nexperiences with writing looked like.\nYoumightfindyourselfinoneorbothofthesecategorieswithout\neven realizing it. So how can you build upon these and move\nforward? The first step is simple: acknowledge them. When you\nactively acknowledge something\u2014whether by saying it out loud in\na discussion or by writing about it in a reflection\u2014it becomes real\ninawaythatitwasnotbefore.Youacknowledgetheneedtolearn\nmore.Thenextstepsincludedevelopingthatlearningandfirstyear\nwriting can help you with that.\nOurlivesrevolvearoundwriting:writingforsocialmedia,writing\nfor school, writing for a job; in short, writing allows us to\ncommunicatewithanynumberofspecificaudiences.Andweknow\nfrom research that the ability to effectively respond to writing\nsituations determines success in college and beyond. In the next\nsections, we\u2019ll walk through some of the bigger misconceptions\nabout writing and how they encourage negative or resistance\ntransfer.We\u2019llalsolookathowtofliporrevisethemisconceptions\ninto\u201ctruths\u201daboutwriting\u2014certaintiesaboutwritingthathelpyou\nThe Importance of Transfer in Your First Year Writing Course | 397 further develop your ability as a writer so that you may be able to\nsuccessfully and effectively transfer.\nCommon Misconceptions about Writing and Their Revised\nTruths\nMuchlikeyourstyle,writingcangetabadrap,andthus,thereare\nsomecommonmisconceptionsaboutit.Thesemisconceptionscan\nhinder your ability as a writer to effectively respond to a writing\nsituation, and these misconceptions closely connect to your prior\nexperiences with writing: \u201cprior\u201d experiences are experiences or\nlearning(s) you\u2019ve had in the past that have helped shape your\nunderstanding and awareness on\/about a topic. And because\nmisconceptionsaresocloselyconnectedtoyourpriorexperiences\nwith writing, they can lead to negative and\/or resistance transfer\nbecause both impede your ability to learn.\nBelow, I outline three common misconceptions (there are, of\ncourse,manymoremisconceptionsaboutwriting,butthesearethe\nthree that come up the most in my own research on transfer and\nwith my first year students). Then, following each misconception,\nare what I call \u201c(revised) \u2018truths,\u2019\u201d or ways to push back on the\nmisconceptionsandbuilduponthem,allowingyoutheopportunity\nto more readily transfer.\nMisconception #1: Writing Is Natural\nBeforeyoubeginanywritingtask,whatdoyouthinkabout?What\ndoyouactuallydobeforeyoustartwriting?Howdoyouunderstand\nwhat\u2019s being asked of you as the writer?\nYou may be thinking: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really think about anything\u201d\nor \u201cHm. I don\u2019t actually do anything except just start writing\u201d and\nyouwouldn\u2019tbealoneintheseassumptions.Manystudentsbelieve\nthat their writing happens naturally or without a process (or as\nmany students have said: \u201cUnconsciously\u201d). In other words, a lot\nof students believe that they don\u2019t need to think about the writing\ntaskbeforetheyactuallybeginwritingit.Theybelievethatwriting\n398 | The Importance of Transfer in Your First Year Writing Course is a natural process. But recent research in composition studies,\nor the study of writing and the practices of it, argues that writing\nis not natural: \u201cIt\u2019s useful to remember that writing is not natural\nbecausewriterstendtojudgetheirwritingprocessestooharshly\u2014\ncomparingthemtotheeasewithwhichtheyusuallyspeak\u201d(Dryer\n29). Thus, if writing is not natural, then a writer must think about\ntheirwritingbeforebeginningtohelpthemunderstandwhat\u2019seven\nbeing asked of them and then how to effectively respond to the\nsituation. And, as I explain below, we know from years of research\nthat writing is a process. This process is non-linear and\ncomplicated. It looks different for everyone and to create an\neffective piece of writing, and as my mentor once taught me, you\nhave to trust that process. In other words, you have to follow that\nprocess all the way through from messy start to complex finish.\n(Revised) Truth #1: Writing Is a Process\nSince writing is not natural, this means you need to develop a\nprocessinwhichyourespondtothevariouswritingsituations.The\nprocessyoudevelophelpsyoufigureouthowtoframeorreframe\nvariouswritingtasks.Forexample,theprocessmightincludedoing\na quick audience profile (depending upon the audience), asking\nquestions about purpose, googling the conventions of the genre,\ndrafting the genre, and reflecting upon what worked and didn\u2019t\nwork. Everybody\u2019s writing process looks a little different because\nwe all have different writerly identities (who you are as a writer\nand how you understand how to be a writer); a writerly identity\nhelps make your writing yours, and it should transcend all writing\nsituations.Forexample,nomatterwhatgenreStephenKingwrites\nin,youalwaysknowit\u2019sStephenKingbecausehiswriterlyidentity\nincludes using a specific type of tone, phrasing, and other things\nthat are unique to him as a writer.\nWe know from decades\u2019 worth of research that writing is a\nprocess, and you have to learn to trust that process. This means\nThe Importance of Transfer in Your First Year Writing Course | 399 that you start to trust yourself as a writer. The process helps you\ntobetterunderstandwhat\u2019sbeingaskedofyouandhowyoumight\neffectively respond to that writing situation. Part of this includes\ndrafting\u2014from brainstorming ideas to generating rough, working\ndrafts to digging into who your audience is and what they\nexpect\u2014and often peer review or having your peers look over and\nreview your writing to help you figure out what to do in revision.\nMost writers\u2019 process(es) includes drafting, some form of peer\nreview, and editing. But really, your process is yours to figure out\nwhat works best for you.\nSo,whatdoesyourwritingprocesslooklike?Takeamomentand\ntry two things:\n1. Reflect back on a writing situation where you felt most proud\nof the writing. What did you do to create it? Why did that\nparticular piece of writing make you proud? What do you wish\nyou could have done differently and\/or changed?\n2. Draw out your writing process. Yes, literally draw it out. What\ndoes it look like for you to create a piece of writing that you\nare proud of? What do you need? What space are you in? Who\nhelps you? Respond to these questions by drawing them out so\nyou can visually see what your writing process looks like.\nFiguringoutwhatyourprocessisandwhatitlookslikehelpsyouto\nbecomeamoreeffectivewriter,andovertime,themoreyoubegin\ntotrustyourprocess,themoreyou\u2019llunderstandwhoyouareasa\nwriter(anddevelopyourwriterlyidentity).Then,it\u2019sthisprocess(or\nprocesses) that can transfer into other writing contexts, informing\nthem and helping you better understand how to approach them.\nMisconception #2: Writing Is One Size Fits All\nHow do you respond to a text message from your bestie? How do\nyoucomposeanInstagrampost?Howdoyoufigureoutwhatkind\n400 | The Importance of Transfer in Your First Year Writing Course ofcaptionandhashtagstouseforyourTikTokvideo?Howdoyou\nwrite a 1000- word essay?\nHigh school teaches you how to write in a specific genre: the\n5-paragraphessay(or5-paragraphtheme)becauseitcanbehelpful\nfor the type of writing that you do while in high school. However,\nthe 5-paragraph essay cannot be used as a blanket genre or a one\nsize fits all model. Why? Because not all writing situations are one\nandthesame.Allwritingsituationsasksomethingdifferentofyou.\nFor example, in the four questions above, each one has a different\npurpose,adifferentaudience,andadifferentgenre,whichmeansto\neffectivelyrespondtoeachone,youneedtounderstandwhateach\npurpose is, who your audience is, and what the genre conventions\nare.Thiscanbedifficultbecause\u201cpeopleactinmultiple,interacting\nsystemsofactivitywherewritingthatseemsthe\u2018same\u2019aswhatone\nhas read or written before is in practice very different\u2014and not\nonlyintheformalfeatures,the\u2018how\u2019ofwriting\u201d(RussellandYa\u00f1ez\n359).

And when something has worked well, it can be\ndifficulttobuilduponbecauseyouareunsureofhowtorevisethose\npractices.Todosorequiresanunderstandingthatthereismoreto\nlearn.\n(Revised) Truth #2: Purpose, Genre, and Audience Inform the\nWriting Situation\nAs the Russell and Ya\u00f1ez quote suggests, one of the biggest\nThe Importance of Transfer in Your First Year Writing Course | 401 problems with Misconception #2 is that it doesn\u2019t account for the\ndifferent specifics that make each writing situation its own. All\nwriting situations ask different things of you, the writer. An easy\nway to break it down is to ask yourself:\n\u2022 What is thepurposeof the writing situation? What is the\nsituation asking you specifically to do?\n\u2022 What is thegenre? And what are the specific conventions of\nthat genre (what makes an email different from a rhetorical\nanalysis and different from a text message?)?\n\u2022 Who is theaudience? What do you know about the audience?\nInshort,therearedifferenttypesofwritingsituationsandeachone\nhasaspecificpurposewithaspecificgenreandaspecificaudience.\nThese are considered \u201ckey terms\u201d or terms that help you better\ncomprehend how to respond to a writing situation. These terms\nalso start to give you a vocabulary to help you articulate an\nunderstandingofwriting.Researchfromwritingstudiesshowsthat\nwhen students don\u2019t have a vocabulary to explain their writing\npractices, they have a difficult time transferring knowledge or\npractices forward (Jarratt et al.). The vocabulary, or key terms,\nprovide you with a way to talk (and write) about writing.\nBuildingonthetwoactivitiesabove,takeaminutetorespondto\nthese questions:\n1.

These key terms become\npartofyourprocess;thus,byhavingasetofkeyterms,youcreatea\nframework that you can transfer forward.\nMisconception #3: There\u2019s Nothing More to Learn\nWhat classes were you most excited to take your first year in\ncollege? What classes were you dreading?\nYou might be thinking, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t exactly want to take first\nyear writing\u2026\u201d and many others would probably agree with you.\nEventhoughfirstyearwritingisaclassthatthemajorityofstudents\nacrossthecountry(nomattertheinstitutionthattheyareat)have\nto take, it is also one that many of students do not want to take.\nWhy? Because a lot of students believe that there\u2019s nothing more\nto learn with writing\u2014that the knowledge and practices learned\nduring their K-12 education is all they need to be successful and\neffective writers. Some also believe that every writing class and\nevery academic writing opportunity only presents them with the\nexact same type of material over and over again so that they are\nmerely relearning the same thing they learned previously.\nTheseperceptionsaboutwritingleadtosomeprettydeep-rooted\nemotional responses to first year writing courses, from anger to\nindifference to bitterness. As a result, out of these three\nmisconceptions about writing, this one is the hardest to work on\nand move past. Why? Because if you enter into a class believing\nyoudon\u2019thaveanythingtolearnoryou\u2019llonlybelearningthesame\nthingyoualreadyknow,you\u2019vealreadysetyourselfuptonotlearn\nanything. Belief is a very powerful tool, and the ways in which\nit\u2019s ingrained in prior experiences with writing affect the way a\nwriterrespondstoawritingtask.Forexample,andasmanywriting\nscholars have argued, if a writer approaches a writing situation as\nThe Importance of Transfer in Your First Year Writing Course | 403 \u201csomething they already know how to produce\u201d (i.e. a 5-paragraph\nessay)withoutgivingitmuchattentionorthought,thentheirprior\nexperiences have impacted their ability to truly look at and assess\nwhat the writing situation is asking of them and then they simply\nrespond with a 5-paragraph essay.\nPushing past and building onto these prior experiences can be\nincrediblydifficult,especiallyifthebeliefisalsoconnectedtovalue\n(i.e. grades). I\u2019ve seen students respond to a new writing situation\nlike, \u201cEh, whaddaya know? I\u2019ve gotten As up to this!
