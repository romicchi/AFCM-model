{"text":"Introduction\nReading about any culture foreign to one\u2019s own tends to create a form of culture shock in the reader. In a world\nliterature class, students frequently face texts that are completely unfamiliar to them, and the typical culture shock\nreactions set in. We tend not to like things that we do not understand, in part because we do not like the feeling of\nnot knowing something. I have had students complain that they did not \u201clike\u201d a story before we discussed it in class,\nand then the same students decide after the class discussion that they now like it. Again, understanding and liking\ngo hand in hand. Give the literature a chance; something that might not make sense at first may end up being one of\nyour favorite stories after finding a way to approach it.\nThat being said, whether students like a story is not the point of reading that text in a literature class. We read\nliterature in these classes to learn something. It is a nice addition to the experience if students like the works, but we\ncan read and analyze texts that we do not enjoy just as effectively as the ones we do: In some cases, it is actually easier.\nCritical thinking comes from taking something that is unfamiliar, breaking it down into manageable chunks of infor-\nmation, fitting it back together, and using the experience to replicate the process in other situations in the future.\nA literature class is, of course, a perfect place to learn critical thinking skills. When interpreting a text, pre-\ntend that you are a lawyer in a courtroom arguing a case. Not all cases have smoking guns; most are won or lost on\ncircumstantial evidence alone. The interpretation needs to be based primarily on evidence from the text; therefore,\nthere can be more than one possible approach, but some interpretations can be wrong if there is no support in the\ntext for the generalizations that the student uses. Evidence is the key; based on what the text tells us, what do we\nactually know? Expert opinions (secondary sources) may help, but remember that both sides in a court case usually\ncan call some expert who will agree with them. Authorial intention is not entirely out of bounds in such an argu-\nment, but it operates on the same principles: What can we actually argue, based on the evidence? For instance, any\nknowledge of Hemingway\u2019s personal history makes it unlikely that the story \u201cSoldier\u2019s Home\u201d could be interpreted\nas unsupportive of soldiers. Alternately, there are cases when the author\u2019s life is of little or no help. Faulkner refused\nto tell an interviewer what the meaning of \u201cA Rose for Emily\u201d was, preferring perhaps that the reader not be limited\nby a simple (or simplistic) explanation of meaning.\nIn every interpretation, remember to distinguish between the views of the original audience and the views of\nthe modern reader. While a text may remind students about their grandfathers, that association does not often help\nwhen interpreting a story written by someone years ago who did not know their grandfather. (It may, of course, help\nstudents interpret their interpretations, but, except for the very best reader response theorists out there, that approach\nis more commonly found in a different field of study.) If the story is about a grandfather in ancient Greece, the com-\nparison with their grandfather would be most useful if it helped focus them on what the characters in that time period\nin Greek society thought about grandfathers (or treated them, or talked to them, etc.) back then that is similar to or\ndifferent from modern expectations. In other words, what does the work tell us about the expectations of the original\naudience? Without at least a solid guess about what the original audience thought about the work, it is impossible to\ndiscuss whether the author is writing something that conforms to society\u2019s expectations or argues against them, let\nalone what the original audience was expected to learn from the story, or how it expected to be entertained.\nThe expectations of the audience bring us full circle to the issue of culture shock once again. Students in U.S.\nuniversities often feel more comfortable with American or British literature, since the K-12 school system in the\nU.S. usually emphasizes those works. Even if some students have not lived through the 1960s in the U.S., there is\nstill a sense of familiarity to students raised in the U.S., although they might not understand as much of the deeper\nsocial context as they think they do. A world literature class may be the first place that some students have encoun-\ntered European works, let alone non-Western texts. The emphasis in this anthology, therefore, is on non-Western\nand European works, with only the British authors who were the most influential to European and non-Western au-\nthors (such as Shakespeare, whose works have influenced authors around the world to the present day). In a world\nliterature class, there is no way that a student can be equally familiar with all of the societies, contexts, time periods,\ncultures, religions, and languages that they will encounter; even though the works presented here are translated,\ni Compact Anthology of World Literature\nstudents will face issues such as unfamiliar names and parts of the story (such as puns) that may not translate well\nor at all. Since these stories are rooted in their cultures and time periods, it is necessary to know the basic context of\neach work to understand the expectations of the original audience. The introductions in this anthology are meant\nto be just that: a basic overview of what students need to know before they begin reading, with topics that students\ncan research further. An open access literature textbook cannot be a history book at the same time, but history is\nthe great companion of literature: The more history students know, the easier it is for them to interpret literature.\nThese works can help students understand the present, as well. In an electronic age, with this text available to\nanyone with computer access around the world, it has never been more necessary to recognize and understand\ndifferences among nationalities and cultures. The literature in this anthology is foundational, in the sense that these\nworks influenced the authors who followed them. For Western literature, it is necessary to know something about\nthe Trojan War (and the Trojan Horse) to understand everything from literary references to them (for almost three\nthousand or so years) to why a computer virus would be named a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d because of what it does. In India,\nthe characters in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana still show up in regular conversations, and it would be im-\npossible to read modern Indian literature without a basic knowledge of these texts, which are referenced frequently.\nChinese literature is infused with Confucian concepts, which influenced Chinese culture for thousands of years.\nThese are just a few of the examples of why these texts are important to this day, and the introductions will explain\nthe influence of each work.\nA word to the instructor: The texts have been chosen with the idea that they can be compared and contrasted,\nusing common themes. Rather than numerous (and therefore often random) choices of texts from various periods,\nthese selected works are meant to make both teaching and learning easier. Students often learn better when there is\na theme or a set of themes that they can use to make sense of the stories. For example, the differences among cul-\ntures and time periods in the definition of a hero are found throughout the anthology. As the time periods progress,\nthe type of hero changes as well: warriors in the ancient world, knights and samurai in the medieval period, and\nsoldiers in works set in the Renaissance. Many of the works examine the role of women in society, and each time\nperiod contains numerous works of social commentary. There are epics across world literature to compare, belief\nsystems from the Greek pantheon of gods to Native American origin stories, and philosophical questions about\nethical and moral behavior.\nIt is by comparing similar topics and themes that students are most easily able to see the significant differences in\nthe cultures. If I ask students to discuss a work such as the Analects of Confucius, they often do not know where to\nbegin or what to say. If I ask students to suggest what would happen if Gilgamesh were dropped into the environment\nof the Analects, they immediately see the problems: Gilgamesh is not a \u201cgentleman\u201d by Confucian standards, nor does\nhe have the temperament to attract gentlemen retainers, who would expect courteous and proper behavior from him.\nWhile cultural expectations are not universal, many of the themes found in these works are. Human beings\nhave always cared about friendship, love, and finding their place in the world; we still read and watch stories of\nheroic journeys, bravery in its many forms, family relationships (good and bad), and the triumphs and tragedies of\npeople who are not so different from ourselves.\nAs an example, the following assignment is one possible way to compare the texts in the Ancient World section.\nCulture Shock Essay: take a character such as Achilles and place him in a story with a culture that would be\ncompletely foreign to him (such as the Mahabharata). How would he react to the people around him, and\nwhat would they think about him\/his behavior? This topic could be mixed and matched: Hector in Gil-\ngamesh, Arjuna in the Aeneid, Aeneas in the Art of War, etc.\nAgain, by asking the students to compare cultures, it is easier for them to identify differences. Obviously, a\nsimilar type of essay would work in the medieval period and the Renaissance, and Ancient World texts could be\ncompared to medieval or Renaissance texts as the term progresses.\nA note about calendar systems: The anthology uses B.C.E. (Before Common Era) and C.E. (Common Era).\nAs a world literature text, it seeks to be as inclusive as possible of belief systems around the world. Of course, the\nnumbering system used comes from the Christian calendar\u2019s B.C. (Before Christ) and A.D. (Anno Domini\u2014in the\nyear of our Lord); basically, Christianity is the determiner of what is Common Era and before. Since there needs to\nbe a way of comparing time periods across these cultures, and today\u2019s world uses the numbering system that stems\nfrom the Christian calendar, it is the system used throughout. It would be too unwieldy to use all of the relevant\ncalendar systems, although it is worth noting to students that they exist. For instance, 2015 C.E. is the year 5776 in\nthe Hebrew calendar, the year 4713 in the Chinese calendar, and 1436 in the Islamic calendar. For Hinduism, the\ncurrent Epoch of this cycle of the universe (which is destroyed and remade numerous times) started in 3012 B.C.E.,\nand the current Era in that Epoch started in 78 C.E. Obviously, it would be both difficult and confusing to employ\nmore than one system.\nii P a r t O n e\nAncient World\niii Compact Anthology of World Literature\nMany of these ancient world texts concern themselves with the definition of a hero, as well as the (often sepa-\nrate) definition of a leader: A leader can be a hero, but a hero is not always a leader. Love for one\u2019s family drives the\nactions of the majority of the characters in this section; romantic love has its place in the stories as well, although\nit is discussed less. Both societal and religious expectations play key roles in the behavior of these characters, so it\nwill be necessary to understand a few details about those beliefs. The chapter introductions will address some basic\nreligious beliefs for each region.\nAs with all the time periods in world literature, different events mark the end of the ancient world in different\ncultures. If the fall of Rome in 476 C.E. marks the end of an era in Europe, it is clearly an irrelevant date to cultures\nsuch as China and India. The unification of China under the Qin dynasty in 221 B.C.E. marks the end of Ancient\nChina and the beginning of the Dynastic Period. Classical India ends somewhere between 550 C.E. (with the fall\nof the Gupta Empire) and 1206 C.E. (with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate following hundreds of years of\nIslamic invasions).\nWhile poetry is found in all of the ancient cultures included, a commonality across most of those cultures is\nepic poetry. Epic heroes often have some kind of supernatural ability, or are demigods, and\/or have the help of the\ngods. In Gilgamesh, the title character is two-thirds god and one-third human (an interesting exercise for a mod-\nern-day geneticist), while Achilles is the son of a goddess and a mortal man in the Iliad, as is Aeneas in the Aeneid.\nIf Odysseus is not a demigod, he certainly is loved by the goddess Athena, who protects him through his journeys.\nIn the Mahabharata, the main warriors of the story are all demigods, and in the Ramayana, the main character is a\ngod: an avatar of the god Vishnu, sent down to earth in human form to fight evil. The Metamorphoses is the anti-ep-\nic of the group, arguing that there are no real heroes: just gods and humans who make mistakes, forming history\nalong the way.\nMany of the works in this section have another commonality: They are foundational texts for their respective\nsocieties. Western literature would not exist in its present form without the influence of Greek and Roman epics\nor ancient Greek drama. References to the Trojan War, to Ovid, and to Oedipus (among many others) are found in\nmedia from literature (in the Middle Ages to the present day) to newspaper comic strips. Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War\nis still taught around the world. In present-day India, the characters in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana are ref-\nerenced in everyday conversations. Confucian ethics influenced Chinese thought for well over two thousand years.\nFor Students:\nThe works in this section are meant to be compared and contrasted. Consider the following questions while reading:\n\u2022 Compare the definition of a hero in Gilgamesh, the Iliad, the Mahabharata, and the Aeneid. What does a\nhero have to do to be admired by his own society? What can\u2019t he do?\n\u2022 How are Gilgamesh and Achilles similar? How is Hector both similar and different to them?\n\u2022 How are the expectations for a gentleman in the Analects similar to the expectations for the sons of Pandu\nin the Mahabharata? What makes Aeneas both similar and different to them?\n\u2022 What view of the gods do the characters have? What does their pantheon of gods expect from the charac-\nters, and what do they expect of the gods?\n\u2022 How do characters in this section deal with authority\/authority figures? Why?\nWritten by Laura J. Getty\niv 1\nMiddle East, Near East, Greece\nThe texts chosen for this chapter were influential in their own times and beyond. Gilgamesh was an ancient\nSumerian king whose story was valued and retold by other cultures who invaded the area. The Bible remains one\nof the most widely read books in history. Homer\u2019s epics form a cornerstone of western literature, and the two plays\nselected from ancient Greek drama influenced countless writers after them. Only the plays were originally written\nworks; the other texts were part of an oral tradition before they were written down. Even then, the subject matter of\nthe plays is not original to the authors: The audience knew the stories of Oedipus and Medea already. Homer was\nnot the first (or the last) to compose poems on the Trojan War and its aftermath. Originality was not particularly\nprized in an oral culture, where only the best works were worth memorizing. Homer\u2019s fame comes from how well\nhe tells his version of events.\nWhen reading the selected texts, remember that the contemporary definition of a hero or leader is often not\ncompatible with the ancient world\u2019s definition of a hero or leader. Each society, and sometimes each time period in\neach society, can have a different definition, based on what the expectations were. There is also a difference between\nthe modern idea of an action hero and the ancient world\u2019s definition of an epic hero. To be the hero of an epic, the\ncharacter needs to meet at least some of the following requirements: He receives divine intervention (or is chosen\nby the gods to win), has superhuman strength or abilities, is of national or international importance, has the ability\nto overcome and learn from a personal flaw, and goes on a significant journey. The ultimate goal of epic heroes is to\nbe remembered: achieving immortality through their deeds, which will live on in stories.

Some of the epic heroes in this chapter\nfight to protect others, but many fight for personal glory,\nregardless of the collateral damage. In other words, an\nepic hero is an ideal warrior in his society, but not always\nan ideal human being. In the Iliad, Achilles is the greatest\nwarrior among the Greeks, and his main concern is making\na name for himself that will last forever. When he is insult-\ned by Agamemnon, therefore, he asks that Zeus punish\nAchilles\u2019 own side, slaughtering the Greeks until they beg\nhim for forgiveness. Achilles fights for his own glory, not\nthe glory of others.\nIn Gilgamesh, the title character begins the story as an\nimpressive epic hero, but a poor leader (as the gods them- Image 1.5: Uruk in 2008 | An aerial view of the dig site at\nWarka in Iraq.\nselves indicate in the story when they respond to the\nprayers of the citizens of Uruk, who are begging the gods to\nAuthor: SAC Andy Holmes (RAF)\nprotect them from their own king). Gilgamesh\u2019s lack of\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nmorality stems in part from his demigod status; as the License: Open Government License (OGL)\nancient Sumerians recognized, their pantheon of gods was\nnot particularly moral. Since epic heroes need the help of the gods to win, the focus is not on individual strength,\nbut on gaining the favor of the gods. Yes, Gilgamesh is strong, but to fight the supernatural creature Humbaba,\nGilgamesh needs help: his mother\u2019s prayers to the gods, his friend Enkidu\u2019s support, supernatural weapons from the\ngod Shamash (namely the winds), and his tears as offerings to Shamash in exchange for his help. The expectations\nfor a good king are clear in the text, but they conflict on\nsome level with the expectations for an epic hero in this\ncase.\nThe hero who receives divine intervention is the one\nwho wins every time, so being humble to the gods is vital\nfor success. When Brad Pitt plays Achilles in the movie\nTroy, there are no toddler tantrums; in the Iliad, Achilles\nImage 1.2: City of Uruk | A basic map of Uruk with notes on the city\u2019s boundaries. cries every time he wants the help of his mother, the god-\ndess Thetis.

The original audience, how-\never, would be familiar with example after example of how\npointless it is to try to win without the help of the gods: No\nmatter who would have won based on his own strength,\nthe gods determine the final result. Human strength means\nlittle in such a universe.\nEqually pointless is the attempt to change fate, which is\nthe one force in the Greek stories that is stronger than the\ngods.

The entire book is some-\ntimes called the Torah, and it is also the Christian Old Testament. The section called the Torah, which is comprised\nof the first five books (also called the Pentateuch and the Five Books of Moses), were originally believed to have been\ncomposed in the 14th century B.C.E. by Moses. According to biblical scholars, the version that we have today is a\ncompilation from four different written traditions after the time of Moses, which explains why the text has multi-\nple inconsistencies: For instance, in \u201cGenesis,\u201d there are two creations of humans, and the number of animals that\nGod tells Noah to take into the ark changes from two of each kind to seven of each kind. These versions are called\nthe J, E, D, and P texts, which were combined over time. The Hebrew Bible has been translated many times over the\ncenturies, and two of the most popular translations are included in the anthology for comparison.\nWritten by Laura J.

And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\n3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God\ndivided the light from the darkness. 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the eve-\nning and the morning were the first day.\n6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\n7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which\nwere above the firmament: and it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morn-\ning were the second day.\n9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land\nappear: and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas:\nand God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit\ntree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth\ngrass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and\nGod saw that it was good. 13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.\n14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let\nthem be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the\nheaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,\nand the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to\ngive light upon the earth, 18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness:\nand God saw that it was good. 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\n20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly\nabove the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that\nmoveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God\nsaw that it was good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and\nlet fowl multiply in the earth. 23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\n4 Hebrew Bible\n24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast\nof the earth after his kind: and it was so. 25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their\nkind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.\n26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish\nof the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that\ncreepeth upon the earth. 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and\nfemale created he them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish\nthe earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every\nliving thing that moveth upon the earth.\n29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and\nevery tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. 30 And to every beast of the\nearth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given\nevery green herb for meat: and it was so. 31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very\ngood. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\nGenesis Chapter 2\n1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 2 And on the seventh day God ended\nhis work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 3 And God\nblessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and\nmade.\n4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD\nGod made the earth and the heavens, 5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the\nfield before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the\nground. 6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 7 And the LORD God\nformed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living\nsoul.\n8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.\n9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food;\nthe tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 10 And a river went out\nof Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 11 The name of the first\nis Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 12 And the gold of that land is\ngood: there is bdellium and the onyx stone. 13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that com-\npasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. 14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the\neast of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden\nof Eden to dress it and to keep it.\n16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 17 But of\nthe tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt\nsurely die.\n18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.\n19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought\nthem unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the\nname thereof. 20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for\nAdam there was not found an help meet for him.\n21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and\nclosed up the flesh instead thereof; 22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman,\nand brought her unto the man. 23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be\ncalled Woman, because she was taken out of Man. 24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall\ncleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not\nashamed.\nGenesis Chapter 3\n1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said\nunto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 2 And the woman said unto the\nserpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the\ngarden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 4 And the serpent said unto the\nwoman, Ye shall not surely die: 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened,\n5 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nand ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\n6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be\ndesired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and\nhe did eat. 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves\ntogether, and made themselves aprons. 8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the\ncool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of\nthe garden.\n9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? 10 And he said, I heard thy voice\nin the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\n11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee\nthat thou shouldest not eat? 12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the\ntree, and I did eat. 13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman\nsaid, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\n14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and\nabove every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 15 And I\nwill put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou\nshalt bruise his heel. 16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow\nthou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\n17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of\nwhich I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat\nof it all the days of thy life; 18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the\nfield; 19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken:\nfor dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. 20 And Adam called his wife\u2019s name Eve; because she was the\nmother of all living. 21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.\n22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he\nput forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 23 Therefore the LORD God sent him\nforth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 24 So he drove out the man; and he\nplaced at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way\nof the tree of life.\nGenesis Chapter 4\n1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the\nLORD. 2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\n3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the\nLORD. 4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect\nunto Abel and to his offering: 5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and\nhis countenance fell.\n6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 7 If thou doest well,\nshalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and\nthou shalt rule over him. 8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field,\nthat Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.\n9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother\u2019s keep-\ner? 10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother\u2019s blood crieth unto me from the ground. 11 And\nnow art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother\u2019s blood from thy hand;\n12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt\nthou be in the earth.\n13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear. 14 Behold, thou hast driven me\nout this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in\nthe earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. 15 And the LORD said unto him,\nTherefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon\nCain, lest any finding him should kill him.\n16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 17 And\nCain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after\nthe name of his son, Enoch. 18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methu-\nsael: and Methusael begat Lamech.\n19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.\n6 Hebrew Bible\n20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle. 21 And his brother\u2019s\nname was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ. 22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain,\nan instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.\n23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my\nspeech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. 24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,\ntruly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.\n25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath ap-\npointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he\ncalled his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.\nGenesis Chapter 5\n1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he\nhim; 2 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were\ncreated.\n3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and\ncalled his name Seth: 4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat\nsons and daughters: 5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.\n6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 7 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred\nand seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and\nhe died.\n9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 10 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fif-\nteen years, and begat sons and daughters: 11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.\n12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 13 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight\nhundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: 14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten\nyears: and he died.\n15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight\nhundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters: 17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred nine-\nty and five years: and he died.\n18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: 19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch\neight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two\nyears: and he died.\n21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 22 And Enoch walked with God after he begat\nMethuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred\nsixty and five years: 24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.\n25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech. 26 And Methuselah lived after\nhe begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: 27 And all the days of Methu-\nselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.\n28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 29 And he called his name Noah, saying,\nThis same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath\ncursed. 30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:\n31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died. 32 And Noah was five hun-\ndred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\nGenesis Chapter 6\n1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto\nthem, 2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which\nthey chose. 3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days\nshall be an hundred and twenty years.\n4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the\ndaughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of re-\nnown.\n5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of\nhis heart was only evil continually.\n6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 7 And the\nLORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creep-\ning thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.\n7 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.\n9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with\nGod. 10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12 And God looked upon the\nearth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.\n13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through\nthem; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.\n14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without\nwith pitch. 15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred\ncubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in\na cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and\nthird stories shalt thou make it. 17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all\nflesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die. 18 But with thee\nwill I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons\u2019 wives\nwith thee. 19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive\nwith thee; they shall be male and female. 20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping\nthing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. 21 And take thou unto\nthee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 22 Thus\ndid Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.\nGenesis Chapter 7\n1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous\nbefore me in this generation. 2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and\nof beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. 3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the fe-\nmale; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth\nforty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.\n5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. 6 And Noah was six hundred years old\nwhen the flood of waters was upon the earth.\n7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons\u2019 wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters\nof the flood. 8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon\nthe earth, 9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded\nNoah. 10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.\n11 In the six hundredth year of Noah\u2019s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day\nwere all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. 12 And the rain was\nupon the earth forty days and forty nights.\n13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah\u2019s wife, and\nthe three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after\ntheir kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every\nbird of every sort. 15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.\n16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut\nhim in.\n17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up\nabove the earth. 18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the\nface of the waters. 19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the\nwhole heaven, were covered. 20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.\n21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping\nthing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in\nthe dry land, died. 23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man,\nand cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah\nonly remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. 24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred\nand fifty days.\nGenesis Chapter 8\n1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God\nmade a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; 2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of\n8 Hebrew Bible\nheaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 3 And the waters returned from off the earth contin-\nually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.\n4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.\n5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month,\nwere the tops of the mountains seen.\n6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:\n7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8 Also\nhe sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 9 But the dove found\nno rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole\nearth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. 10 And he stayed yet other\nseven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo,\nin her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 12 And he\nstayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.\n13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the\nwaters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the\nface of the ground was dry. 14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth\ndried.\n15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons\u2019\nwives with thee. 17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle,\nand of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruit-\nful, and multiply upon the earth. 18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons\u2019 wives with him:\n19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went\nforth out of the ark.\n20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and\noffered burnt offerings on the altar. 21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I\nwill not again curse the ground any more for man\u2019s sake; for the imagination of man\u2019s heart is evil from his youth;\nneither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. 22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and\nharvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\nGenesis Chapter 9\n1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\n2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air,\nupon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. 3 Every\nmoving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 4 But flesh with\nthe life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at\nthe hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man\u2019s brother will I require the\nlife of man. 6 Whoso sheddeth man\u2019s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.\n7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.\n8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with\nyou, and with your seed after you; 10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of\nevery beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 11 And I will establish\nmy covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any\nmore be a flood to destroy the earth.\n12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature\nthat is with you, for perpetual generations: 13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant\nbetween me and the earth. 14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be\nseen in the cloud: 15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature\nof all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 And the bow shall be in the cloud;\nand I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all\nflesh that is upon the earth. 17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established\nbetween me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\nExodus Chapter 1\n1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came\nwith Jacob. 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and\nAsher. 5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.\n9 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.\n7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding\nmighty; and the land was filled with them.\n8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. 9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the\npeople of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: 10 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they\nmultiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against\nus, and so get them up out of the land. 11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their\nburdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. 12 But the more they afflicted them, the\nmore they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. 13 And the Egyptians made\nthe children of Israel to serve with rigour: 14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in\nbrick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.\n15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the\nname of the other Puah: 16 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them\nupon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. 17 But the midwives\nfeared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. 18 And the king of\nEgypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children\nalive? 19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they\nare lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. 20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives:\nand the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he\nmade them houses. 22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river,\nand every daughter ye shall save alive.\nExodus Chapter 2\n1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. 2 And the woman conceived,\nand bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. 3 And when she could\nnot longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the\nchild therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river\u2019s brink. 4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be\ndone to him.\n5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the\nriver\u2019s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 6 And when she had opened\nit, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the\nHebrews\u2019 children. 7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew\nwomen, that she may nurse the child for thee? 8 And Pharaoh\u2019s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and\ncalled the child\u2019s mother. 9 And Pharaoh\u2019s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I\nwill give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it. 10 And the child grew, and she brought him\nunto Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him\nout of the water.\n11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on\ntheir burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 12 And he looked this way and that\nway, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 13 And when he went\nout the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Where-\nfore smitest thou thy fellow? 14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me,\nas thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. 15 Now when Pharaoh heard\nthis thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and\nhe sat down by a well.\n16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water\ntheir father\u2019s flock. 17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and\nwatered their flock. 18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?\n19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and\nwatered the flock. 20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him,\nthat he may eat bread. 21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.\n22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.\n23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason\nof the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 24 And God heard their\ngroaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 25 And God looked upon\nthe children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.\n10 Hebrew Bible\nExodus Chapter 3\n1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside\nof the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. 2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in\na flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was\nnot consumed. 3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. 4 And\nwhen the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses,\nMoses. And he said, Here am I. 5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place\nwhereon thou standest is holy ground. 6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the\nGod of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.\n7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their\ncry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 8 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand\nof the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk\nand honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites,\nand the Jebusites. 9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the\noppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. 10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that\nthou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.\n11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the\nchildren of Israel out of Egypt? 12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that\nI have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.\n13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of\nyour fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? 14 And\nGod said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath\nsent me unto you. 15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD\nGod of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my\nname for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.\n16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of\nAbraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to\nyou in Egypt: 17 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,\nand the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with\nmilk and honey. 18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the\nking of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we\nbeseech thee, three days\u2019 journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.\n19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. 20 And I will stretch out\nmy hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.\n21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall\nnot go empty. 22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of\nsilver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall\nspoil the Egyptians.\nExodus Chapter 4\n1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will\nsay, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee. 2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he\nsaid, A rod. 3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Mo-\nses fled from before it. 4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put\nforth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: 5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their\nfathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.\n6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into\nhis bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow. 7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy\nbosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned\nagain as his other flesh. 8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the\nfirst sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also\nthese two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the\ndry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.\n10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast\nspoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. 11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath\n11 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nmade man\u2019s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD? 12 Now\ntherefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. 13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I\npray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. 14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and\nhe said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to\nmeet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. 15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in\nhis mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. 16 And he shall\nbe thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to\nhim instead of God. 17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.\n18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and\nreturn unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in\npeace. 19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought\nthy life. 20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt:\nand Moses took the rod of God in his hand. 21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into\nEgypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his\nheart, that he shall not let the people go. 22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son,\neven my firstborn: 23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go,\nbehold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.\n24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him. 25 Then Zipporah\ntook a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art\nthou to me. 26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.\n27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the\nmount of God, and kissed him. 28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the\nsigns which he had commanded him.\n29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: 30 And Aaron spake\nall the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. 31 And the peo-\nple believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon\ntheir affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.\nExodus Chapter 5\n1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my peo-\nple go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. 2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should\nobey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.\n3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days\u2019 journey into the\ndesert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. 4 And the king\nof Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your\nburdens. 5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their bur-\ndens. 6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, 7 Ye shall no\nmore give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 8 And the tale\nof the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they\nbe idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. 9 Let there more work be laid upon the men,\nthat they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.\n10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus\nsaith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. 11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall\nbe diminished. 12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead\nof straw. 13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.\n14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh\u2019s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and de-\nmanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?\n15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus\nwith thy servants?\n16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are\nbeaten; but the fault is in thine own people. 17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do\nsacrifice to the LORD. 18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the\ntale of bricks. 19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall\nnot minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.\n20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 21 And they said\nunto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of\n12 Hebrew Bible\nPharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. 22 And Moses returned unto the\nLORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? 23 For\nsince I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy peo-\nple at all.\nExodus Chapter 6\n1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall\nhe let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. 2 And God spake unto Moses, and\nsaid unto him, I am the LORD: 3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God\nAlmighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. 4 And I have also established my covenant with\nthem, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. 5 And I have also\nheard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my cov-\nenant. 6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens\nof the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with\ngreat judgments: 7 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am\nthe LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 8 And I will bring you in\nunto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you\nfor an heritage: I am the LORD.\n9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and\nfor cruel bondage.\n10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 11 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the chil-\ndren of Israel go out of his land. 12 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have\nnot hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? 13 And the LORD spake\nunto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to\nbring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.\n14 These be the heads of their fathers\u2019 houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu,\nHezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben. 15 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and\nJachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.\n16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari:\nand the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years. 17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi,\naccording to their families. 18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of\nthe life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years. 19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are\nthe families of Levi according to their generations. 20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father\u2019s sister to wife; and\nshe bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.\n21 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 22 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan,\nand Zithri. 23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him\nNadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 24 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the\nfamilies of the Korhites. 25 And Eleazar Aaron\u2019s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare\nhim Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families. 26 These are that Aaron\nand Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their\narmies. 27 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these\nare that Moses and Aaron.\n28 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, 29 That the LORD\nspake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. 30 And\nMoses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?\nExodus Chapter 7\n1 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy\nprophet. 2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send\nthe children of Israel out of his land. 3 And I will harden Pharaoh\u2019s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in\nthe land of Egypt. 4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth\nmine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 5 And the Egyptians\nshall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel\nfrom among them. 6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they. 7 And Moses was four-\nscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.\n8 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 9 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew\n13 Compact Anthology of World Literature\na miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a\nserpent.\n10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast\ndown his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise\nmen and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. 12 For\nthey cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron\u2019s rod swallowed up their rods. 13 And he\nhardened Pharaoh\u2019s heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.\n14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh\u2019s heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. 15 Get thee unto\nPharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river\u2019s brink against he come;\nand the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. 16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD\nGod of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness:\nand, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. 17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:\nbehold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be\nturned to blood. 18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to\ndrink of the water of the river.\n19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters\nof Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they\nmay become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in\nvessels of stone. 20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the\nwaters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were\nin the river were turned to blood. 21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians\ncould not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 22 And the magicians\nof Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh\u2019s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as\nthe LORD had said. 23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also. 24 And\nall the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.\n25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.\nExodus Chapter 8\n1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people\ngo, that they may serve me. 2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: 3 And\nthe river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedcham-\nber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy\nkneadingtroughs: 4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.\n5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams,\nover the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. 6 And Aaron stretched out\nhis hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 7 And the magicians did so\nwith their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.\n8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from\nme, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD. 9 And Moses said\nunto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the\nfrogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only? 10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be\nit according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God. 11 And the frogs\nshall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the\nriver only. 12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs\nwhich he had brought against Pharaoh. 13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died\nout of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. 14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the\nland stank. 15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as\nthe LORD had said.\n16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it\nmay become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his\nrod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice\nthroughout all the land of Egypt. 18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they\ncould not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. 19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger\nof God: and Pharaoh\u2019s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.\n20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth\nto the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 21 Else, if thou wilt\n14 Hebrew Bible\nnot let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,\nand into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon\nthey are. 22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall\nbe there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. 23 And I will put a division be-\ntween my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be. 24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous\nswarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants\u2019 houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was\ncorrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.\n25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. 26 And Moses\nsaid, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall\nwe sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? 27 We will go three days\u2019\njourney into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us. 28 And Pharaoh said, I\nwill let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: in-\ntreat for me. 29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may\ndepart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any\nmore in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. 30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the\nLORD. 31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh,\nfrom his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. 32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time\nalso, neither would he let the people go.\nExodus Chapter 9\n1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the He-\nbrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 3 Be-\nhold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the cam-\nels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain. 4 And the LORD shall sever between\nthe cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children\u2019s of Israel. 5 And the\nLORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land. 6 And the LORD did that\nthing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. 7 And\nPharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hard-\nened, and he did not let the people go.\n8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses\nsprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. 9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and\nshall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. 10 And they\ntook ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil\nbreaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. 11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because\nof the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. 12 And the LORD hardened the heart\nof Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.\n13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him,\nThus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 14 For I will at this time send\nall my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there\nis none like me in all the earth. 15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with\npestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. 16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to\nshew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. 17 As yet exaltest thou thyself\nagainst my people, that thou wilt not let them go? 18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very\ngrievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now. 19 Send therefore now,\nand gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the\nfield, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. 20 He that feared the\nword of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 21 And he\nthat regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.\n22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the\nland of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. 23 And\nMoses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon\nthe ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. 24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail,\nvery grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 25 And the hail smote\nthroughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the\nfield, and brake every tree of the field. 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no\nhail.\n15 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD\nis righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty\nthunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. 29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I\nam gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall\nthere be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD\u2019s. 30 But as for thee and thy servants,\nI know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. 31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the\near, and the flax was bolled. 32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up. 33 And Moses\nwent out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased,\nand the rain was not poured upon the earth. 34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders\nwere ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hard-\nened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.\nExodus Chapter 10\n1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his\nservants, that I might shew these my signs before him: 2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy\nson\u2019s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know\nhow that I am the LORD. 3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD\nGod of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve\nme. 4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast: 5 And they\nshall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which\nis escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:\n6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither\nthy fathers, nor thy fathers\u2019 fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he\nturned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. 7 And Pharaoh\u2019s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a\nsnare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is de-\nstroyed? 8 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD\nyour God: but who are they that shall go? 9 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with\nour sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the\nLORD. 10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it;\nfor evil is before you. 11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were\ndriven out from Pharaoh\u2019s presence.\n12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they\nmay come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left. 13 And Moses\nstretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and\nall that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 14 And the locust went up over all the\nland of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such lo-\ncusts as they, neither after them shall be such. 15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was\ndarkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there\nremained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.\n16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God,\nand against you. 17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that\nhe may take away from me this death only. 18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 19 And the\nLORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there re-\nmained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. 20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh\u2019s heart, so that he would not let\nthe children of Israel go.\n21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the\nland of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt. 22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there\nwas a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place\nfor three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\n24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be\nstayed: let your little ones also go with you. 25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings,\nthat we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God. 26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left be-\nhind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD,\nuntil we come thither.\n27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh\u2019s heart, and he would not let them go. 28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get\nthee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die. 29 And\n16 Hebrew Bible\nMoses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.\nExodus Chapter 11\n1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards\nhe will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. 2 Speak now in the\nears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver\nand jewels of gold. 3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses\nwas very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh\u2019s servants, and in the sight of the people.\n4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: 5 And all the\nfirstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the\nfirstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts. 6 And there shall be a great cry\nthroughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. 7 But against any of\nthe children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD\ndoth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. 8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and\nbow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out.\nAnd he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. 9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto\nyou; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before\nPharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh\u2019s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.\nExodus Chapter 12\n1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying,\n2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.\n3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them\nevery man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 4 And if the household be too little\nfor the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man\naccording to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. 5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first\nyear: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the\nsame month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. 7 And they shall take\nof the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.\n8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat\nit. 9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance\nthereof. 10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning\nye shall burn with fire.\n11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and\nye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD\u2019s passover. 12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will\nsmite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute\njudgment: I am the LORD. 13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I\nsee the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of\nEgypt. 14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your\ngenerations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. 15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the\nfirst day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until\nthe seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and\nin the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that\nwhich every man must eat, that only may be done of you. 17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for\nin this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your\ngenerations by an ordinance for ever.\n18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one\nand twentieth day of the month at even. 19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever\neateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a strang-\ner, or born in the land. 20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.\n21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according\nto your families, and kill the passover. 22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the\nbason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out\nat the door of his house until the morning. 23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when\nhe seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer\nthe destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. 24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee\n17 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nand to thy sons for ever. 25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you,\naccording as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. 26 And it shall come to pass, when your children\nshall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? 27 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD\u2019s passover, who\npassed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses.\nAnd the people bowed the head and worshipped. 28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had\ncommanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.\n29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the first-\nborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-\nborn of cattle. 30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a\ngreat cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.\n31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people,\nboth ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. 32 Also take your flocks and your herds,\nas ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also. 33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might\nsend them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. 34 And the people took their dough before it\nwas leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. 35 And the children of\nIsrael did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,\nand raiment: 36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such\nthings as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.\n37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were\nmen, beside children. 38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cat-\ntle. 39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened;\nbecause they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.\n40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. 41 And it\ncame to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts\nof the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. 42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing\nthem out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their\ngenerations.\n43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger\neat thereof: 44 But every man\u2019s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat\nthereof. 45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. 46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not\ncarry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. 47 All the congregation\nof Israel shall keep it. 48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all\nhis males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for\nno uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. 49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that\nsojourneth among you. 50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did\nthey. 51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt\nby their armies.\nExodus Chapter 13\n1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb\namong the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.\n3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of\nbondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.\n4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.\n5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the\nAmorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk\nand honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. 6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the\nseventh day shall be a feast to the LORD. 7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened\nbread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.\n8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me\nwhen I came forth out of Egypt. 9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between\nthine eyes, that the LORD\u2019s law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of\nEgypt. 10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.\n11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to\nthy fathers, and shall give it thee, 12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every\nfirstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the LORD\u2019s. 13 And every firstling of an ass thou\n18 Hebrew Bible\nshalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man\namong thy children shalt thou redeem.\n14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him,\nBy strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: 15 And it came to pass, when\nPharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man,\nand the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the\nfirstborn of my children I redeem. 16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine\neyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.\n17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land\nof the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and\nthey return to Egypt: 18 But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the\nchildren of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt. 19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for\nhe had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away\nhence with you.\n20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 21 And the\nLORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give\nthem light; to go by day and night: 22 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night,\nfrom before the people.\nExodus Chapter 14\n1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp\nbefore Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. 3 For\nPharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. 4 And I\nwill harden Pharaoh\u2019s heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his\nhost; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.\n5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned\nagainst the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? 6 And he made\nready his chariot, and took his people with him: 7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots\nof Egypt, and captains over every one of them. 8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and\nhe pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand. 9 But the Egyptians\npursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them\nencamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.\n10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched\nafter them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. 11 And they said unto Mo-\nses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou\ndealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? 12 Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us\nalone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die\nin the wilderness.\n13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will\nshew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. 14 The\nLORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.\n15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they\ngo forward: 16 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of\nIsrael shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. 17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyp-\ntians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots,\nand upon his horsemen. 18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon\nPharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.\n19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar\nof the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: 20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians\nand the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one\ncame not near the other all the night.\n21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east\nwind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 22 And the children of Israel went into\nthe midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their\nleft.\n23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh\u2019s horses, his\n19 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nchariots, and his horsemen. 24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the\nEgyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 25 And took off their\nchariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the\nLORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.\n26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon\nthe Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. 27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea,\nand the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD\noverthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the\nhorsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of\nthem. 29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto\nthem on their right hand, and on their left. 30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians;\nand Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. 31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon\nthe Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.\nExodus Chapter 15\n1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the\nLORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 2 The LORD is my\nstrength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father\u2019s\nGod, and I will exalt him. 3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name. 4 Pharaoh\u2019s chariots and his host\nhath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea. 5 The depths have covered them: they\nsank into the bottom as a stone. 6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD,\nhath dashed in pieces the enemy. 7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up\nagainst thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble. 8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the\nwaters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of\nthe sea. 9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I\nwill draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. 10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank\nas lead in the mighty waters. 11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holi-\nness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? 12 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. 13 Thou in\nthy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy\nhabitation. 14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. 15 Then the\ndukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants\nof Canaan shall melt away. 16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still\nas a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased. 17 Thou shalt\nbring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made\nfor thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have established. 18 The LORD shall reign for ever\nand ever. 19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD\nbrought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.\n20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after\nher with timbrels and with dances. 21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed\ngloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.\n22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three\ndays in the wilderness, and found no water.\n23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore\nthe name of it was called Marah. 24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? 25 And\nhe cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were\nmade sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, 26 And said, If thou wilt\ndiligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear\nto his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought\nupon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.\n27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they en-\ncamped there by the waters.\nExodus Chapter 16\n1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wil-\nderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out\nof the land of Egypt. 2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in\n20 Hebrew Bible\nthe wilderness: 3 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in\nthe land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth\ninto this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.\n4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out\nand gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. 5 And it shall\ncome to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they\ngather daily. 6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD\nhath brought you out from the land of Egypt: 7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for\nthat he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us? 8 And Moses\nsaid, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full;\nfor that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings\nare not against us, but against the LORD.\n9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the\nLORD: for he hath heard your murmurings. 10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of\nthe children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the\ncloud.\n11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto\nthem, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am\nthe LORD your God.\n13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay\nround about the host. 14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a\nsmall round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. 15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one\nto another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD\nhath given you to eat.\n16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer\nfor every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. 17 And\nthe children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. 18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he\nthat gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according\nto his eating. 19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not\nunto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with\nthem. 21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it\nmelted.\n22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all\nthe rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath\nsaid, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that\nye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. 24 And they laid it up till\nthe morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. 25 And Moses said, Eat that to\nday; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field. 26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on\nthe seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.\n27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found\nnone. 28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? 29 See, for\nthat the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye\nevery man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 30 So the people rested on the seventh day.\n31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it\nwas like wafers made with honey.\n32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your gen-\nerations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from\nthe land of Egypt. 33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up\nbefore the LORD, to be kept for your generations. 34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before\nthe Testimony, to be kept. 35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabit-\ned; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. 36 Now an omer is the tenth part of\nan ephah.\nExodus Chapter 17\n1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys,\naccording to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to\n21 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ndrink. 2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said\nunto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD? 3 And the people thirsted there for water; and\nthe people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill\nus and our children and our cattle with thirst? 4 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this\npeople? they be almost ready to stone me. 5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with\nthee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. 6 Behold, I will\nstand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of\nit, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 7 And he called the name of the\nplace Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD,\nsaying, Is the LORD among us, or not?\n8 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men,\nand go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. 10 So\nJoshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of\nthe hill. 11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand,\nAmalek prevailed. 12 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon;\nand Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands\nwere steady until the going down of the sun. 13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the\nsword. 14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua:\nfor I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. 15 And Moses built an altar, and called the\nname of it Jehovahnissi: 16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek\nfrom generation to generation.\nExodus Chapter 18\n1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses\u2019 father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for\nIsrael his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 2 Then Jethro, Moses\u2019 father in law, took\nZipporah, Moses\u2019 wife, after he had sent her back, 3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom;\nfor he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 4 And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father,\nsaid he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 5 And Jethro, Moses\u2019 father in law, came with\nhis sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 6 And he said unto\nMoses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.\n7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other\nof their welfare; and they came into the tent. 8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto\nPharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel\u2019s sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the\nLORD delivered them. 9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had\ndelivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. 10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of\nthe hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of\nthe Egyptians. 11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he\nwas above them. 12 And Jethro, Moses\u2019 father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came,\nand all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses\u2019 father in law before God.\n13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from\nthe morning unto the evening. 14 And when Moses\u2019 father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What\nis this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from\nmorning unto even? 15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:\n16 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know\nthe statutes of God, and his laws. 17 And Moses\u2019 father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.\n18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou\nart not able to perform it thyself alone. 19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be\nwith thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: 20 And thou shalt teach\nthem ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.\n21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness;\nand place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:\n22 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee,\nbut every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee. 23 If\nthou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also\ngo to their place in peace. 24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. 25 And\nMoses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hun-\n22 Hebrew Bible\ndreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought\nunto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\n27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.\nExodus Chapter 19\n1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came\nthey into the wilderness of Sinai. 2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai,\nand had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. 3 And Moses went up unto God,\nand the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the\nchildren of Israel; 4 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles\u2019 wings, and brought\nyou unto myself. 5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar\ntreasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: 6 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an\nholy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.\n7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the\nLORD commanded him. 8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will\ndo. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.\n9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak\nwith thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.\n10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them\nwash their clothes, 11 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight\nof all the people upon mount Sinai. 12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed\nto yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be\nsurely put to death: 13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be\nbeast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.\n14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their\nclothes.15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.\n16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick\ncloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp\ntrembled. 17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether\npart of the mount. 18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire:\nand the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 19 And when the\nvoice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.\n20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the\ntop of the mount; and Moses went up. 21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they\nbreak through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. 22 And let the priests also, which come near to the\nLORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. 23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people\ncannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. 24 And\nthe LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the\npriests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. 25 So Moses went\ndown unto the people, and spake unto them.\nExodus Chapter 20\n1 And God spake all these words, saying, 2 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of\nEgypt, out of the house of bondage. 3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any\ngraven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the\nwater under the earth. 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a\njealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that\nhate me; 6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 7 Thou shalt not\ntake the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\n8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 10 But the seventh day\nis the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-\nservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 11 For in six days the LORD\nmade heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the\nsabbath day, and hallowed it.\n12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth\nthee. 13 Thou shalt not kill. 14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. 15 Thou shalt not steal. 16 Thou shalt not bear false wit-\n23 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nness against thy neighbour. 17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour\u2019s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour\u2019s wife,\nnor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour\u2019s.\n18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain\nsmoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. 19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou\nwith us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not:\nfor God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. 21 And the people stood\nafar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.\n22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talk-\ned with you from heaven. 23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.\n24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace of-\nferings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.\n25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon\nit, thou hast polluted it. 26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered\nthereon.\nExodus Chapter 21\n1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them. 2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he\nshall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. 3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself:\nif he were married, then his wife shall go out with him. 4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born\nhim sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master\u2019s, and he shall go out by himself. 5 And if the\nservant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: 6 Then his master shall\nbring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his\near through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.\n7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. 8 If she please\nnot her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange\nnation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. 9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son,\nhe shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. 10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her\nduty of marriage, shall he not diminish. 11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without\nmoney.\n12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death. 13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God de-\nliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. 14 But if a man come presumptuously\nupon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.\n15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.\n16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.\n17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.\n18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth\nhis bed: 19 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for\nthe loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.\n20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely pun-\nished. 21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.\n22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he\nshall be surely punished, according as the woman\u2019s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges deter-\nmine. 23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, 24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand,\nfoot for foot, 25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\n26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his\neye\u2019s sake. 27 And if he smite out his manservant\u2019s tooth, or his maidservant\u2019s tooth; he shall let him go free for his\ntooth\u2019s sake.\n28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be\neaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit. 29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath\nbeen testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be\nstoned, and his owner also shall be put to death. 30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the\nransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. 31 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according\nto this judgment shall it be done unto him. 32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto\ntheir master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.\n33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;\n34 The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them;

he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.\nExodus Chapter 22\n1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for\na sheep.\n2 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him. 3 If the sun be\nrisen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he\nshall be sold for his theft. 4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall\nrestore double.\n5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man\u2019s\nfield;

and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto\nhis neighbour. 10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die,\nor be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it: 11 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath\nnot put his hand unto his neighbour\u2019s goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.\n12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. 13 If it be torn in pieces, then let\nhim bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.\n14 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he\nshall surely make it good. 15 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it\ncame for his hire.\n16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. 17 If\nher father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.\n18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\n19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.\n20 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.\n21 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\n22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. 23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto\nme, I will surely hear their cry; 24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives\nshall be widows, and your children fatherless.\n25 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither\nshalt thou lay upon him usury. 26 If thou at all take thy neighbour\u2019s raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him\nby that the sun goeth down: 27 For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and\nit shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.\n28 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.\n29 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou\ngive unto me. 30 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on\nthe eighth day thou shalt give it me.\n31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast\nit to the dogs.\nExodus Chapter 23\n1 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.\n2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest\njudgment:\n3 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.\n4 If thou meet thine enemy\u2019s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. 5 If thou see\nthe ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help\nwith him. 6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. 7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the\n25 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ninnocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.\n8 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.\n9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land\nof Egypt.\n10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof: 11 But the seventh year thou shalt\nlet it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like\nmanner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. 12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the sev-\nenth day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be\nrefreshed. 13 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other\ngods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.\n14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. 15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread:\n(thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in\nit thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:) 16 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits\nof thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when\nthou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field. 17 Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the\nLORD God. 18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice\nremain until the morning. 19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy\nGod. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother\u2019s milk.\n20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have\nprepared. 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my\nname is in him. 22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine\nenemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. 23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto\nthe Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut\nthem off. 24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly\noverthrow them, and quite break down their images. 25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless\nthy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.\n26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil. 27 I will\nsend my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine ene-\nmies turn their backs unto thee. 28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaan-\nite, and the Hittite, from before thee. 29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become\ndesolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. 30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,\nuntil thou be increased, and inherit the land. 31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the\nPhilistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou\nshalt drive them out before thee. 32 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 33 They shall not\ndwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.\nExodus Chapter 24\n1 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the\nelders of Israel; and worship ye afar off. 2 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh;\nneither shall the people go up with him.\n3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people\nanswered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do. 4 And Moses wrote all\nthe words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,\naccording to the twelve tribes of Israel. 5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt\nofferings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD. 6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in\nbasons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the au-\ndience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient. 8 And Moses took the\nblood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with\nyou concerning all these words.\n9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel: 10 And they saw the\nGod of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of\nheaven in his clearness. 11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and\ndid eat and drink.\n12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of\nstone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them. 13 And Moses rose up, and\nhis minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God. 14 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for\n26 Hebrew Bible\nus, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let\nhim come unto them. 15 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. 16 And the glory of the\nLORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of\nthe midst of the cloud. 17 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in\nthe eyes of the children of Israel. 18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and\nMoses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.\nExodus Chapter 25\n1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering:\nof every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering. 3 And this is the offering which ye shall\ntake of them;

and bells of gold between them round about: 34 A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden\nbell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about. 35 And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his\nsound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD, and when he cometh out, that he die\nnot.\n36 And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO\nTHE LORD. 37 And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre\nit shall be. 38 And it shall be upon Aaron\u2019s forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which\nthe children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be\naccepted before the LORD.\n39 And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt\nmake the girdle of needlework.\n40 And for Aaron\u2019s sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou\nmake for them, for glory and for beauty. 41 And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with\nhim; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest\u2019s\noffice. 42 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs\nthey shall reach: 43 And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the\ncongregation, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and\ndie: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.\nExodus Chapter 29\n1 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest\u2019s office:\nTake one young bullock, and two rams without blemish, 2 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered\nwith oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make them. 3 And thou shalt put\nthem into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams. 4 And Aaron and his sons\nthou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water. 5 And thou\nshalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breast-\nplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod: 6 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the\nholy crown upon the mitre. 7 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him.\n8 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them. 9 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his\nsons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest\u2019s office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt\nconsecrate Aaron and his sons. 10 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congre-\ngation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock. 11 And thou shalt kill the bull-\nock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 12 And thou shalt take of the blood of the\nbullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.\n13 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys,\nand the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar. 14 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his\ndung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.\n15 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. 16 And\nthou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar. 17 And thou shalt\ncut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head.\n18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an\noffering made by fire unto the LORD.\n19 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.\n20 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the\n30 Hebrew Bible\ntip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot,\nand sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 21 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of\nthe anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments\nof his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons\u2019 garments with him.\n22 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above\nthe liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:\n23 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that\nis before the LORD: 24 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave\nthem for a wave offering before the LORD. 25 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the\naltar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 26 And\nthou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron\u2019s consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and\nit shall be thy part. 27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering,\nwhich is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that\nwhich is for his sons: 28 And it shall be Aaron\u2019s and his sons\u2019 by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is\nan heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offer-\nings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.\n29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons\u2019 after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in\nthem. 30 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of\nthe congregation to minister in the holy place.\n31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place. 32 And Aaron and his\nsons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congre-\ngation. 33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them:\nbut a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy. 34 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the\nbread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is\nholy. 35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee:\nseven days shalt thou consecrate them. 36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement:\nand thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.\n37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatso-\never toucheth the altar shall be holy.\n38 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually. 39 The\none lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even: 40 And with the one lamb a\ntenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a\ndrink offering. 41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering\nof the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the\nLORD. 42 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee. 43 And there I will meet with the\nchildren of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. 44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the con-\ngregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest\u2019s office.\n45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. 46 And they shall know that I am the\nLORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD\ntheir God.\nExodus Chapter 30\n1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it. 2 A cubit shall be the\nlength thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof:\nthe horns thereof shall be of the same. 3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides\nthereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. 4 And two\ngolden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt\nthou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. 5 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim\nwood, and overlay them with gold. 6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before\nthe mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. 7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense\nevery morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. 8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at\neven, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. 9 Ye shall\noffer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering there-\non. 10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of\natonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the\n31 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nLORD.\n11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their\nnumber, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that\nthere be no plague among them, when thou numberest them. 13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among\nthem that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel\nshall be the offering of the LORD. 14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old\nand above, shall give an offering unto the LORD. 15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less\nthan half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 16 And thou\nshalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the\ncongregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for\nyour souls.\n17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass,\nto wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put\nwater therein. 19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: 20 When they go into the\ntabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to\nminister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: 21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die\nnot: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.\n22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh\nfive hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet cala-\nmus two hundred and fifty shekels, 24 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil\nolive an hin: 25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothe-\ncary: it shall be an holy anointing oil. 26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the\nark of the testimony, 27 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,\n28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot. 29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that\nthey may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. 30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and\nconsecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest\u2019s office. 31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of\nIsrael, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. 32 Upon man\u2019s flesh shall it\nnot be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto\nyou. 33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off\nfrom his people.\n34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet\nspices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: 35 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection\nafter the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy: 36 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and\nput of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you\nmost holy. 37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the com-\nposition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD. 38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto,\nshall even be cut off from his people.\nExodus Chapter 31\n1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur,\nof the tribe of Judah: 3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowl-\nedge, and in all manner of workmanship, 4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,\n5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. 6 And I,\nbehold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are\nwise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; 7 The tabernacle of the con-\ngregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,\n8 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, 9 And the\naltar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot, 10 And the cloths of service, and the holy\ngarments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest\u2019s office, 11 And the anointing\noil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.\n12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my\nsabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I\nam the LORD that doth sanctify you. 14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that\ndefileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among\nhis people. 15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever\ndoeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. 16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep\n32 Hebrew Bible\nthe sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 17 It is a sign between\nme and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he\nrested, and was refreshed.\n18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of\ntestimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.\nExodus Chapter 32\n1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves\ntogether unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man\nthat brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 2 And Aaron said unto them, Break\noff the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them\nunto me. 3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.\n4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and\nthey said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 5 And when Aaron saw it, he\nbuilt an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. 6 And they rose\nup early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat\nand to drink, and rose up to play.\n7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of\nEgypt, have corrupted themselves: 8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they\nhave made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods,\nO Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this\npeople, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 10 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against\nthem, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. 11 And Moses besought the LORD his\nGod, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the\nland of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? 12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For\nmischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth?\nTurn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. 13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,\nthy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of\nheaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. 14 And\nthe LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.\n15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the\ntables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. 16 And the tables were\nthe work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 17 And when Joshua heard the\nnoise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. 18 And he said, It is not\nthe voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of\nthem that sing do I hear.\n19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses\u2019\nanger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. 20 And he took the calf\nwhich they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made\nthe children of Israel drink of it.\n21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon\nthem? 22 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mis-\nchief. 23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought\nus up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any\ngold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.\n25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among\ntheir enemies:) 26 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD\u2019s side? let him come\nunto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. 27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the\nLORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp,\nand slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. 28 And the children of\nLevi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 29 For Mo-\nses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he\nmay bestow upon you a blessing this day.\n30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now\nI will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. 31 And Moses returned unto\nthe LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 32 Yet now, if thou\n33 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nwilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 33 And the LORD\nsaid unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. 34 Therefore now go, lead the\npeople unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the\nday when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. 35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,\nwhich Aaron made.\nExodus Chapter 33\n1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up\nout of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed\nwill I give it:\n2 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the\nPerizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:\n3 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked\npeople: lest I consume thee in the way.\n4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.\n5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up\ninto the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may\nknow what to do unto thee.\n6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.\n7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tab-\nernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the taber-\nnacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.\n8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every\nman at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.\n9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door\nof the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.\n10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and wor-\nshipped, every man in his tent door.\n11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into\nthe camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.\n12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me\nknow whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my\nsight. 13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee,\nthat I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. 14 And he said, My presence shall go\nwith thee, and I will give thee rest. 15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.\n16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest\nwith us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth. 17 And the\nLORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I\nknow thee by name. 18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. 19 And he said, I will make all my goodness\npass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be\ngracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. 20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there\nshall no man see me, and live. 21 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a\nrock: 22 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover\nthee with my hand while I pass by: 23 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face\nshall not be seen.\nExodus Chapter 34\n1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these\ntables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest. 2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in\nthe morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. 3 And no man shall come\nup with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that\nmount.\n4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up\nunto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.\n5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.\n6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-\n34 Hebrew Bible\nsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, 7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression\nand sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon\nthe children\u2019s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. 8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head\ntoward the earth, and worshipped. 9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD,\nI pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine\ninheritance.\n10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in\nall the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a\nterrible thing that I will do with thee. 11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out be-\nfore thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 12 Take\nheed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare\nin the midst of thee: 13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: 14 For thou\nshalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God: 15 Lest thou make a covenant\nwith the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one\ncall thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 16 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a\nwhoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. 17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.\n18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded\nthee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. 19 All that openeth the ma-\ntrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male. 20 But the firstling of an ass thou\nshalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons\nthou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.\n21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.\n22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at\nthe year\u2019s end.\n23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel. 24 For I will cast\nout the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up\nto appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year. 25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;\nneither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. 26 The first of the firstfruits of thy\nland thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother\u2019s milk. 27 And\nthe LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with\nthee and with Israel.\n28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And\nhe wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.\n29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses\u2019\nhand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with\nhim. 30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were\nafraid to come nigh him. 31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned\nunto him: and Moses talked with them. 32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in\ncommandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 33 And till Moses had done speaking with\nthem, he put a vail on his face. 34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off,\nuntil he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. 35 And\nthe children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses\u2019 face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face\nagain, until he went in to speak with him.\nExodus Chapter 35\n1 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the\nwords which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them. 2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh\nday there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to\ndeath. 3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.\n4 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD\ncommanded, saying, 5 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let\nhim bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass, 6 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine\nlinen, and goats\u2019 hair, 7 And rams\u2019 skins dyed red, and badgers\u2019 skins, and shittim wood, 8 And oil for the light, and\nspices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, 9 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the\nbreastplate. 10 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded; 11 The\ntabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets, 12 The ark, and\n35 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthe staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering, 13 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels,\nand the shewbread, 14 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,\n15 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door\nat the entering in of the tabernacle, 16 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels,\nthe laver and his foot, 17 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the\ncourt, 18 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords, 19 The cloths of service, to do service\nin the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest\u2019s\noffice.\n20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 21 And they came,\nevery one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD\u2019s\noffering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments. 22 And\nthey came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings,\nand tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD. 23 And every\nman, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats\u2019 hair, and red skins of rams,\nand badgers\u2019 skins, brought them. 24 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD\u2019s\noffering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it. 25 And all the\nwomen that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and\nof purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen. 26 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats\u2019\nhair. 27 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; 28 And spice,\nand oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. 29 The children of Israel brought a willing\noffering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work,\nwhich the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.\n30 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the\nson of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; 31 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and\nin knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; 32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and\nin brass, 33 And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.\n34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.\n35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning work-\nman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them\nthat do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.\nExodus Chapter 36\n1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and under-\nstanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD\nhad commanded. 2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD\nhad put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 3 And they received of\nMoses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make\nit withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning. 4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the\nwork of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;\n5 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work,\nwhich the LORD commanded to make. 6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So\nthe people were restrained from bringing. 7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too\nmuch.\n8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine\ntwined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them. 9 The length of\none curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one\nsize. 10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto anoth-\ner. 11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in\nthe uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second. 12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty\nloops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to an-\nother. 13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became\none tabernacle.\n14 And he made curtains of goats\u2019 hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. 15 The\nlength of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of\none size. 16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 17 And he made fifty loops\n36 Hebrew Bible\nupon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which\ncoupleth the second. 18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. 19 And he\nmade a covering for the tent of rams\u2019 skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers\u2019 skins above that.\n20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up. 21 The length of a board was ten cubits,\nand the breadth of a board one cubit and a half. 22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another:\nthus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 23 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for\nthe south side southward: 24 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one\nboard for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons. 25 And for the other side of the\ntabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards, 26 And their forty sockets of silver; two sock-\nets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made\nsix boards. 28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. 29 And they were coupled\nbeneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.\n30 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.\n31 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 32 And five bars for\nthe boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.\n33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other. 34 And he overlaid the\nboards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.\n35 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cun-\nning work. 36 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of\ngold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.\n37 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of\nneedlework; 38 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold:\nbut their five sockets were of brass.\nExodus Chapter 37\n1 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half\nthe breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it: 2 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without,\nand made a crown of gold to it round about. 3 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of\nit; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it. 4 And he made staves of shittim\nwood, and overlaid them with gold. 5 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.\n6 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a\nhalf the breadth thereof. 7 And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two\nends of the mercy seat; 8 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out\nof the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof. 9 And the cherubims spread out their wings on\nhigh, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward\nwere the faces of the cherubims.\n10 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof,\nand a cubit and a half the height thereof: 11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold\nround about. 12 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for\nthe border thereof round about. 13 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that\nwere in the four feet thereof. 14 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.\n15 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table. 16 And he made the\nvessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure\ngold.\n17 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch,\nhis bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same: 18 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three\nbranches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side\nthereof: 19 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made\nlike almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.\n20 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers: 21 And a knop under two\nbranches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same,\naccording to the six branches going out of it. 22 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one\nbeaten work of pure gold. 23 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold. 24 Of a\ntalent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.\n25 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it\nwas foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same. 26 And he overlaid it with\n37 Compact Anthology of World Literature\npure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of\ngold round about. 27 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon\nthe two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal. 28 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and\noverlaid them with gold.\n29 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apoth-\necary.\nExodus Chapter 38\n1 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the\nbreadth thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof. 2 And he made the horns thereof on the four\ncorners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass. 3 And he made all the vessels of the\naltar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he\nof brass. 4 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst\nof it. 5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves. 6 And he made the\nstaves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass. 7 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar,\nto bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.\n8 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the lookingglasses of the women assembling,\nwhich assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n9 And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an\nhundred cubits: 10 Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets\nwere of silver. 11 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their\nsockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. 12 And for the west side were hangings of\nfifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. 13 And for the\neast side eastward fifty cubits. 14 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and\ntheir sockets three. 15 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen\ncubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. 16 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined\nlinen. 17 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the\noverlaying of their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. 18 And the hanging for\nthe gate of the court was needlework, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was\nthe length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court. 19 And their pillars\nwere four, and their sockets of brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets\nof silver. 20 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.\n21 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the com-\nmandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest. 22 And Bezaleel\nthe son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses. 23 And with him\nwas Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in\nblue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen. 24 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of\nthe holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels,\nafter the shekel of the sanctuary. 25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred\ntalents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 26 A\nbekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered,\nfrom twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.\n27 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred\nsockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels\nhe made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them. 29 And the brass of the offering was\nseventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels. 30 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of\nthe tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,\n31 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and\nall the pins of the court round about.\nExodus Chapter 39\n1 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made\nthe holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses. 2 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple,\nand scarlet, and fine twined linen. 3 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in\nthe blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work. 4 They made shoulderpieces\nfor it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together. 5 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was\n38 Hebrew Bible\nupon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen;\nas the LORD commanded Moses.\n6 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the\nchildren of Israel. 7 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to\nthe children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n8 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and\nscarlet, and fine twined linen. 9 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof,\nand a span the breadth thereof, being doubled. 10 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardi-\nus, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row. 11 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.\n12 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. 13 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they\nwere inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings. 14 And the stones were according to the names of the children\nof Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to\nthe twelve tribes. 15 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold. 16 And\nthey made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate. 17 And\nthey put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate. 18 And the two ends of the\ntwo wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.\n19 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which\nwas on the side of the ephod inward. 20 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the\nephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the\nephod. 21 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might\nbe above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD\ncommanded Moses.\n22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. 23 And there was an hole in the midst of the\nrobe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend. 24 And they made upon\nthe hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen. 25 And they made bells of\npure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pome-\ngranates; 26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as\nthe LORD commanded Moses.\n27 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, 28 And a mitre of fine linen, and\ngoodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen, 29 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue,\nand purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n30 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of\na signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD. 31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as\nthe LORD commanded Moses.\n32 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did\naccording to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.\n33 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars,\nand his pillars, and his sockets, 34 And the covering of rams\u2019 skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers\u2019 skins, and\nthe vail of the covering, 35 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat, 36 The table, and all\nthe vessels thereof, and the shewbread, 37 The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be\nset in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light, 38 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the\nsweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door, 39 The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all\nhis vessels, the laver and his foot, 40 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the\ncourt gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congrega-\ntion, 41 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons\u2019\ngarments, to minister in the priest\u2019s office. 42 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of\nIsrael made all the work. 43 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had\ncommanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.\nExodus Chapter 40\n1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle\nof the tent of the congregation. 3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the\nvail. 4 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt\nbring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. 5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the\nark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. 6 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt\noffering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 7 And thou shalt set the laver between the\n39 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ntent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. 8 And thou shalt set up the court round about,\nand hang up the hanging at the court gate. 9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all\nthat is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy. 10 And thou shalt anoint the altar\nof the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. 11 And thou shalt\nanoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. 12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tab-\nernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. 13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and\nanoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest\u2019s office. 14 And thou shalt bring his sons,\nand clothe them with coats: 15 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister\nunto me in the priest\u2019s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their genera-\ntions.\n16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.\n17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle\nwas reared up. 18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and\nput in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars. 19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the\ncovering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above\nupon the ark: 21 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark\nof the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the\nvail. 23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle\nsouthward. 25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail: 27 And he burnt sweet incense\nthereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.\n28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle. 29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door\nof the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the\nLORD commanded Moses.\n30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.\n31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat: 32 When they went into the tent of\nthe congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses. 33 And\nhe reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses\nfinished the work.\n34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 35 And\nMoses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of\nthe LORD filled the tabernacle. 36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel\nwent onward in all their journeys: 37 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it\nwas taken up. 38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight\nof all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.\nAmerican Standard Version\nLicense: Open Access\nGenesis Chapter 1\n1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was\nupon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters\n3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God di-\nvided the light from the darkness. 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was\nevening and there was morning, one day.\n6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\n7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which\nwere above the firmament: and it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there\nwas morning, a second day.\n9 And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land\nappear: and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas:\nand God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and] fruit-trees\nbearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so. 12 And the earth brought\nforth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind:\n40 Hebrew Bible\nand God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.\n14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them\nbe for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years: 15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give\nlight upon the earth: and it was so. 16 And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the\nlesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light\nupon the earth, 18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God\nsaw that it was good. 19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\n20 And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in\nthe open firmament of heaven. 21 And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth,\nwherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.\n22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on\nthe earth. 23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\n24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and\nbeasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so. 25 And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the\ncattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.\n26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of\nthe sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing\nthat creepeth upon the earth. 27 And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male\nand female created he them. 28 And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and re-\nplenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and\nover every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\n29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and\nevery tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food: 30 and to every beast of the earth,\nand to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, [I have given]\nevery green herb for food: and it was so. 31 And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very\ngood. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.\nGenesis Chapter 2\n1 And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 2 And on the seventh day God finished\nhis work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 3 And God\nblessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and\nmade.\n4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God\nmade earth and heaven. 5 And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up;\nfor Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground; 6 but there\nwent up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 7 And Jehovah God formed man of the\ndust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\n8 And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 9 And\nout of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of\nlife also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 10 And a river went out of Eden\nto water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads. 11 The name of the first is Pishon: that\nis it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 12 and the gold of that land is good: there is\nbdellium and the onyx stone. 13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole\nland of Cush. 14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the\nfourth river is the Euphrates. 15 And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and\nto keep it.\n16 And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 17 but of\nthe tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt\nsurely die.\n18 And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.\n19 And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought\nthem unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was\nthe name thereof. 20 And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the\nfield; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.\n21 And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and\nclosed up the flesh instead thereof: 22 and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman,\n41 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nand brought her unto the man. 23 And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall\nbe called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. 24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and\nshall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were\nnot ashamed.\nGenesis Chapter 3\n1 Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto\nthe woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden? 2 And the woman said unto the serpent,\nOf the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat: 3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,\nGod hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye\nshall not surely die: 5 for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall\nbe as God, knowing good and evil.\n6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the\ntree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her hus-\nband with her, and he did eat. 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and\nthey sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 8 And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking\nin the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God\namongst the trees of the garden.\n9 And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou? 10 And he said, I heard thy voice in\nthe garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\n11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee\nthat thou shouldest not eat? 12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the\ntree, and I did eat. 13 And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said,\nThe serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\n14 And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and\nabove every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 15 and I\nwill put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and\nthou shalt bruise his heel. 16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain\nthou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\n17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree,\nof which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat\nof it all the days of thy life; 18 thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the\nfield; 19 in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken:\nfor dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. 20 And the man called his wife\u2019s name Eve; because she was the\nmother of all living. 21 And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.\n22 And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put\nforth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever- 23 therefore Jehovah God sent him forth\nfrom the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at\nthe east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of\nthe tree of life.\nGenesis Chapter 4\n1 And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with [the\nhelp of] Jehovah. 2 And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the\nground.\n3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.\n4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel\nand to his offering: 5 but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his coun-\ntenance fell.\n6 And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 7 If thou doest well,\nshall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do\nthou rule over it. 8 And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose\nup against Abel his brother, and slew him.\n9 And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother\u2019s keep-\ner? 10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother\u2019s blood crieth unto me from the ground. 11 And\nnow cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother\u2019s blood from thy hand;\n42 Hebrew Bible\n12 when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt\nthou be in the earth.\n13 And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear. 14 Behold, thou hast driven me out\nthis day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the\nearth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me. 15 And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore\nwhosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest\nany finding him should smite him.\n16 And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 17 And\nCain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city,\nafter the name of his son, Enoch. 18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat\nMethushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.\n19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.\n20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle. 21 And his brother\u2019s name was\nJubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe. 22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of\nevery cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.\n23 And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my\nspeech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me: 24 If Cain shall be avenged sev-\nenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.\n25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth. For, [said she], God hath ap-\npointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him. 26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and\nhe called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.\nGenesis Chapter 5\n1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he\nhim; 2 male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were\ncreated.\n3 And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat [a son] in his own likeness, after his image; and called\nhis name Seth: 4 and the days of Adam after he begat Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daugh-\nters. 5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.\n6 And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enosh: 7 and Seth lived after he begat Enosh eight hundred\nand seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 8 and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and\nhe died.\n9 And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan. 10 and Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and fif-\nteen years, and begat sons and daughters: 11 and all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years: and he died.\n12 And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel: 13 and Kenan lived after he begat Mahalalel eight hun-\ndred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: 14 and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years:\nand he died.\n15 And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 16 And Mahalalel lived after he begat Jared eight\nhundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:\n17 and all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.\n18 And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch: 19 and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight\nhundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years:\nand he died.\n21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 22 and Enoch walked with God after he begat\nMethuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 23 and all the days of Enoch were three hundred six-\nty and five years: 24 and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.\n25 And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech: 26 and Methuselah lived after he\nbegat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters. 27 And all the days of Methuselah\nwere nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.\n28 And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 29 and he called his name Noah, saying,\nThis same shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, [which cometh] because of the ground which\nJehovah hath cursed. 30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons\nand daughters: 31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died. 32 And\nNoah was five hundred years old: And Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\nGenesis Chapter 6\n43 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto\nthem, 2 that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they\nchose. 3 And Jehovah said, My spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be a\nhundred and twenty years.\n4 The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came unto the daugh-\nters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.\n5 And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the\nthoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\n6 And it repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 7 And Jehovah\nsaid, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground; both man, and beast, and creeping things,\nand birds of the heavens; for it repenteth me that I have made them.\n8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.\n9 These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, [and] perfect in his generations: Noah walked\nwith God. 10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n11 And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12 And God saw the earth, and,\nbehold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.\n13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through\nthem; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.\n14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without\nwith pitch. 15 And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty\ncubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 16 A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it\nupward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou\nmake it. 17 And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of\nlife, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die. 18 But I will establish my covenant with thee; and\nthou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons\u2019 wives with thee. 19 And of every living\nthing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male\nand female. 20 Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground\nafter its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. 21 And take thou unto thee of all food that\nis eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 22 Thus did Noah; according to all that\nGod commanded him, so did he.\nGenesis Chapter 7\n1 And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before\nme in this generation. 2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of\nthe beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female: 3 of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male\nand female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon\nthe earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the\nground.\n5 And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him. 6 And Noah was six hundred years old when\nthe flood of waters was upon the earth.\n7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons\u2019 wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters\nof the flood. 8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon\nthe ground, 9 there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah. 10 And\nit came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.\n11 In the six hundredth year of Noah\u2019s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the\nsame day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. 12 And the\nrain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\n13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah\u2019s wife, and\nthe three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 14 they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their\nkind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of\nevery sort. 15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life. 16 And\nthey that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in.\n17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted\nup above the earth. 18 And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the\nface of the waters. 19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were\nunder the whole heaven were covered. 20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were\n44 Hebrew Bible\ncovered.\n21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that\ncreepeth upon the earth, and every man: 22 all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on\nthe dry land, died. 23 And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cat-\ntle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left,\nand they that were with him in the ark. 24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.\nGenesis Chapter 8\n1 And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God\nmade a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged; 2 the fountains also of the deep and the windows of\nheaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 3 and the waters returned from off the earth contin-\nually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.\n4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.\n5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month,\nwere the tops of the mountains seen.\n6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:\n7 and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8 And he\nsent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 9 but the dove found no\nrest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth:\nand he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark. 10 And he stayed yet other seven\ndays; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 11 and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her\nmouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 12 And he stayed yet\nother seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more.\n13 And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters\nwere dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of\nthe ground was dried. 14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.\n15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 16 Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons\u2019\nwives with thee. 17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and\nevery creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and\nmultiply upon the earth. 18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons\u2019 wives with him: 19 every\nbeast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out\nof the ark.\n20 And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered\nburnt-offerings on the altar. 21 And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again\ncurse the ground any more for man\u2019s sake, for that the imagination of man\u2019s heart is evil from his youth; neither will\nI again smite any more everything living, as I have done. 22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and\ncold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\nGenesis Chapter 9\n1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\n2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heav-\nens; With all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered. 3 Every\nmoving thing that liveth shall be food for you; As the green herb have I given you all. 4 But flesh with the life there-\nof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 5 And surely your blood, [the blood] of your lives, will I require;\nAt the hand of every beast will I require it. And at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man\u2019s brother, will\nI require the life of man. 6 Whoso sheddeth man\u2019s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: For in the image of God\nmade he man. 7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.\n8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with\nyou, and with your seed after you; 10 and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every\nbeast of the earth with you. Of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. 11 And I will establish my\ncovenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more\nbe a flood to destroy the earth.\n12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature\nthat is with you, for perpetual generations: 13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant\nbetween me and the earth. 14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be\nseen in the cloud, 15 and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of\n45 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nall flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and\nI will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all\nflesh that is upon the earth. 17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established\nbetween me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\nExodus Chapter 1\n1 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with\nJacob): 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.\n5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already. 6 And\nJoseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.\n7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding\nmighty; and the land was filled with them.\n8 Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph. 9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the\npeople of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: 10 come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they mul-\ntiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight\nagainst us, and get them up out of the land. 11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their\nburdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses. 12 But the more they afflicted them, the more\nthey multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. 13 And\nthe Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor: 14 and they made their lives bitter with hard service,\nin mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, wherein they made them serve\nwith rigor.\n15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the\nname of the other Puah: 16 and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them\nupon the birth-stool; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. 17 But the mid-\nwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive. 18 And\nthe king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the\nmen-children alive? 19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian\nwomen; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them. 20 And God dealt well with the mid-\nwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God,\nthat he made them households. 22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast\ninto the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.\nExodus Chapter 2\n1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. 2 And the woman conceived,\nand bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. 3 And when she could\nnot longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the\nchild therein, and laid it in the flags by the river\u2019s brink. 4 And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done\nto him.\n5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the riv-\ner-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it. 6 And she opened it, and saw the\nchild: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews\u2019 children.\n7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may\nnurse the child for thee? 8 And Pharaoh\u2019s daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child\u2019s\nmother. 9 And Pharaoh\u2019s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy\nwages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. 10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh\u2019s\ndaughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.\n11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked\non their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren. 12 And he looked this way and that\nway, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 13 And he went out\nthe second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong,\nWherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to\nkill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known. 15 Now when Pharaoh\nheard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:\nand he sat down by a well.\n16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water\ntheir father\u2019s flock. 17 And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and\n46 Hebrew Bible\nwatered their flock. 18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-\nday? 19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for\nus, and watered the flock. 20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man?\nCall him, that he may eat bread. 21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his\ndaughter. 22 And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign\nland.\n23 And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel\nsighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 24 And\nGod heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 25 And\nGod saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge [of them].\nExodus Chapter 3\n1 Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the\nback of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb. 2 And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto\nhim in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the\nbush was not consumed. 3 And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.\n4 And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,\nMoses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. 5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for\nthe place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abra-\nham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.\n7 And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by\nreason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 8 and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the\nEgyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and\nhoney; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the\nJebusite. 9 And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression\nwherewith the Egyptians oppress them. 10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest\nbring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.\n11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the\nchildren of Israel out of Egypt? 12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee,\nthat I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.\n13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of\nyour fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them? 14 And\nGod said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath\nsent me unto you. 15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah,\nthe God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is\nmy name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.\n16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of\nAbraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and [seen] that which\nis done to you in Egypt: 17 and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the\nCanaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing\nwith milk and honey. 18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto\nthe king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us: and now let us go,\nwe pray thee, three days\u2019 journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.\n19 And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand. 20 And I will put\nforth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let\nyou go. 21 And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go,\nye shall not go empty. 22 But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels\nof silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye\nshall despoil the Egyptians.\nExodus Chapter 4\n1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will\nsay, Jehovah hath not appeared unto thee. 2 And Jehovah said unto him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A\nrod. 3 And he said, Cast in on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled\nfrom before it. 4 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail: (and he put forth his\nhand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand:) 5 That they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their\n47 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nfathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.\n6 And Jehovah said furthermore unto him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his\nbosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as [white as] snow. 7 And he said, Put thy hand into\nthy bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was\nturned again as his [other] flesh.) 8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the\nvoice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not\nbelieve even these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour\nit upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.\n10 And Moses said unto Jehovah, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken\nunto thy servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. 11 And Jehovah said unto him, Who hath made\nman\u2019s mouth? Or who maketh [a man] dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah? 12 Now therefore go,\nand I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak. 13 And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray thee, by\nthe hand of him whom thou wilt send. 14 And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there\nnot Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee:\nand when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. 15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his\nmouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. 16 And he shall be thy\nspokesman unto the people; and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as\nGod. 17 And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.\n18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and\nreturn unto my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.\n19 And Jehovah said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead that sought thy life.\n20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses\ntook the rod of God in his hand. 21 And Jehovah said unto Moses, When thou goest back into Egypt, see that thou\ndo before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart and he will not let the\npeople go. 22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, Israel is my son, my first-born: 23 and I have said\nunto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and thou hast refused to let him go: behold, I will slay thy son, thy\nfirst-born.\n24 And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that Jehovah met him, and sought to kill him. 25 Then\nZipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, Surely a bridegroom\nof blood art thou to me. 26 So he let him alone. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood [art thou], because of the\ncircumcision.\n27 And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the moun-\ntain of God, and kissed him. 28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah wherewith he had sent him, and all\nthe signs wherewith he had charged him.\n29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: 30 and Aaron spake\nall the words which Jehovah had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. 31 And the people\nbelieved: and when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction,\nthen they bowed their heads and worshipped.\nExodus Chapter 5\n1 And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my\npeople go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. 2 And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should\nhearken unto his voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and moreover I will not let Israel go.\n3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days\u2019 journey into the\nwilderness, and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. 4 And the\nking of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? get you unto\nyour burdens. 5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their\nburdens. 6 And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, 7 Ye\nshall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 8 And\nthe number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught\nthereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. 9 Let heavier work be laid\nupon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard lying words.\n10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus\nsaith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. 11 Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your\nwork shall be diminished. 12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble\nfor straw. 13 And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfil your works, [your] daily tasks, as when there was straw.\n48 Hebrew Bible\n14 And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh\u2019s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and de-\nmanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and to-day, in making brick as heretofore?\n15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus\nwith thy servants? 16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy\nservants are beaten; but the fault it in thine own people. 17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us\ngo and sacrifice to Jehovah. 18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver\nthe number of bricks. 19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, when it was said,\nYe shall not diminish aught from your bricks, [your] daily tasks.\n20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 21 and they said\nunto them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge: because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pha-\nraoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. 22 And Moses returned unto Jehovah,\nand said, Lord, wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? 23 For since I came to\nPharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.\nExodus Chapter 6\n1 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he\nlet them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. 2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto\nhim, I am Jehovah: 3 and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name\nJehovah I was not known to them. 4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of\nCanaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned. 5 And moreover I have heard the groaning of the\nchildren of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. 6 Wherefore say\nunto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I\nwill rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments: 7 and\nI will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who\nbringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 8 And I will bring you in unto the land which I sware to\ngive to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am Jehovah.\n9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and\nfor cruel bondage.\n10 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, 11 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of\nIsrael go out of his land. 12 And Moses spake before Jehovah, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hear-\nkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? 13 And Jehovah spake unto Moses\nand unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the\nchildren of Israel out of the land of Egypt.\n14 These are the heads of their fathers\u2019 houses. The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu,\nHezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben. 15 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and\nJachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman; these are the families of Simeon.\n16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari;\nand the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years. 17 The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei,\naccording to their families. 18 And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of\nthe life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years. 19 And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the\nfamilies of the Levites according to their generations. 20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father\u2019s sister to wife;\nand she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years.\n21 And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 22 And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and\nSithri. 23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, to wife; and she bare\nhim Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 24 And the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are\nthe families of the Korahites. 25 And Eleazar Aaron\u2019s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she\nbare him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers\u2019 [houses] of the Levites according to their families. 26 These\nare that Aaron and Moses, to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according\nto their hosts. 27 These are they that spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt:\nthese are that Moses and Aaron.\n28 And it came to pass on the day when Jehovah spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, 29 that Jehovah spake\nunto Moses, saying, I am Jehovah: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee. 30 And Moses\nsaid before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?\nExodus Chapter 7\n1 And Jehovah said unto Moses, See, I have made thee as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy\n49 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nprophet. 2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let\nthe children of Israel go out of his land. 3 And I will harden Pharaoh\u2019s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders\nin the land of Egypt. 4 But Pharaoh will not hearken unto you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth\nmy hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 5 And the Egyptians shall\nknow that I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among\nthem. 6 And Moses and Aaron did so; as Jehovah commanded them, so did they. 7 And Moses was fourscore years\nold, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.\n8 And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 9 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show\na wonder for you; then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a\nserpent.\n10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so, as Jehovah had commanded: and Aaron cast\ndown his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 11 Then Pharaoh also called for the\nwise men and the sorcerers: and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments.\n12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron\u2019s rod swallowed up their rods. 13 And\nPharaoh\u2019s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.\n14 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh\u2019s heart is stubborn, he refuseth to let the people go. 15 Get thee unto\nPharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river\u2019s brink to meet him; and\nthe rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand. 16 And thou shalt say unto him, Jehovah, the God\nof the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and,\nbehold, hitherto thou hast not hearkened. 17 Thus saith Jehovah, In this thou shalt know that I am Jehovah: behold, I\nwill smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.\n18 And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink\nwater from the river.\n19 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of\nEgypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may\nbecome blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of\nstone. 20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that\nwere in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river\nwere turned to blood. 21 And the fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could\nnot drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. 22 And the magicians of Egypt\ndid in like manner with their enchantments: and Pharaoh\u2019s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them;\nas Jehovah had spoken. 23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart. 24 And\nall the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.\n25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that Jehovah had smitten the river.\nExodus Chapter 8\n1 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go,\nthat they may serve me. 2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: 3 and the\nriver shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy\nbed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs:\n4 and the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.\n5 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the\nstreams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. 6 And Aaron stretched out his hand\nover the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 7 And the magicians did in like\nmanner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.\n8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat Jehovah, that he take away the frogs from me,\nand from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto Jehovah. 9 And Moses said unto\nPharaoh, Have thou this glory over me: against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy\npeople, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only? 10 And he said, Against\nto-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto Jehovah\nour God. 11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people;\nthey shall remain in the river only. 12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto Jehovah\nconcerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh. 13 And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses;\nand the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields. 14 And they gathered them together in\nheaps; and the land stank. 15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened\nnot unto them, as Jehovah had spoken.\n50 Hebrew Bible\n16 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that is\nmay become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 17 And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his\nrod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became\nlice throughout all the land of Egypt. 18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but\nthey could not: and there were lice upon man, and upon beast. 19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the\nfinger of God: and Pharaoh\u2019s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.\n20 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to\nthe water; and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 21 Else, if thou wilt not\nlet my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon they servants, and upon thy people, and\ninto thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they\nare. 22 And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be\nthere; to the end thou mayest know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth. 23 And I will put a division between\nmy people and thy people: by to-morrow shall this sign be. 24 And Jehovah did so; and there came grievous swarms\nof flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants\u2019 houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted\nby reason of the swarms of flies.\n25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. 26 And Moses\nsaid, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God: lo, shall\nwe sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? 27 We will go three days\u2019\njourney into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as he shall command us. 28 And Pharaoh said, I will\nlet you go, that ye may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat\nfor me. 29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat Jehovah that the swarms of flies may depart\nfrom Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more\nin not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah. 30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.\n31 And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his\nservants, and from his people; there remained not one. 32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did\nnot let the people go.\nExodus Chapter 9\n1 Then Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews,\nLet my people go, that they may serve me. 2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 3 behold, the\nhand of Jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon\nthe herds, and upon the flocks: [there shall be] a very grievous murrain. 4 And Jehovah shall make a distinction\nbetween the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children\nof Israel. 5 And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow Jehovah shall do this thing in the land. 6 And Jeho-\nvah did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not\none. 7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart\nof Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.\n8 And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses\nsprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. 9 And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and\nshall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. 10 And they\ntook ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil\nbreaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast. 11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of\nthe boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. 12 And Jehovah hardened the heart of\nPharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses.\n13 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him,\nThus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 14 For I will this time send\nall my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is\nnone like me in all the earth. 15 For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence,\nand thou hadst been cut off from the earth: 16 but in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee\nmy power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. 17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my\npeople, that thou wilt not let them go? 18 Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous\nhail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now. 19 Now therefore send, hasten in\nthy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; [for] every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not\nbe brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. 20 He that feared the word of Jehovah\namong the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses. 21 And he that regarded not the\nword of Jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field.\n51 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n22 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of\nEgypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. 23 And Moses\nstretched forth his rod toward heaven: and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and\nJehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt. 24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such\nas had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of\nEgypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree\nof the field. 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.\n27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: Jehovah is\nrighteous, and I and my people are wicked. 28 Entreat Jehovah; for there hath been enough of [these] mighty thun-\nderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. 29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am\ngone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto Jehovah; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any\nmore hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah\u2019s. 30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will\nnot yet fear Jehovah God. 31 And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was\nin bloom. 32 But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up. 33 And Moses went out of the\ncity from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto Jehovah: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was\nnot poured upon the earth. 34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he\nsinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did\nnot let the children of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by Moses.\nExodus Chapter 10\n1 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his ser-\nvants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them, 2 and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of\nthy son\u2019s son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may\nknow that I am Jehovah. 3 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the\nGod of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve\nme. 4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border: 5 and they shall\ncover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which\nis escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:\n6 and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy\nfathers nor thy fathers\u2019 fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned,\nand went out from Pharaoh. 7 And Pharaoh\u2019s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us?\nlet the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? 8 And Moses\nand Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve Jehovah your God; but who are they\nthat shall go? 9 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters,\nwith our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto Jehovah. 10 And he said unto them, So\nbe Jehovah with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you. 11 Not so: go now ye\nthat are men, and serve Jehovah; for that is what ye desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh\u2019s presence.\n12 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come\nup upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left. 13 And Moses stretched\nforth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night;\nand when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 14 And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt,\nand rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they,\nneither after them shall be such. 15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and\nthey did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any\ngreen thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.\n16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God,\nand against you. 17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that he\nmay take away from me this death only. 18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah. 19 And Jehovah\nturned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained\nnot one locust in all the border of Egypt. 20 But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh\u2019s heart, and he did not let the children of\nIsrael go.\n21 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land\nof Egypt, even darkness which may be felt. 22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a\nthick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days; 23 they saw not one another, neither rose any one from his place\nfor three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\n24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve Jehovah; only let your flocks and your herds be\n52 Hebrew Bible\nstayed: let your little ones also go with you. 25 And Moses said, Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and\nburnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice unto Jehovah our God. 26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a\nhoof be left behind: for thereof must we take to serve Jehovah our God; and we know not with what we must serve\nJehovah, until we come thither.\n27 But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh\u2019s heart, and he would not let them go. 28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee\nfrom me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die. 29 And Moses\nsaid, Thou hast spoken well. I will see thy face again no more.\nExodus Chapter 11\n1 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he\nwill let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. 2 Speak now in the\nears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver,\nand jewels of gold. 3 And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was\nvery great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh\u2019s servants, and in the sight of the people.\n4 And Moses said, Thus saith Jehovah, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: 5 and all the\nfirst-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the\nfirst-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of cattle. 6 And there shall be a great cry\nthroughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath not been, nor shall be any more. 7 But against any of the chil-\ndren of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that Jehovah doth make\na distinction between the Egyptians and Israel. 8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow\ndown themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And\nhe went out from Pharaoh in hot anger. 9 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; that\nmy wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh:\nand Jehovah hardened Pharaoh\u2019s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.\nExodus Chapter 12\n1 And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, 2 This month shall be unto you the\nbeginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.\n3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth [day] of this month they shall take to them\nevery man a lamb, according to their fathers\u2019 houses, a lamb for a household: 4 and if the household be too little for\na lamb, then shall he and his neighbor next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according\nto every man\u2019s eating ye shall make your count for the lamb. 5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old:\nye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats: 6 and ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month;\nand the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at even. 7 And they shall take of the blood, and put\nit on the two side-posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they shall eat it. 8 And they shall eat the flesh in\nthat night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it. 9 Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at\nall with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof. 10 And ye shall let nothing of it\nremain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.\n11 And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye\nshall eat it in haste: it is Jehovah\u2019s passover. 12 For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all\nthe first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I\nam Jehovah. 13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I\nwill pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. 14 And this\nday shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah: throughout your generations ye shall\nkeep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. 15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put\naway leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that\nsoul shall be cut off from Israel. 16 And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh\nday a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only\nmay be done by you. 17 And ye shall observe the [feast of] unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought\nyour hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance\nfor ever.\n18 In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one\nand twentieth day of the month at even. 19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever\neateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or\none that is born in the land. 20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.\n21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out, and take you lambs according\n53 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nto your families, and kill the passover. 22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the\nbasin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of\nthe door of his house until the morning. 23 For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth\nthe blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroy-\ner to come in unto your houses to smite you. 24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy\nsons for ever. 25 And it shall come to pass, when ye are come to the land which Jehovah will give you, according as\nhe hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. 26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you,\nWhat mean ye by this service? 27 that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of Jehovah\u2019s passover, who passed over the houses\nof the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed\nthe head and worshipped. 28 And the children of Israel went and did so; as Jehovah had commanded Moses and\nAaron, so did they.\n29 And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born\nof Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of\ncattle. 30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry\nin Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.\n31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye\nand the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said. 32 Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have\nsaid, and be gone; and bless me also. 33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the\nland in haste; for they said, We are all dead men. 34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their\nkneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. 35 And the children of Israel did accord-\ning to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. 36 And\nJehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they\ndespoiled the Egyptians.\n37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that\nwere men, besides children. 38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very\nmuch cattle. 39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not\nleavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any\nvictuals.\n40 Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. 41 And it came to\npass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of Jehovah\nwent out from the land of Egypt. 42 It is a night to be much observed unto Jehovah for bringing them out from the\nland of Egypt: this is that night of Jehovah, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their gener-\nations.\n43 And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no foreigner eat\nthereof; 44 but every man\u2019s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat\nthereof. 45 A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof. 46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry\nforth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. 47 All the congregation of\nIsrael shall keep it. 48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to Jehovah, let all his\nmales be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: but\nno uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. 49 One law shall be to him that is home-born, and unto the stranger that\nsojourneth among you. 50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.\n51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their\nhosts.\nExodus Chapter 13\n1 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb\namong the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.\n3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of\nbondage; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.\n4 This day ye go forth in the month Abib.\n5 And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite,\nand the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey,\nthat thou shalt keep this service in this month. 6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day\nshall be a feast to Jehovah. 7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and there shall no leavened\nbread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee, in all thy borders.\n8 And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which Jehovah did for me when I came\n54 Hebrew Bible\nforth out of Egypt. 9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that\nthe law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath Jehovah brought thee out of Egypt. 10 Thou\nshalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.\n11 And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he sware unto thee and to thy\nfathers, and shall give it thee, 12 that thou shalt set apart unto Jehovah all that openeth the womb, and every first-\nling which thou hast that cometh of a beast; the males shall be Jehovah\u2019s. 13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt\nredeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck: and all the first-born of man\namong thy sons shalt thou redeem.\n14 And it shall be, when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him,\nBy strength of hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: 15 and it came to pass, when\nPharaoh would hardly let us go, that Jehovah slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man,\nand the first-born of beast: therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the first-\nborn of my sons I redeem. 16 And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by\nstrength of hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt.\n17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the\nPhilistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they\nreturn to Egypt: 18 but God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea: and the children of\nIsrael went up armed out of the land of Egypt. 19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly\nsworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.\n20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 21 And\nJehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give\nthem light, that they might go by day and by night: 22 the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, de-\nparted not from before the people.\nExodus Chapter 14\n1 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp\nbefore Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon: over against it shall ye encamp by the sea.\n3 And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.\n4 And I will harden Pharaoh\u2019s heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and\nupon all his host: and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.\n5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was\nchanged towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?\n6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: 7 and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all\nthe chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them. 8 And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt,\nand he pursued after the children of Israel: for the children of Israel went out with a high hand. 9 And the Egyptians\npursued after them, all the horses [and] chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them\nencamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.\n10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were\nmarching after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah. 11 And they said\nunto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore\nhast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt? 12 Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt,\nsaying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we\nshould die in the wilderness.\n13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work\nfor you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. 14 Jehovah will\nfight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.\n15 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go\nforward. 16 And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel\nshall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground. 17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they\nshall go in after them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his\nhorsemen. 18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon\nhis chariots, and upon his horsemen.\n19 And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of\ncloud removed from before them, and stood behind them: 20 and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp\nof Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one came not near the other\nall the night.\n55 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah caused the sea to go [back] by a strong east wind\nall the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 22 And the children of Israel went into the\nmidst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.\n23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh\u2019s horses, his char-\niots, and his horsemen. 24 And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked forth upon the host of\nthe Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians. 25 And he took off\ntheir chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for\nJehovah fighteth for them against the Egyptians.\n26 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the\nEgyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. 27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and\nthe sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Jehovah over-\nthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen,\neven all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; there remained not so much as one of them. 29 But\nthe children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their\nright hand, and on their left. 30 Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw\nthe Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore. 31 And Israel saw the great work which Jehovah did upon the Egyptians, and\nthe people feared Jehovah: and they believed in Jehovah, and in his servant Moses.\nExodus Chapter 15\n1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto Jehovah, and spake, saying, I will sing unto Jehovah,\nfor he hath triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 2 Jehovah is my strength and\nsong, And he is become my salvation: This is my God, and I will praise him; My father\u2019s God, and I will exalt him.\n3 Jehovah is a man of war: Jehovah is his name. 4 Pharaoh\u2019s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea; And his\nchosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea. 5 The deeps cover them: They went down into the depths like a stone. 6 Thy\nright hand, O Jehovah, is glorious in power, Thy right hand, O Jehovah, dasheth in pieces the enemy. 7 And in the\ngreatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee: Thou sendest forth thy wrath, it con-\nsumeth them as stubble. 8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up, The floods stood upright as a\nheap; The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea. 9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide\nthe spoil; My desire shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. 10 Thou didst\nblow with thy wind, the sea covered them: They sank as lead in the mighty waters. 11 Who is like unto thee, O Jeho-\nvah, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders? 12 Thou stretchedst\nout thy right hand, The earth swallowed them. 13 Thou in thy lovingkindness hast led the people that thou hast\nredeemed: Thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation. 14 The peoples have heard, they tremble:\nPangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia. 15 Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed; The mighty men of\nMoab, trembling taketh hold upon them: All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away. 16 Terror and dread falleth\nupon them; By the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone; Till thy people pass over, O Jehovah, Till the\npeople pass over that thou hast purchased. 17 Thou wilt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine in-\nheritance, The place, O Jehovah, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, The sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands\nhave established. 18 Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever. 19 For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and\nwith his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Isra-\nel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.\n20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after\nher with timbrels and with dances. 21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to Jehovah, for he hath triumphed glori-\nously; The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.\n22 And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went\nthree days in the wilderness, and found no water.\n23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore\nthe name of it was called Marah. 24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? 25 An\nhe cried unto Jehovah; And Jehovah showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made\nsweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them; 26 and he said, If thou wilt\ndiligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to\nhis commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the\nEgyptians: for I am Jehovah that healeth thee.\n27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees: and they\nencamped there by the waters.\n56 Hebrew Bible\nExodus Chapter 16\n1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wil-\nderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out\nof the land of Egypt. 2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against\nAaron in the wilderness: 3 and the children of Israel said unto them, Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah\nin the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth\ninto this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.\n4 Then said Jehovah unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out\nand gather a day\u2019s portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not. 5 And it shall\ncome to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they\ngather daily. 6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that Jehovah\nhath brought you out from the land of Egypt; 7 and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of Jehovah; for that\nhe heareth your murmurings against Jehovah: and what are we, that ye murmur against us? 8 And Moses said, [This\nshall be], when Jehovah shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that Jeho-\nvah heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against\nus, but against Jehovah.\n9 And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before Jeho-\nvah; for he hath heard your murmurings. 10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the\nchildren of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.\n11 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, 12 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto\nthem, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye shall know that I am\nJehovah your God.\n13 And it came to pass at even, that the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew\nlay round about the camp. 14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness a\nsmall round thing, small as the hoar-frost on the ground. 15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to\nanother, What is it? For they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, It is the bread which Jehovah hath\ngiven you to eat.\n16 This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Gather ye of it every man according to his eating; an omer\na head, according to the number of your persons, shall ye take it, every man for them that are in his tent. 17 And the\nchildren of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less. 18 And when they measured it with an omer, he that\ngathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his\neating. 19 And Moses said unto them, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 20 Notwithstanding they hearkened\nnot unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was\nwroth with them. 21 And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the\nsun waxed hot, it melted.\n22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and\nall the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 23 And he said unto them, This is that which Jehovah hath\nspoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto Jehovah: bake that which ye will bake, and boil that which\nye will boil; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. 24 And they laid it up till the\nmorning, as Moses bade: and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm therein. 25 And Moses said, Eat\nthat to-day; for to-day is a sabbath unto Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field. 26 Six days ye shall gather it;\nbut on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.\n27 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather, and they found\nnone. 28 And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? 29 See, for\nthat Jehovah hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye\nevery man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 30 So the people rested on the seventh day.\n31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it\nwas like wafers [made] with honey.\n32 And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout\nyour generations, that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth\nfrom the land of Egypt. 33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it\nup before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations. 34 As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up\nbefore the Testimony, to be kept. 35 And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a\nland inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. 36 Now an omer is\nthe tenth part of an ephah.\n57 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nExodus Chapter 17\n1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys,\naccording to the commandment of Jehovah, and encamped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to\ndrink. 2 Wherefore the people stove with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto\nthem, Why strive ye with me? Wherefore do ye tempt Jehovah? 3 And the people thirsted there for water; and the\npeople murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our\nchildren and our cattle with thirst? 4 And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, What shall I do unto this people? They\nare almost ready to stone me. 5 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the\nelders of Israel; and they rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go. 6 Behold, I will stand\nbefore thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that\nthe people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 7 And he called the name of the place\nMassah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tempted Jehovah, saying, Is\nJehovah among us, or not?\n8 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men,\nand go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand. 10 So\nJoshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of\nthe hill. 11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand,\nAmalek prevailed. 12 But Moses\u2019 hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon;\nand Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; And his hands\nwere steady until the going down of the sun. 13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the\nsword. 14 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua:\nthat I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. 15 And Moses built an altar, and called\nthe name of it Jehovah-nissi; 16 And he said, Jehovah hath sworn: Jehovah will have war with Amalek from genera-\ntion to generation.\nExodus Chapter 18\n1 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses\u2019 father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for\nIsrael his people, how that Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt. 2 And Jethro, Moses\u2019 father-in-law, took Zippo-\nrah, Moses\u2019 wife, after he had sent her away, 3 and her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he\nsaid, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land: 4 and the name of the other was Eliezer; for [he said], The God of my\nfather was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh. 5 And Jethro, Moses\u2019 father-in-law, came with his\nsons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God: 6 and he said unto\nMoses, I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.\n7 And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other\nof their welfare; and they came into the tent. 8 And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done unto\nPharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel\u2019s sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how Jehovah\ndelivered them. 9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Jehovah had done to Israel, in that he had delivered\nthem out of the hand of the Egyptians. 10 And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath delivered you out of the\nhand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the\nEgyptians. 11 Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods; yea, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against\nthem. 12 And Jethro, Moses\u2019 father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the\nelders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses\u2019 father-in-law before God.\n13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood about Moses\nfrom the morning unto the evening. 14 And when Moses\u2019 father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said,\nWhat is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee\nfrom morning unto even? 15 And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire\nof God: 16 when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make\nthem know the statutes of God, and his laws. 17 And Moses\u2019 father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest\nis not good. 18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for\nthee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. 19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God\nbe with thee: be thou for the people to God-ward, and bring thou the causes unto God: 20 and thou shalt teach them\nthe statutes and the laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.\n21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain;\nand place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 22 and\nlet them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every\nsmall matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear [the burden] with thee.\n58 Hebrew Bible\n23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also\nshall go to their place in peace. 24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.\n25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers\nof hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they\nbrought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\n27 And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.\nExodus Chapter 19\n1 In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came\nthey into the wilderness of Sinai. 2 And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilder-\nness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount. 3 And Moses went\nup unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob,\nand tell the children of Israel: 4 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles\u2019 wings,\nand brought you unto myself. 5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall\nbe mine own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine: 6 and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of\npriests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.\n7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah\ncommanded him. 8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do. And\nMoses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah.\n9 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak\nwith thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto Jehovah.\n10 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them\nwash their garments, 11 and be ready against the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight\nof all the people upon mount Sinai. 12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed\nto yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be\nsurely put to death: 13 no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or\nman, he shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.\n14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their\ngarments. 15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman.\n16 And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a\nthick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp\ntrembled. 17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part\nof the mount. 18 And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the\nsmoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 19 And when the voice of\nthe trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. 20 And Jehovah came down\nupon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went\nup. 21 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to gaze,\nand many of them perish. 22 And let the priests also, that come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah\nbreak forth upon them. 23 And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst\ncharge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. 24 And Jehovah said unto him, Go, get thee down;\nand thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up\nunto Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them. 25 So Moses went down unto the people, and told them.\nExodus Chapter 20\n1 And God spake all these words, saying, 2 I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt,\nout of the house of bondage. 3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 4 Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven\nimage, nor any likeness [of any thing] that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water\nunder the earth. 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them, for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous\nGod, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them\nthat hate me, 6 and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.\n7 Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his\nname in vain. 8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; 10 but\nthe seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy\ndaughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 11 for in six\ndays Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore Jehovah\nblessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.\n59 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n12 Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.\n13 Thou shalt not kill. 14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. 15 Thou shalt not steal. 16 Thou shalt not bear false witness\nagainst thy neighbor. 17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor\u2019s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor\u2019s wife, nor his\nman-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor\u2019s.\n18 And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the\nmountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off. 19 And they said unto Moses,\nSpeak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 20 And Moses said unto the people,\nFear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not. 21 And the people stood\nafar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.\n22 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I\nhave talked with you from heaven. 23 Ye shall not make [other gods] with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall\nnot make unto you.\n24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-of-\nferings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless\nthee. 25 And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon\nit, thou hast polluted it. 26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered\nthereon.\nExodus Chapter 21\n1 Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them. 2 If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he\nshall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. 3 If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself:\nif he be married, then his wife shall go out with him. 4 If his master give him a wife and she bear him sons or daugh-\nters; the wife and her children shall be her master\u2019s, and he shall go out by himself. 5 But if the servant shall plainly\nsay, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: 6 then his master shall bring him unto God,\nand shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and\nhe shall serve him for ever.\n7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do. 8 If she please\nnot her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a foreign peo-\nple he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. 9 And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall\ndeal with her after the manner of daughters. 10 If he take him another [wife]; her food, her raiment, and her duty of\nmarriage, shall he not diminish. 11 And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out for nothing,\nwithout money.\n12 He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death. 13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God\ndeliver [him] into his hand;

he shall surely be pun-\nished. 21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.\n22 And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he\nshall be surely fined, according as the woman\u2019s husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges deter-\nmine. 23 But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot\nfor foot, 25 burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\n26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his\neye\u2019s sake. 27 And if he smite out his man-servant\u2019s tooth, or his maid-servant\u2019s tooth, he shall let him go free for his\ntooth\u2019s sake.\n28 And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten;\nbut the owner of the ox shall be quit. 29 But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to its\nowner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also\nshall be put to death. 30 If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatso-\never is laid upon him. 31 Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it\nbe done unto him. 32 If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given unto their master thirty\n60 Hebrew Bible\nshekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.\n33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein, 34 the\nowner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner thereof, and the dead [beast] shall be his.\n35 And if one man\u2019s ox hurt another\u2019s, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it:\nand the dead also they shall divide. 36 Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath\nnot kept it in, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead [beast] shall be his own.\nExodus Chapter 22\n1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a\nsheep.\n2 If the thief be found breaking in, and be smitten so that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him. 3 If\nthe sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him; he shall make restitution: if he have nothing, then\nhe shall be sold for his theft. 4 If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall pay\ndouble.\n5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man\u2019s\nfield;

he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.\n7 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man\u2019s house; if the\nthief be found, he shall pay double. 8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto\nGod, [to see] whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbor\u2019s goods. 9 For every matter of trespass, whether\nit be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, [or] for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith, This is it, the cause\nof both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbor. 10 If a man\ndeliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no\nman seeing it: 11 the oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, whether he hath not put his hand unto his neigh-\nbor\u2019s goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution. 12 But if it be stolen from him,\nhe shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. 13 If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness: he shall not\nmake good that which was torn.\n14 And if a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall\nsurely make restitution. 15 If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be a hired thing, it came for\nits hire.\n16 And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be\nhis wife. 17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.\n18 Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live.\n19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.\n20 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto Jehovah only, shall be utterly destroyed.\n21 And a sojourner shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him: for ye were sojourners in the land of\nEgypt.\n22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. 23 If thou afflict them at all, and they cry at all unto me, I\nwill surely hear their cry; 24 and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be\nwidows, and your children fatherless.\n25 If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither\nshall ye lay upon him interest. 26 If thou at all take thy neighbor\u2019s garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him\nbefore the sun goeth down: 27 for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? And\nit shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.\n28 Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people.\n29 Thou shalt not delay to offer of thy harvest, and of the outflow of thy presses. The first-born of thy sons shalt\nthou give unto me. 30 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, [and] with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with its\ndam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.\n31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye\nshall cast it to the dogs.\nExodus Chapter 23\n1 Thou shalt not take up a false report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.\n2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude\nto wrest [justice]:\n61 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n3 neither shalt thou favor a poor man in his cause.\n4 If thou meet thine enemy\u2019s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. 5 If thou see\nthe ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, thou shalt forbear to leave him, thou shalt surely release [it]\nwith him. 6 Thou shalt not wrest the justice [due] to thy poor in his cause. 7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and\nthe innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.\n8 And thou shalt take no bribe: for a bribe blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righ-\nteous.\n9 And a sojourner shalt thou not oppress: for ye know the heart of a sojourner, seeing ye were sojourners in the\nland of Egypt.\n10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof: 11 but the seventh year thou\nshalt let it rest and lie fallow; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat.\nIn like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, [and] with thy oliveyard. 12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and\non the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the\nsojourner, may be refreshed. 13 And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the\nname of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.\n14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. 15 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep:\nseven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in\nit thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty: 16 and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of\nthy labors, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in\nthy labors out of the field. 17 Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah. 18 Thou shalt\nnot offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the\nmorning. 19 The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt\nnot boil a kid in it mother\u2019s milk.\n20 Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have\nprepared. 21 Take ye heed before him, and hearken unto his voice; provoke him not; for he will not pardon your\ntransgression: for my name is in him. 22 But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then\nI will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. 23 For mine angel shall go before\nthee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the\nJebusite: and I will cut them off. 24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works;\nbut thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars. 25 And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and\nhe will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.\n26 There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil. 27 I will send\nmy terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies\nturn their backs unto thee. 28 And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaan-\nite, and the Hittite, from before thee. 29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become\ndesolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee. 30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,\nuntil thou be increased, and inherit the land. 31 And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the\nPhilistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand: and\nthou shalt drive them out before thee. 32 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 33 They shall\nnot dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto\nthee.\nExodus Chapter 24\n1 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto Jehovah, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the\nelders of Israel; and worship ye afar off: 2 and Moses alone shall come near unto Jehovah; but they shall not come\nnear; neither shall the people go up with him.\n3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the ordinances: and all the people\nanswered with one voice, and said, All the words which Jehovah hath spoken will we do. 4 And Moses wrote all the\nwords of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, ac-\ncording to the twelve tribes of Israel. 5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings,\nand sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto Jehovah. 6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and\nhalf of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the\npeople: and they said, All that Jehovah hath spoken will we do, and be obedient. 8 And Moses took the blood, and\nsprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which Jehovah hath made with you concern-\ning all these words.\n9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. 10 And they saw the\n62 Hebrew Bible\nGod of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven\nfor clearness. 11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: and they beheld God, and did eat\nand drink.\n12 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee the tables of\nstone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them. 13 And Moses rose\nup, and Joshua his minister: and Moses went up into the mount of God. 14 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye\nhere for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: whosoever hath a cause, let\nhim come near unto them. 15 And Moses went up into the mount, and the cloud covered the mount. 16 And the glo-\nry of Jehovah abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses\nout of the midst of the cloud. 17 And the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the\nmount in the eyes of the children of Israel. 18 And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the\nmount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.\nExodus Chapter 25\n1 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for me an offering: of\nevery man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take my offering. 3 And this is the offering which ye shall take\nof them: gold, and silver, and brass, 4 and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats\u2019 [hair], 5 and rams\u2019\nskins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood, 6 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet\nincense, 7 onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. 8 And let them make me a sanctu-\nary, that I may dwell among them. 9 According to all that I show thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern\nof all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it.\n10 And they shall make an ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a\nhalf the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. 11 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within\nand without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. 12 And thou shalt cast four\nrings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof;

of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, shalt thou make it. 16 Foursquare\nit shall be [and] double; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof. 17 And thou shalt set in it\nsettings of stones, four rows of stones: a row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle shall be the first row; 18 and the second\nrow an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond; 19 and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 20 and the\nfourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be inclosed in gold in their settings. 21 And the stones shall\nbe according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet,\n65 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nevery one according to his name, they shall be for the twelve tribes.\n22 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold. 23 And thou shalt\nmake upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 24 And\nthou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. 25 And the [other]\ntwo ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the\nephod in the forepart thereof.\n26 And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon\nthe edge thereof, which is toward the side of the ephod inward. 27 And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and\nshalt put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling\nthereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod. 28 And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto\nthe rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the\nbreastplate be not loosed from the ephod. 29 And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breast-\nplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before Jehovah continually.\n30 And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aar-\non\u2019s heart, when he goeth in before Jehovah: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his\nheart before Jehovah continually.\n31 And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue. 32 And it shall have a hole for the head in the midst\nthereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of a coat of mail, that it\nbe not rent.\n33 And upon the skirts of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the\nskirts thereof; and bells of gold between them round about: 34 a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and\na pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about. 35 And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and the sound\nthereof shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before Jehovah, and when he cometh out, that he die\nnot.\n36 And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO JEHO-\nVAH. 37 And thou shalt put it on a lace of blue, and it shall be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall\nbe. 38 And it shall be upon Aaron\u2019s forehead, and Aaron shall bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the chil-\ndren of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted\nbefore Jehovah.\n39 And thou shalt weave the coat in checker work of fine linen, and thou shalt make a mitre of fine linen, and\nthou shalt make a girdle, the work of the embroiderer.\n40 And for Aaron\u2019s sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and head-tires shalt thou\nmake for them, for glory and for beauty. 41 And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and upon his sons\nwith him, and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the\npriest\u2019s office. 42 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness; from the loins even\nunto the thighs they shall reach: 43 And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they go in unto the tent\nof meeting, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die:\nit shall be a statute for ever unto him and unto his seed after him.\nExodus Chapter 29\n1 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest\u2019s office:\ntake one young bullock and two rams without blemish, 2 and unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened mingled\nwith oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of fine wheaten flour shalt thou make them. 3 And thou shalt\nput them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams. 4 And Aaron and his\nsons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water. 5 And thou shalt take\nthe garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and\ngird him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod; 6 and thou shalt set the mitre upon his head, and put the holy\ncrown upon the mitre. 7 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him. 8 And\nthou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them. 9 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons,\nand bind head-tires on them: and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate\nAaron and his sons. 10 And thou shalt bring the bullock before the tent of meeting: and Aaron and his sons shall\nlay their hands upon the head of the bullock. 11 And thou shalt kill the bullock before Jehovah, at the door of the\ntent of meeting. 12 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy\nfinger; and thou shalt pour out all the blood at the base of the altar. 13 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth\nthe inwards, and the caul upon the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon\nthe altar. 14 But the flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and it dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a\n66 Hebrew Bible\nsin-offering.\n15 Thou shalt also take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.\n16 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take its blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar. 17 And thou\nshalt cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head.\n18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering unto Jehovah; it is a sweet savor, an offer-\ning made by fire unto Jehovah.\n19 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.\n20 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the\ntip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot,\nand sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 21 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of\nthe anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments\nof his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons\u2019 garments with him.\n22 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul of the\nliver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of consecration), 23 and\none loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before\nJehovah. 24 And thou shalt put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and shalt wave\nthem for a wave-offering before Jehovah. 25 And thou shalt take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar\nupon the burnt-offering, for a sweet savor before Jehovah: it is an offering made by fire unto Jehovah. 26 And thou\nshalt take the breast of Aaron\u2019s ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: and it shall be\nthy portion. 27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave-offering, and the thigh of the heave-offering, which\nis waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is\nfor his sons: 28 and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as [their] portion for ever from the children of Israel; for it is a\nheave-offering: and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings,\neven their heave-offering unto Jehovah.\n29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated\nin them. 30 Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, when he cometh into the tent of meeting\nto minister in the holy place.\n31 And thou shalt take the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place. 32 And Aaron and his sons\nshall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting. 33 And they\nshall eat those things wherewith atonement was made, to consecrate [and] to sanctify them: but a stranger shall\nnot eat thereof, because they are holy. 34 And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto\nthe morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. 35 And thus shalt\nthou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate\nthem. 36 And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin-offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar,\nwhen thou makest atonement for it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. 37 Seven days thou shalt make atonement\nfor the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar shall be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.\n38 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually. 39 The\none lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even: 40 and with the one lamb a\ntenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a\nhin of wine for a drink-offering. 41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to\nthe meal-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering thereof, for a sweet savor, an offering made\nby fire unto Jehovah. 42 It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of\nmeeting before Jehovah, where I will meet with you, to speak there unto thee. 43 And there I will meet with the chil-\ndren of Israel; and [the Tent] shall be sanctified by my glory. 44 And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar:\nAaron also and his sons will I sanctify, to minister to me in the priest\u2019s office.\n45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.\n46 And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I\nmight dwell among them: I am Jehovah their God.\nExodus Chapter 30\n1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of acacia wood shalt thou make it. 2 A cubit shall be the\nlength thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be the height thereof:\nthe horns thereof shall be of one piece with it. 3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the\nsides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. 4 And\ntwo golden rings shalt thou make for it under the crown thereof; upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it\nshalt thou make them; and they shall be for places for staves wherewith to bear it. 5 And thou shalt make the staves\n67 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nof acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. 6 And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimo-\nny, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. 7 And Aaron shall burn thereon\nincense of sweet spices: every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it. 8 And when Aaron lighteth the\nlamps at even, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations. 9 Ye shall offer no\nstrange incense thereon, nor burnt-offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon. 10 And\nAaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement\nonce in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto Jehovah.\n11 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, 12 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to\nthose that are numbered of them, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto Jehovah, when thou\nnumberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them. 13 This they shall give, every\none that passeth over unto them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary; (the shekel is\ntwenty gerahs;) half a shekel for an offering to Jehovah. 14 Every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered,\nfrom twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of Jehovah. 15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor\nshall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.\n16 And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the\ntent of meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your\nsouls.\n17 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, 18 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass,\nwhereat to wash. And thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.\n19 And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: 20 when they go into the tent of meeting,\nthey shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering\nmade by fire unto Jehovah. 21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute\nfor ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.\n22 Moreover Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, 23 Take thou also unto thee the chief spices: of flowing myrrh\nfive hundred [shekels], and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two\nhundred and fifty, 24 and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin. 25 And thou\nshalt make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing\noil. 26 And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, 27 and the table and all the\nvessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense, 28 and the altar of burnt-offering\nwith all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof. 29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be\nmost holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. 30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them,\nthat they may minister unto me in the priest\u2019s office. 31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This\nshall be a holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. 32 Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured,\nneither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition thereof: it is holy, [and] it shall be holy unto you.\n33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his\npeople.\n34 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices\nwith pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight; 35 and thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after\nthe art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure [and] holy: 36 and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put\nof it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. 37 And\nthe incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves: it shall\nbe unto thee holy for Jehovah. 38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereof, he shall be cut off from his\npeople.\nExodus Chapter 31\n1 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, 2 See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of\nthe tribe of Judah: 3 and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowl-\nedge, and in all manner of workmanship, 4 to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 5 and\nin cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship. 6 And I, behold,\nI have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all that are\nwise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee: 7 the tent of meeting, and the\nark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent, 8 and the table and its\nvessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense, 9 and the altar of burnt-offering with\nall its vessels, and the laver and its base, 10 and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the\npriest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest\u2019s office, 11 and the anointing oil, and the incense of\nsweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.\n68 Hebrew Bible\n12 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, 13 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily ye shall\nkeep my sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am\nJehovah who sanctifieth you. 14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that profaneth\nit shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his peo-\nple. 15 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Jehovah: whosoever\ndoeth any work on the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. 16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the\nsabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 17 It is a sign between me\nand the children of Israel for ever: for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested,\nand was refreshed.\n18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two\ntables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.\nExodus Chapter 32\n1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people gathered themselves\ntogether unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man\nthat brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. 2 And Aaron said unto them,\nBreak off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them\nunto me. 3 And all the people brake off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.\n4 And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf: and they said,\nThese are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 5 And when Aaron saw [this], he built\nan altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To-morrow shall be a feast to Jehovah. 6 And they rose\nup early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat\nand to drink, and rose up to play.\n7 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, that thou broughtest up out of the land of\nEgypt, have corrupted themselves: 8 they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they\nhave made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed unto it, and said, These are thy gods, O\nIsrael, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 9 And Jehovah said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,\nbehold, it is a stiffnecked people: 10 now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that\nI may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. 11 And Moses besought Jehovah his God, and said,\nJehovah, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, that thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with\ngreat power and with a mighty hand? 12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil did he bring them\nforth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath,\nand repent of this evil against thy people. 13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou\nswarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land\nthat I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. 14 And Jehovah repented of the\nevil which he said he would do unto his people.\n15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables\nthat were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. 16 And the tables were the\nwork of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 17 And when Joshua heard the noise\nof the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. 18 And he said, It is not the\nvoice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome; but the noise of\nthem that sing do I hear.\n19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses\u2019\nanger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. 20 And he took the calf\nwhich they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the\nchildren of Israel drink of it.\n21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?\n22 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are [set] on evil. 23 For\nthey said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of\nthe land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. 24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them\nbreak it off: so they gave it me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.\n25 And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among\ntheir enemies,) 26 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoso is on Jehovah\u2019s side, [let him come]\nunto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. 27 And he said unto them, Thus saith\nJehovah, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate through-\nout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor. 28 And\n69 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthe sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.\n29 And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to Jehovah, yea, every man against his son, and against his brother;\nthat he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.\n30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I\nwill go up unto Jehovah; peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin. 31 And Moses returned unto Jehovah,\nand said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive\ntheir sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 33 And Jehovah said unto Moses,\nWhosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. 34 And now go, lead the people unto [the place]\nof which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will\nvisit their sin upon them. 35 And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.\nExodus Chapter 33\n1 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the\nland of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give\nit: 2 and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the\nPerizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 3 unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of\nthee, for thou art a stiffnecked people, lest I consume thee in the way.\n4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.\n5 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst\nof thee for one moment, I shall consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know\nwhat to do unto thee. 6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb on-\nward.\n7 Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it, The\ntent of meeting. And it came to pass, that every one that sought Jehovah went out unto the tent of meeting, which\nwas without the camp. 8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and\nstood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent. 9 And it came to pass,\nwhen Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent: and [Jehovah]\nspake with Moses. 10 And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose\nup and worshipped, every man at his tent door. 11 And Jehovah spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh\nunto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed\nnot out of the Tent.\n12 And Moses said unto Jehovah, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know\nwhom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found favor in my sight.\n13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, show me now thy ways, that I may know thee, to\nthe end that I may find favor in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. 14 And he said, My presence\nshall go [with thee], and I will give thee rest. 15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not [with me], carry us not\nup hence. 16 For wherein now shall it be known that I have found favor in thy sight, I and thy people? is it not in\nthat thou goest with us, so that we are separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the\nearth? 17 And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken; for thou hast found favor in\nmy sight, and I know thee by name. 18 And he said, Show me, I pray thee, thy glory. 19 And he said, I will make all\nmy goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee; and I will be gracious to whom\nI will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. 20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for\nman shall not see me and live. 21 and Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon the\nrock: 22 and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover\nthee with my hand until I have passed by: 23 and I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back; but my face\nshall not be seen.\nExodus Chapter 34\n1 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon the tables\nthe words that were on the first tables, which thou brakest. 2 And be ready by the morning, and come up in the\nmorning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount. 3 And no man shall come up\nwith thee; neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that\nmount.\n4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up\nunto mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone.\n5 And Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah. 6 And\n70 Hebrew Bible\nJehovah passed by before him, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and\nabundant in lovingkindness and truth, 7 keeping lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression\nand sin; and that will by no means clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon\nthe children\u2019s children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation. 8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his\nhead toward the earth, and worshipped. 9 And he said, If now I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord,\nI pray thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for\nthine inheritance.\n10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been\nwrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of Jehovah;\nfor it is a terrible thing that I do with thee. 11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive\nout before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.\n12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for\na snare in the midst of thee: 13 but ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut\ndown their Asherim; 14 for thou shalt worship no other god: for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:\n15 lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot after their gods, and sacrifice\nunto their gods, and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice; 16 and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons,\nand their daughters play the harlot after their gods, and make thy sons play the harlot after their gods. 17 Thou shalt\nmake thee no molten gods.\n18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I command-\ned thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. 19 All that\nopeneth the womb is mine; and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of cow and sheep. 20 And the firstling of an\nass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the first-born\nof thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.\n21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt\nrest.\n22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, [even] of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingather-\ning at the year\u2019s end.\n23 Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel. 24 For I will cast\nout nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou goest up to ap-\npear before Jehovah thy God three times in the year. 25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened\nbread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. 26 The first of the first-fruits\nof thy ground thou shalt bring unto the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother\u2019s milk.\n27 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant\nwith thee and with Israel.\n28 And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he\nwrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.\n29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Mo-\nses\u2019 hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his\nspeaking with him. 30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone;\nand they were afraid to come nigh him. 31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congre-\ngation returned unto him: and Moses spake to them. 32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he\ngave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 33 And when Moses had done\nspeaking with them, he put a veil on his face. 34 But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took\nthe veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was command-\ned. 35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses\u2019 face shone: and Moses put the veil\nupon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.\nExodus Chapter 35\n1 And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them, These are the words\nwhich Jehovah hath commanded, that ye should do them. 2 Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day\nthere shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to Jehovah: whosoever doeth any work therein shall be put\nto death. 3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.\n4 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah\ncommanded, saying, 5 Take ye from among you an offering unto Jehovah; whosoever is of a willing heart, let him\nbring it, Jehovah\u2019s offering: gold, and silver, and brass, 6 and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats\u2019\n[hair], 7 and rams\u2019 skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood, 8 and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing\n71 Compact Anthology of World Literature\noil, and for the sweet incense, 9 and onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. 10 And\nlet every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all that Jehovah hath commanded: 11 the tabernacle, its tent,\nand its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; 12 the ark, and the staves thereof, the\nmercy-seat, and the veil of the screen; 13 the table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the showbread; 14 the can-\ndlestick also for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light; 15 and the altar of incense, and its\nstaves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle; 16 the\naltar of burnt-offering, with its grating of brass, it staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base; 17 the hangings of\nthe court, the pillars thereof, and their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court; 18 the pins of the tabernacle,\nand the pins of the court, and their cords; 19 the finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy\ngarments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest\u2019s office.\n20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 21 And they came,\nevery one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, [and] brought Jehovah\u2019s offer-\ning, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all the service thereof, and for the holy garments. 22 And they came,\nboth men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, [and] brought brooches, and ear-rings, and signet-rings,\nand armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man that offered an offering of gold unto Jehovah. 23 And every man, with\nwhom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats\u2019 [hair], and rams\u2019 skins dyed red, and seal-\nskins, brought them. 24 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought Jehovah\u2019s offering; and every\nman, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it. 25 And all the women that were\nwise-hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet,\nand the fine linen. 26 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats\u2019 [hair]. 27 And the\nrulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; 28 and the spice, and\nthe oil; for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. 29 The children of Israel brought a free-\nwill-offering unto Jehovah; every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which\nJehovah had commanded to be made by Moses.\n30 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, Jehovah hath called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son\nof Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 31 And he hath filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in\nknowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; 32 and to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in\nbrass, 33 and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of skilful workmanship.\n34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.\n35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, and of the skilful\nworkman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of\nthem that do any workmanship, and of those that devise skilful works.\nExodus Chapter 36\n1 And Bezalel and Oholiab shall work, and every wise-hearted man, in whom Jehovah hath put wisdom and\nunderstanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that Jehovah hath\ncommanded. 2 And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart Jehovah had put\nwisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 3 and they received of Moses\nall the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, wherewith to\nmake it. And they brought yet unto him freewill-offerings every morning. 4 And all the wise men, that wrought all\nthe work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they wrought.\n5 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work\nwhich Jehovah commanded to make. 6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So\nthe people were restrained from bringing. 7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too\nmuch.\n8 And all the wise-hearted men among them that wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains;\nof fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman, [Bezalel]\nmade them. 9 The length of each curtain was eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits:\nall the curtains had one measure. 10 And he coupled five curtains one to another: and [the other] five curtains he\ncoupled one to another. 11 And he made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the\ncoupling: likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling. 12 Fifty loops made\nhe in the one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling: the loops\nwere opposite one to another. 13 And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the\nclasps: so the tabernacle was one.\n14 And he made curtains of goats\u2019 [hair] for a tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. 15 The\n72 Hebrew Bible\nlength of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain: the eleven curtains had one\nmeasure. 16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 17 And he made fifty loops\non the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain\nwhich was [outmost in] the second coupling. 18 And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it\nmight be one. 19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams\u2019 skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above.\n20 And he made the boards for the tabernacle, of acacia wood, standing up. 21 Ten cubits was the length of a\nboard, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board. 22 Each board had two tenons, joined one to another: thus\ndid he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 23 And he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the\nsouth side southward. 24 And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board\nfor its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 25 And for the second side of the taber-\nnacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards, 26 and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board,\nand two sockets under another board. 27 And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.\n28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part. 29 And they were double beneath;\nand in like manner they were entire unto the top thereof unto one ring: thus he did to both of them in the two cor-\nners. 30 And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets.\n31 And he made bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 32 and five bars for\nthe boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part\nwestward. 33 And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other.\n34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars\nwith gold.\n35 And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim, the work of the\nskilful workman, made he it. 36 And he made thereunto four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold: their\nhooks were of gold; And he cast for them four sockets of silver.\n37 And he made a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the\nwork of the embroiderer; 38 and the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets\nwith gold; and their five sockets were of brass.\nExodus Chapter 37\n1 And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the\nbreadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:\n2 and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about. 3 And he\ncast for it four rings of gold, in the four feet thereof; even two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other\nside of it. 4 And he made staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold. 5 And he put the staves into the rings\non the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.\n6 And he made a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half [was] the length thereof, and a cubit and a half\nthe breadth thereof. 7 And he made two cherubim of gold; of beaten work made he them, at the two ends of the\nmercy-seat; 8 one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat made he\nthe cherubim at the two ends thereof. 9 And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat\nwith their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim.\n10 And he made the table of acacia wood: two cubits [was] the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof,\nand a cubit and a half the height thereof: 11 and he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereto a crown of gold\nround about. 12 And he made unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and made a golden crown to the bor-\nder thereof round about. 13 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that were on\nthe four feet thereof. 14 Close by the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table. 15 And he made\nthe staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table. 16 And he made the vessels which were\nupon the table, the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the bowls thereof, and the flagons thereof, where-\nwith to pour out, of pure gold.\n17 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick, even its base, and its\nshaft; its cups, it knops, and its flowers, were of one piece with it: 18 and there were six branches going out of the\nsides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick\nout of the other side thereof: 19 three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower, and\nthree cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out\nof the candlestick. 20 And in the candlestick were four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the\nflowers thereof; 21 and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece\nwith it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it. 22 Their knops and\ntheir branches were of one piece with it: the whole of it was one beaten work of pure gold. 23 And he made the lamps\n73 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthereof, seven, and the snuffers thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, of pure gold. 24 Of a talent of pure gold made he\nit, and all the vessels thereof.\n25 And he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth\nthereof, foursquare; and two cubits was the height thereof; the horns thereof were of one piece with it. 26 And he\noverlaid it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: and he made\nunto it a crown of gold round about. 27 And he made for it two golden rings under the crown thereof, upon the two\nribs thereof, upon the two sides of it, for places for staves wherewith to bear it. 28 And he made the staves of acacia\nwood, and overlaid them with gold.\n29 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, after the art of the perfumer.\nExodus Chapter 38\n1 And he made the altar of burnt-offering of acacia wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the\nbreadth thereof, foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof. 2 And he made the horns thereof upon the four\ncorners of it; the horns thereof were of one piece with it: and he overlaid it with brass. 3 And he made all the vessels\nof the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, the flesh-hooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made\nhe of brass. 4 And he made for the altar a grating of network of brass, under the ledge round it beneath, reaching\nhalfway up. 5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grating of brass, to be places for the staves. 6 And he\nmade the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with brass. 7 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of\nthe altar, wherewith to bear it; he made it hollow with planks.\n8 And he made the laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, of the mirrors of the ministering women that\nministered at the door of the tent of meeting.\n9 And he made the court: for the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a\nhundred cubits; 10 their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fil-\nlets were of silver. 11 And for the north side a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass;\nthe hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver. 12 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars\nten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver. 13 And for the east side eastward fifty\ncubits. 14 The hangings for the one side [of the gate] were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three;\n15 and so for the other side: on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits; their\npillars three, and their sockets three. 16 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen. 17 And\nthe sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver; and the overlaying of their\ncapitals, of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. 18 And the screen for the gate of the court\nwas the work of the embroiderer, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the\nlength, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court. 19 And their pillars\nwere four, and their sockets four, of brass; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals, and their fillets,\nof silver. 20 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.\n21 This is the sum of [the things for] the tabernacle, even the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were counted,\naccording to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron\nthe priest. 22 And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that Jehovah commanded\nMoses. 23 And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skilful work-\nman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in fine linen. 24 All the gold that was used for\nthe work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hun-\ndred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the con-\ngregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel\nof the sanctuary: 26 a beka a head, [that is], half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that passed\nover to them that were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand\nand five hundred and fifty men. 27 And the hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary,\nand the sockets of the veil; a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 28 And of the thousand\nseven hundred seventy and five [shekels] he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and made fillets\nfor them. 29 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels. 30 And\ntherewith he made the sockets to the door of the tent of meeting, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grating for it,\nand all the vessels of the altar, 31 and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the gate of the court,\nand all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.\nExodus Chapter 39\n1 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place,\nand made the holy garments for Aaron; as Jehovah commanded Moses. 2 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and\n74 Hebrew Bible\npurple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 3 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work\nit in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skilful workman. 4 They\nmade shoulder-pieces for it, joined together; at the two ends was it joined together. 5 And the skilfully woven band,\nthat was upon it, wherewith to gird it on, was of the same piece [and] like the work thereof; of gold, of blue, and\npurple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as Jehovah commanded Moses.\n6 And they wrought the onyx stones, inclosed in settings of gold, graven with the engravings of a signet, accord-\ning to the names of the children of Israel. 7 And he put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of\nmemorial for the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses.\n8 And he made the breastplate, the work of the skilful workman, like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue,\nand purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 9 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was\nthe length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being double. 10 And they set in it four rows of stones. A row of\nsardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row; 11 and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond; 12 and\nthe third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 13 and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jaspar: they were\ninclosed in inclosings of gold in their settings. 14 And the stones were according to the names of the children of Isra-\nel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve\ntribes. 15 And they made upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold. 16 And they made\ntwo settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 17 And they put\nthe two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. 18 And the [other] two ends of the\ntwo wreathen chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in the fore-\npart thereof. 19 And they made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge\nthereof, which was toward the side of the ephod inward. 20 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the\ntwo shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skil-\nfully woven band of the ephod. 21 And they did bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod\nwith a lace of blue, that it might be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not\nbe loosed from the ephod; as Jehovah commanded Moses.\n22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. 23 And the hole of the robe in the midst\nthereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent. 24 And\nthey made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, [and] twined [linen]. 25 And\nthey made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about,\nbetween the pomegranates; 26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round\nabout, to minister in; as Jehovah commanded Moses.\n27 And they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, 28 and the mitre of fine\nlinen, and the goodly head-tires of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen, 29 and the girdle of fine\ntwined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer; as Jehovah commanded Moses.\n30 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of\na signet, HOLY TO JEHOVAH. 31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre above; as Jehovah\ncommanded Moses.\n32 Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting: and the children of Israel did accord-\ning to all that Jehovah commanded Moses; so did they.\n33 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, it bars, and\nits pillars, and it sockets; 34 and the covering of rams\u2019 skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, and the veil of\nthe screen; 35 the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy-seat; 36 the table, all the vessels thereof,\nand the showbread; 37 the pure candlestick, the lamps thereof, even the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels\nthereof, and the oil for the light; 38 and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen\nfor the door of the Tent; 39 the brazen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its\nbase; 40 the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords there-\nof, and the pins thereof, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting; 41 the finely\nwrought garments for ministering in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments\nof his sons, to minister in the priest\u2019s office. 42 According to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of\nIsrael did all the work. 43 And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as Jehovah had commanded,\neven so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.\nExodus Chapter 40\n1 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, 2 On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle\nof the tent of meeting. 3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the\nveil. 4 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are upon it; and thou shalt bring in the can-\n75 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ndlestick, and light the lamps thereof. 5 And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimo-\nny, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 6 And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door\nof the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. 7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar,\nand shalt put water therein. 8 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of\nthe court. 9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow\nit, and all the furniture thereof: and it shall be holy. 10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its\nvessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar shall be most holy. 11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and\nsanctify it. 12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them\nwith water. 13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that\nhe may minister unto me in the priest\u2019s office. 14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them; 15 and thou\nshalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest\u2019s office: and their\nanointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.\n16 Thus did Moses: according to all that Jehovah commanded him, so did he.\n17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle\nwas reared up. 18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in\nthe bars thereof, and reared up its pillars. 19 And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the\ntent above upon it; as Jehovah commanded Moses.\n20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above\nupon the ark: 21 and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of\nthe testimony; as Jehovah commanded Moses.\n22 And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil.\n23 And he set the bread in order upon it before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.\n24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle south-\nward. 25 And he lighted the lamps before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.\n26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil: 27 and he burnt thereon incense of sweet\nspices; as Jehovah commanded Moses.\n28 And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle. 29 And he set the altar of burnt-offering at the door of the\ntabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering; as Jehovah com-\nmanded Moses.\n30 And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, wherewith to wash.\n31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat; 32 when they went into the tent of\nmeeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as Jehovah commanded Moses. 33 And he reared up\nthe court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished\nthe work.\n34 Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle. 35 And Moses was\nnot able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tab-\nernacle. 36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, through-\nout all their journeys: 37 but if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.\n38 For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the\nhouse of Israel, throughout all their journeys.\nTHE EpIC oF GILGAMESH\nOral and written versions between ca. 2500-1400 B.C.E.\nSumer\/Babylon\nThe story of Gilgamesh survives as the oldest epic in literature because it was preserved by rival societies in\nancient Mesopotamia. The Sumerian story of this king of Uruk (modern day Warka in Iraq), who reigned around\napproximately 2700 B.C.E., was retold and rewritten by Babylonian, Assyrian, and Hittite scribes. The Standard\nVersion, which modern scholars attribute to an Assyrian scribe\/priest, combines many of the previous oral and\nwritten variants of the tale. The version of the epic presented here is a compilation of the Standard Version (which\ncontains gaps where the tablets are damaged) and a variety of Assyrian, Babylonian, and Hittite versions that were\ndiscovered later. In the story, Gilgamesh (who is two-thirds divine and one-third human, a marvel of modern\ngenetics) initially befriends Enkidu (also engineered by the gods) and then goes on a quest for immortality when he\nrealizes that even semi-divine beings must die. Kept in the library of the Assyrian King Assurbanipal, the twelve\nclay tablets with the Standard Version were accidentally saved when, during the sack of Nineveh in 612 B.C.E., the\n76 The Epic of Gilgamesh\nwalls of the library were caved in on the tablets. Archeologists discovered the eleventh tablet in the mid-1800s,\nwhich contains an account of the flood story that pre-dates the written version of the Biblical account of Noah,\nleading to the recovery of all twelve tablets, plus additional fragments. In 2003, in Warka, they found what is\nbelieved to be the tomb of Gilgamesh himself.\nSumerian\/Babylonian Gods:\n\u2022 An (Babylonian: Anu): god of heaven; may have\nbeen the main god before 2500 B.C.E.\n\u2022 ninhursag (Babylonian: Aruru, Mammi): moth-\ner goddess; created the gods with An; assists in\ncreation of man.\n\u2022 Enlil (Babylonian: Ellil): god of air; pantheon\nleader from 2500 B.C.E.; \u201cfather\u201d of the gods be-\ncause he is in charge (although An\/Anu is actually\nthe father of many of them); king of heaven &\nearth.\n\u2022 Enki (Babylonian: Ea): lord of the abyss and wis-\ndom; god of water, creation, and fertility.\n\u2022 nanna (Babylonian: Sin): moon god.\n\u2022 Inanna (Babylonian: Ishtar): goddess of love,\nwar, and fertility.\n\u2022 Utu (Babylonian: Shamash): god of the sun and\nImage 1.7: The Flood Tablet | An original stone tablet,\njustice.\nTablet 11, from the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n\u2022 ninlil (Babylonian: Mullitu, Mylitta): bride of\nAuthor: User \u201cBabelStone\u201d\nEnlil.\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC0 1.0\nWritten by Laura J.

The shepherds\nGathered at the sight of him.\nHe in the past was accustomed to suck the milk of the wild things!\nBread which she set before him he broke, but he gazed and he stared:\nEnkidu did not know how to eat bread, nor had he the knowledge to drink mead! 205\nThen the woman made answer, to Enkidu speaking,\n\u201cEnkidu, taste of the bread, for it is life; in truth, the essential of life;\nDrink also of the mead, which is the custom of the country.\u201d\nEnkidu ate the bread, ate until he was gorged,\nDrank of the mead seven cups; his spirits rose, and he was exultant, 210\nGlad was his heart, and cheerful his face:\nHe anointed himself with oil: and thus became human.\nHe put on a garment to be like a man and taking his weapons,\nHe hunted the lions, which harried the shepherds all the nights, and he caught the jackals.\nHe, having mastered the lions, let the shepherds sleep soundly. 215\nEnkidu\u2014he was their guardian\u2014became a man of full vigor.\nEnkidu saw a man passing by, and when he observed the fellow,\nHe said to the woman: \u201cShamhat, bring me this fellow,\nWhere is he going? I would know his intention.\u201d\nShamhat called to the man to come to them, asking: \u201cO, what are you seeking, Sir?\u201d 220\nThe man spoke, addressing them:\n\u201cI am going, then, to heap up the offerings such as are due to the city of Uruk;\nCome with me, and on behalf of the common good bring in the food of the city.\nYou will see Gilgamesh, king of broad-marketed Uruk;\nAfter the wedding, he sleeps first with the bride, his birthright, before the husband.\u201d 225\nSo, at the words of the fellow, they went with him to Uruk.\nEnkidu, going in front with the temple girl coming behind him,\nEntered broad-marketed Uruk; the populace gathered behind him,\n82 The Epic of Gilgamesh\nThen, as he stopped in the street of broad-marketed Uruk, the people\nThronging behind him exclaimed \u201cOf a truth, like to Gilgamesh is he, 230\nShorter in stature, but his composition is stronger.\u201d\nStrewn is the couch for the love-rites, and Gilgamesh now in the night-time\nComes to sleep, to delight in the woman, but Enkidu, standing\nThere in the street, blocks the passage to Gilgamesh, threatening\nGilgamesh with his strength. 235\nGilgamesh shows his rage, and he rushed to attack him: they met in the street.\nEnkidu barred up the door with his foot, and to Gilgamesh denied entry.\nThey grappled and snorted like bulls, and the threshold of the door\nShattered: the very wall quivered as Gilgamesh with Enkidu grappled and wrestled.\nGilgamesh bent his leg to the ground [pinning Enkidu]: so his fury abated, 240\nAnd his anger was quelled: Enkidu thus to Gilgamesh spoke:\n\u201cOf a truth, did your mother (Ninsun, the wild cow goddess) bear you,\nAnd only you: that choicest cow of the steer-folds,\nNinsun exalted you above all heroes, and Enlil has given\nYou the kingship over men.\u201d 245\n[The next part of the story is lost on a broken part of the tablet.

Each clasped the hand of the other.\nHolding on to each other like brothers, and Enkidu answered Gilgamesh:\n\u201cFriend, my darling has circled her arms around my neck to say goodbye, 250\nWhich is why my arms lose their power, my body has lost its strength.\u201d\n[Gilgamesh decides to distract his friend with a quest.]\nGilgamesh opened his mouth, and to Enkidu he spoke in this way:\n\u201cI, my friend, am determined to go to the Forest of Cedars,\nHumbaba the Fierce lives there, I will overcome and destroy what is evil,\nThen will I cut down the Cedar trees.\u201d 255\nEnkidu opened his mouth, and to Gilgamesh he spoke in this way,\n\u201cKnow, then, my friend, that when I was roaming with the animals in the mountains\nI marched for a distance of two hours from the skirts of the Forest\nInto its depths.

A god, certainly,\nLives forever in the daylight, but mortals\u2014their days are all numbered,\nAll that they do is but wind\u2014But since you are now dreading death, 275\nOffering nothing of your courage\u2014I, I\u2019ll be your protector, marching in front of you!\nYour own mouth shall tell others that you feared the onslaught of battle,\nWhereas I, if I should fall, will have established my name forever.\nIt was Gilgamesh who fought with Humbaba, the Fierce!\nIn the future, after my children are born to my house, and climb up into your lap, saying: 280\n\u2018Tell us all that you know,\u2019 [what shall you say]?\nWhen you talk this way, you make me long for the Cedars even more;\nI am determined to cut them down, so that I may gain fame everlasting.\u201d\nGilgamesh spoke again to Enkidu, saying:\n\u201cNow, O my friend, I must give my orders to the craftsmen, 285\nSo that they cast in our presence our weapons.\u201d\nThey delivered the orders to the craftsmen: the mold did the workmen prepare, and the axes\nMonstrous they cast: yes, the axes did they cast, each weighing three talents;\nGlaives, too, monstrous they cast, with hilts each weighing two talents,\nBlades, thirty manas to each, corresponding to fit them: the inlay, 290\nGold thirty manas each sword: so were Gilgamesh and Enkidu laden\nEach with ten talents of weight.\nAnd now in the Seven Bolt Portal of Uruk\nHearing the noise did the artisans gather, assembled the people,\nThere in the streets of broad-marketed Uruk, in Gilgamesh\u2019s honor, 295\nSo did the Elders of Uruk the broad-marketed take seat before him.\nGilgamesh spoke thus: \u201cO Elders of Uruk the broad-marketed, hear me!\nI go against Humbaba, the Fierce, who shall say, when he hears that I am coming,\n\u2018Ah, let me look on this Gilgamesh, he of whom people are speaking,\nHe with whose fame the countries are filled\u2019\u2014\u2019Then I will overwhelm him, 300\nThere in the Forest of Cedars\u2014I\u2019ll make the land hear it,\nHow like a giant the hero of Uruk is\u2014yes, for I am determined to cut down the Cedars\nSo that I may gain fame everlasting.\u201d\nTo Gilgamesh the Elders of Uruk the broad-marketed gave this answer:\n\u201cGilgamesh, it is because you are young that your valor makes you too confident, 305\nNor do you know to the full what you seek to accomplish.\nNews has come to our ears of Humbaba, who is twice the size of a man.\nWho of free will then would seek to oppose him or encounter his weapons?\nWho would march for two hours from the skirts of the Forest\nInto its depths? Humbaba, his roar is a whirlwind, 310\nFlame is in his jaws, and his very breath is Death! O, why have you desired to accomplish this?\nTo fight with Humbaba would be an unequal conflict.\u201d\nGilgamesh listened to the advice of his counselors and pondered,\nThen cried out to his friend: \u201cNow, indeed, O my friend, will I voice my opinion.\nIn truth, I dread him, and yet into the depths of the Forest I will go.\u201d 315\nAnd the Elders spoke:\n\u201cGilgamesh, put not your faith in the strength of your own person solely,\nAnd do not trust your fighting skills too much.\nTruly, he who walks in front is able to safeguard a comrade,\n84 The Epic of Gilgamesh\nYour guide will guard you; so, let Enkidu walk in front of you, 320\nFor he knows the road to the Forest of Cedars;\nHe lusts for battle, and threatens combat.\nEnkidu\u2014he would watch over a friend, would safeguard a comrade,\nYes, such a man would deliver his friend from out of the pitfalls.\nWe, O King, in our conclave have paid close attention to your welfare; 325\nYou, O King, shall pay attention to us in return.\u201d\nGilgamesh opened his mouth and spoke to Enkidu, saying:\n\u201cTo the Palace of Splendor, O friend, come, let us go,\nTo the presence of Ninsun, the glorious Queen, yes, to Ninsun,\nWisest of all clever women, all-knowing; she will tell us how to proceed.\u201d 330\nThey joined hands and went to the Palace of Splendor,\nGilgamesh and Enkidu. To the glorious Queen, yes, to Ninsun\nGilgamesh came, and he entered into her presence:\n\u201cNinsun, I want you to know that I am going on a long journey,\nTo the home of Humbaba to encounter a threat that is unknown, 335\nTo follow a road which I know not, which will be new from the time of my starting,\nUntil my return, until I arrive at the Forest of Cedars,\nUntil I overthrow Humbaba, the Fierce, and destroy him.\nThe Sun god abhors all evil things, Shamash hates evil; Ask him to help us.\u201d\nSo Ninsun listened to her offspring, to Gilgamesh, 340\nEntered her chamber and decked herself with the flowers of Tulal,\nPut the festival clothes on her body,\nPut on the festival adornments of her bosom, her head with a circlet crowned,\nClimbed the stairway, ascended to the roof, and the parapet mounted,\nOffered her incense to Shamash, her sacrifice offered to Shamash, 345\nThen towards Shamash she lifted her hands in prayer, saying:\n\u201cWhy did you give this restlessness of spirit to Gilgamesh, my son?\nYou gave him restlessness, and now he wants to go on a long journey\nTo where Humbaba dwells, to encounter a threat that is unknown,\nTo follow a road which he knows not, which will be new from the time of his starting, 350\nUntil his return, until he arrives at the Forest of Cedars,\nUntil he overthrows Humbaba, the Fierce, and destroys him.\nYou abhor all evil things; you hate evil. Remember my son when that day comes,\nWhen he faces Humbaba. May Aya, your bride, remind you of my son.\u201d\nNow Gilgamesh knelt before Shamash, to utter a prayer; tears streamed down his face: 355\n\u201cHere I present myself, Shamash, to lift up my hands in entreaty\nThat my life may be spared; bring me again to the ramparts of Uruk:\nGive me your protection. I will give you homage.\u201d\nAnd Shamash made answer, speaking through his oracle.\n[Although the next lines are missing, Shamash evidently gives his permission, so Gilgamesh and Enkidu get ready for\ntheir journey.]\nThe artisans brought monstrous axes, they delivered the bow and the quiver 360\nInto his hand; so, taking an ax, he slung on his quiver,\nHe fastened his glaive to his baldrick.\nBut before the two of them set forth on their journey, they offered\nGifts to the Sun god, that he might bring them home to Uruk in safety.\nNow the Elders give their blessings, to Gilgamesh giving 365\nCounsel concerning the road: \u201cO Gilgamesh, do not trust to your own power alone,\n85 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nGuard yourself; let Enkidu walk in front of you for protection.\nHe is the one who discovered the way, the road he has traveled.\nTruly, all the paths of the Forest are under the watchful eye of Humbaba.\nMay the Sun god grant you success to attain your ambition, 370\nMay he level the path that is blocked, cleave a road through the forest for you to walk.\nMay the god Lugalbanda bring dreams to you, ones that shall make you glad,\nSo that they help you achieve your purpose, for like a boy\nYou have fixed your mind to the overthrow of Humbaba.\nWhen you stop for the night, dig a well, so that the water in your skin-bottle 375\nWill be pure, will be cool;\nPour out an offering of water to the Sun god, and do not forget Lugalbanda.\u201d\nGilgamesh drew his mantle around his shoulders,\nAnd they set forth together on the road to Humbaba.\nEvery forty leagues they took a meal; 380\nEvery sixty leagues they took a rest.\nGilgamesh walked to the summit and poured out his offering for the mountain:\n\u201cMountain, grant me a dream. . .\u201d\nThe mountain granted him a dream. . .\nThen a chill gust of wind made him sway like the corn of the mountains; 385\nStraightaway, sleep that flows on man descended upon him: at midnight\nHe suddenly ended his slumber and hurried to speak to his comrade:\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you call me, O friend? Why am I awakened from slumber?\nDidn\u2019t you touch me\u2014or has some spirit passed by me? Why do I tremble?\u201d\n[Gilgamesh\u2019s dream is terrifying, but Enkidu interprets it to mean that Shamash will help them defeat Humbaba.\nThis process is repeated several times. Eventually, they arrive at the huge gate that guards the Cedar Forest.]\nEnkidu lifted his eyes and spoke to the Gate as if it were human: 390\n\u201cO Gate of the Forest, I for the last forty leagues have admired your wonderful timber,\nYour wood has no peer in other countries;\nSix gar your height, and two gar your breadth . . .\nO, if I had but known, O Gate, of your grandeur,\nThen I would lift an ax\u2026[basically, I would have brought a bigger ax]. 395\n[The heroes force the gate open.]\nThey stood and stared at the Forest, they gazed at the height of the Cedars,\nScanning the paths into the Forest: and where Humbaba walked\nWas a path: paths were laid out and well kept.\nThey saw the cedar hill, the dwelling of gods, the sanctuary of Ishtar.\nIn front of the hill a cedar stood of great splendor, 400\nFine and good was its shade, filling the heart with gladness.\n[From his words below, Humbaba must have taunted the heroes at this point, and Gilgamesh is preparing to attack\nHumbaba.]\nThe Sung god saw Gilgamesh through the branches of the Cedar trees:\nGilgamesh prayed to the Sun god for help.\nThe Sun god heard the entreaty of Gilgamesh,\nAnd against Humbaba he raised mighty winds: yes, a great wind, 405\nWind from the North, a wind from the South, a tempest and storm wind,\nChill wind, and whirlwind, a wind of all harm: eight winds he raised,\nSeizing Humbaba from the front and the back, so that he could not go forwards,\nNor was he able to go back: and then Humbaba surrendered.\nHumbaba spoke to Gilgamesh this way: \u201cO Gilgamesh, I pray you, 410\nStay now your hand: be now my master, and I\u2019ll be your henchman:\nDisregard all the words which I spoke so boastfully against you.\u201d\nThen Enkidu spoke to Gilgamesh: \u201cOf the advice which Humbaba\nGives to you\u2014you cannot risk accepting it.\nHumbaba must not remain alive.\u201d 420\n[The section where they debate what to do is missing, but several versions have the end result.]\n86 The Epic of Gilgamesh\nThey cut off the head of Humbaba and left the corpse to be devoured by vultures.\n[They return to Uruk after cutting down quite a few cedar trees.]\nGilgamesh cleansed his weapons, he polished his arms.\nHe took off the armor that was upon him. He put away\nHis soiled garments and put on clean clothes;\nHe covered himself with his ornaments, put on his baldrick. 425\nGilgamesh placed upon his head the crown.\nTo win the favor and love of Gilgamesh, Ishtar, the lofty goddess, desired him and said:\n\u201cCome, Gilgamesh, be my spouse,\nGive, O give to me your manly strength.\nBe my husband, let me be your wife, 430\nAnd I will set you in a chariot embossed with precious stones and gold,\nWith wheels made of gold, and shafts of sapphires.\nLarge kudanu-lions you shall harness to it.\nUnder sweet-smelling cedars you shall enter into our house.\nAnd when you enter into our house 435\nYou shall sit upon a lofty throne, and people shall kiss your feet;\nKings and lords and rulers shall bow down before you.\nWhatever the mountain and the countryside produces, they shall bring to you as tribute.\nYour sheep shall bear twin-ewes.\nYou shall sit upon a chariot that is splendid, 440\ndrawn by a team that has no equal.\u201d\nGilgamesh opened his mouth in reply, said to Lady Ishtar:\n\u201cYes, but what could I give you, if I should take you in marriage?\nI could provide you with oils for your body, and clothing: also,\nI could give you bread and other foods: there must be enough sustenance 445\nFit for divinity\u2014I, too, must give you a drink fit for royalty.\nWhat, then, will be my advantage, supposing I take you in marriage?\nYou are but a ruin that gives no shelter to man from the weather,\nYou are but a back door that gives no resistance to blast or to windstorm,\nYou are but a palace that collapses on the heroes within it, 450\nYou are but a pitfall with a covering that gives way treacherously,\nYou are but pitch that defiles the man who carries it,\nYou are but a bottle that leaks on him who carries it,\nYou are but limestone that lets stone ramparts fall crumbling in ruin.\nYou are but a sandal that causes its owner to trip. 455\nWho was the husband you faithfully loved for all time?\nWho was your lord who gained the advantage over you?\nCome, and I will tell you the endless tale of your husbands.\nWhere is your husband Tammuz, who was to be forever?\nWell, I will tell you plainly the dire result of your behavior. 460\nTo Tammuz, the husband of your youth,\nYou caused weeping and brought grief upon him every year.\n[She sent Tammuz to the Underworld in her place, not telling him that he would only be able to return in the spring,\nlike Persephone\/Proserpina.]\nThe allallu-bird, so bright of colors, you loved;\nBut its wing you broke and crushed,\nso that now it sits in the woods crying: \u2018O my wing!\u2019 465\nYou also loved a lion, powerful in his strength;\nSeven and seven times did you dig a snaring pit for him.\nYou also loved a horse, pre-eminent in battle,\nBut with bridle, spur, and whip you forced it on,\nForced it to run seven double-leagues at a stretch. 470\nAnd when it was tired and wanted to drink, you still forced it on,\n87 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nCausing weeping and grief to its mother, Si-li-li.\nYou also loved a shepherd of the flock\nWho continually poured out incense before you,\nAnd who, for your pleasure, slaughtered lambs day by day. 475\nYou smote him, and turned him into a tiger,\nSo that his own sheep-boys drove him away,\nAnd his own dogs tore him to pieces.\nYou also loved a gardener of your father,\nWho continually brought you delicacies, 480\nAnd daily adorned your table for you.\nYou cast your eye on him, saying:\n\u2018O Ishullanu of mine, come, let me taste of your vigor,\nLet us enjoy your manhood.\u2019\nBut he, Ishullanu, said to you \u2018What are you asking of me? 485\nI have only eaten what my mother has baked, [he is pure]\nAnd what you would give me would be bread of transgression, [she is not]\nYes, and iniquity! Furthermore, when are thin reeds a cloak against winter?\u2019\nYou heard his answer and smote him and make him a spider,\nMaking him lodge midway up the wall of a dwelling\u2014not to move upwards 490\nIn case there might be water draining from the roof; nor down, to avoid being crushed.\nSo, too, would you love me and then treat me like them.\u201d\nWhen Ishtar heard such words, she became enraged, and went up into heaven,\nand came unto Anu [her father], and to Antum [her mother] she went, and spoke to them:\n\u201cMy father, Gilgamesh has insulted me; 495\nGilgamesh has upbraided me with my evil deeds,\nMy deeds of evil and of violence.\u201d\nAnd Anu opened his mouth and spoke\u2014\nSaid unto her, the mighty goddess Ishtar:\n\u201cYou asked him to grant you the fruit of his body; 500\nTherefore, he told you the tale of your deeds of evil and violence.\u201d\nIshtar said to Anu, her father:\n\u201cFather, O make me a Heavenly Bull, which shall defeat Gilgamesh,\nFill its body with flame . . . .\nBut if you will not make this Bull\u2026 505\nI will smite [the gates of the Underworld], break it down and release the ghosts,\nWho shall then be more numerous than the living:\nMore than the living will be the dead.\u201d\nAnu answered Ishtar, the Lady:\n\u201cIf I create the Heavenly Bull, for which you ask me, 510\nThen seven years of famine will follow after his attack.\nHave you gathered corn enough, and enough fodder for the cattle?\u201d\nIshtar made answer, saying to Anu, her father:\n\u201cCorn for mankind have I hoarded, have grown fodder for the cattle.\u201d\n[After this a hundred men attack the Bull, but with his fiery breath he annihilates them. Two hundred men then attack\nthe Bull with the same result, and then three hundred more are overcome.]\nEnkidu girded his middle; and straightway Enkidu, leaping, 515\nSeized the Heavenly Bull by his horns, and headlong before him\nCast down the Heavenly Bull his full length.\n88 The Epic of Gilgamesh\n[On an old Babylonian cylinder that depicts the fight, we see the Heavenly Bull standing on its hind feet, Enkidu\nholding the monster by its head and tail, while Gilgamesh plunges\nthe dagger into its heart.]\nThen Ishtar went up to the wall of Uruk, the strong-walled;\nShe uttered a piercing cry and broke out into a curse, saying:\n\u201cWoe to Gilgamesh, who thus has grieved me, and has killed the Heavenly Bull.\u201d 520\nBut Enkidu, hearing these words of Ishtar, tore out the right side of the Heavenly Bull,\nAnd threw it into her face, saying:\n\u201cI would do to you what I have done to him;\nTruly, I would hang the entrails on you like a girdle.\u201d\nThen Ishtar gathered her followers, the temple girls, 525\nThe hierodules, and the sacred prostitutes.\nOver the right side of the Heavenly Bull she wept and lamented.\nBut Gilgamesh assembled the people, and all his workmen.\nThe workmen admired the size of its horns.\nThirty minas of precious stones was their value; 530\nHalf of an inch in size was their thickness.\nSix measures of oil they both could hold.\nHe dedicated it for the anointing of his god Lugalbanda.\nHe brought the horns and hung them up in the shrine of his lordship.\nThen they washed their hands in the river Euphrates, 535\nTook the road, and set out for the city,\nAnd rode through the streets of the city of Uruk.\nThe people of Uruk assembled and looked with astonishment at the heroes.\nGilgamesh then spoke to the servants of his palace\nAnd cried out to them, saying: \u201cWho is the most glorious among the heroes? 540\nWho shines among the men?\u201d \u201cGilgamesh is the most glorious among the heroes,\nGilgamesh shines among the men!\u201d\nAnd Gilgamesh held a joyful feast in his palace. Then the heroes slept on their couches.\nAnd Enkidu slept, and saw a vision in his sleep. He arose and spoke to Gilgamesh in this way:\n\u201cMy friend, why have the great gods sat in counsel? 545\nGilgamesh, hear the dream which I saw in the night: said Enlil, Ea, and the Sun-god of heaven,\n\u2018They have killed the Heavenly Bull and smote Humbaba, who guarded the cedars.\u2019 Enlil said: \u2018Enkidu shall die: but\nGilgamesh shall not die. O Sun god, you helped them slay the Heavenly Bull and Humbaba. But now Enkidu shall\ndie. Did you think it right to help them? You move among them like a mortal [although you are a god].\u2019\u201d 550\n[The gods give Enkidu a fever. Enkidu curses the temple girl for bringing him to Uruk.]\n\u201cO hetaera, I will decree a terrible fate for you\u2014your woes shall never end for all eternity. Come, I will curse thee\nwith a bitter curse: may there never be satisfaction of your desires\u2014and may disaster befall your house, may the\ngutters of the street be your dwelling, may the shade of the wall be your abode\u2014may scorching heat and thirst\ndestroy your strength.\u201d\nThe Sun god heard him, and opened his mouth, and from out of the heavens 555\nHe called him: \u201cO Enkidu, why do you curse the hetaera?\nIt was she who made you eat bread fit for the gods: yes, wine too,\nShe made you drink, fit for royalty: a generous mantle\nShe put on you, and she gave you Gilgamesh, a splendid comrade.\nHe will give you a magnificent funeral, 560\nSo that the gods of the Underworld will kiss your feet in their homage;\nHe, too, will make all the people of Uruk lament in your honor,\nMaking them mourn you, and damsels and heroes weep at your funeral,\n89 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nWhile he himself for your sake will cover himself in dust,\nAnd he will put on the skin of a lion and range over the desert.\u201d 565\nEnkidu listened to the words of the valiant Shamash,\nAnd when the Sun god finished speaking, Enkidu\u2019s wrath was appeased.\n\u201cHetaera, I call back my curse, and I will restore you to your place with blessings!\nMay monarchs and princes and chiefs fall in love with you;\nAnd for you may the hero comb out his locks; whoever would embrace you, 570\nLet him open his money pouch, and let your bed be azure and golden;\nMay he entreat you kindly, let him heap treasure before you;\nMay you enter into the presence of the gods;\nMay you be the mother of seven brides.\u201d\nEnkidu said to Gilgamesh: 575\n\u201cFriend, a dream I have seen in my night-time: the sky was thundering,\nIt echoed over the earth, and I by myself was standing,\nWhen I perceived a man, all dark was his face,\nAnd his nails were like the claws of a lion.\nHe overcome me, pressed me down, and he seized me, 580\nHe led me to the Dwelling of Darkness, the home of Ereshkigal, Queen of the Underworld,\nTo the Dwelling from which he who enters it never comes forth!\nBy the road on which there can be no returning,\nTo the Dwelling whose tenants are always bereft of the daylight,\nWhere for their food is the dust, and the mud is their sustenance: bird-like, 585\nThey wear a garment of feathers: and, sitting there in the darkness,\nNever see the light.\nThose who had worn crowns, who of old ruled over the country,\nThey were the servants of Anu and Enlil who carried in the food,\nServed cool water from the skins. When I entered 590\nInto this House of the Dust, High Priest and acolyte were sitting there,\nSeer and magician, the priest who the Sea of the great gods anointed,\nHere sat Etana the hero, the Queen of the Underworld also,\nEreshkigal, in whose presence sat the Scribe of the Underworld,\nBelit-seri, and read before her; she lifted her head and beheld me [and I awoke in terror].\u201d 595\nAnd there lay Enkidu for twelve days; for twelve days he lay on his couch before he died.\nGilgamesh wept bitterly over the loss of his friend, and he lay on the ground, saying:\n\u201cI am not dying, but weeping has entered into my heart;\nFear of death has befallen me, and I lie here stretched out upon the ground.\nListen to me, O Elders; I weep for my comrade Enkidu, 600\nBitterly crying like a wailing woman: my grip is slackened on my ax,\nFor I have been assailed by sorrow and cast down in affliction.\u201d\n\u201cComrade and henchman, Enkidu\u2014what is this slumber that has overcome you?\nWhy are your eyes dark, why can you not hear me?\u201d\nBut he did not raise his eyes, and his heart, when Gilgamesh felt it, made no beat. 605\nThen he covered his friend with a veil like a bride;\nLifted his voice like a lion,\nRoared like a lioness robbed of her whelps. In front of his comrade\nHe paced backwards and forwards, tearing his hair and casting away his finery,\nPlucking and casting away all the grace of his person. 610\nThen when morning began to dawn, Gilgamesh said:\n90 The Epic of Gilgamesh\n\u201cFriend, I will give you a magnificent funeral,\nSo that the gods of the Underworld will kiss your feet in their homage;\nI will make all the people of Uruk lament in your honor,\nMaking them mourn you, and damsels and heroes weep at your funeral, 615\nWhile I myself for your sake will cover myself in dust,\nAnd I will put on the skin of a lion and range over the desert.\u201d\nGilgamesh brought out also a mighty platter of wood from the highlands.\nHe filled a bowl of bright ruby with honey; a bowl too of azure\nHe filled with cream, for the gods. 620\nGilgamesh wept bitterly for his comrade, for Enkidu, ranging\nOver the desert: \u201cI, too\u2014shall I not die like Enkidu also?\nSorrow hath entered my heart; I fear death as I range over the desert,\nSo I will take the road to the presence of Utnapishtim, the offspring of Ubara-Tutu;\nAnd with speed will I travel.\u201d 625\nIn darkness he arrived at the Gates of the Mountains,\nAnd he met with lions, terror falling on him; he lifted his head skywards,\nOffered his prayer to the Moon god, Sin:\n\u201cO deliver me!\u201d He took his ax in his hand and drew his glaive from his baldric,\nHe leapt among them, smiting and crushing, and they were defeated. 630\nAs he reached the Mountains of Mashu,\nWhere every day they keep watch over the Sun god\u2019s rising and setting,\nThe peaks rise up to the Zenith of Heaven, and downwards\nDeep into the Underworld reach their roots: and there at their portals stand sentry\nScorpion-men, awful in terror, their very glance Death: and tremendous, 635\nShaking the hills, their magnificence; they are the Wardens of Shamash,\nBoth at his rising and setting. No sooner did Gilgamesh see them\nThan from alarm and dismay was his face stricken with pallor,\nSenseless, he groveled before them.\nThen to his wife spoke the Scorpion: 640\n\u201cLook, he that comes to us\u2014his body is the flesh of the gods.\u201d\nThen his wife answered to the Scorpion-man: \u201cTwo parts of him are god-like;\nOne third of him is human.\u201d\n[Gilgamesh explains why he is searching for Utnapishtim; it is a journey that no one else has ever taken, but the Scorpi-\non-Man agrees to let him take the Road of the Sun\u2014a tunnel that passes through the mountain. For twenty four hours,\nGilgamesh travels in darkness, emerging into the Garden of the Gods, filled with fruit trees.

I will smite your gate,\nBreaking the bolt.\u201d\nThe Wine-maker, speaking to Gilgamesh, answered him, saying:\n\u201cWhy is your vigor so wasted, why is your face sunken,\nWhy does your spirit have such sorrow, and why has your cheerfulness ceased? 670\nO, but there\u2019s woe in your belly! Like one who has gone on a far journey\nIs your face\u2014O, with cold and with heat is your face weathered,\nLike a man who has ranged over the desert.\u201d\nGilgamesh answered the Wine-maker, saying:\n\u201cWine-maker, it is not that my vigor is wasted, nor that my face is sunken, 675\nNor that my spirit has sorrow, nor that my cheerfulness has ceased,\nNo, it is not that there is woe in my belly, nor that my face is like one\nWho has gone on a far journey\u2014nor is my face weathered\nEither by cold or by heat as I range over the desert.\nEnkidu\u2014together we overcame all obstacles, ascending the mountains, 680\nCaptured the Heavenly Bull, and destroyed him: we overthrew Humbaba,\nHe whose abode was in the Forest of Cedars; we slaughtered the lions\nThere in the mountain passes; with me enduring all hardships,\nEnkidu, he was my comrade\u2014and his fate has overtaken him.\nI mourned him six days, until his burial; only then could I bury him. 685\nI dreaded Death, so that I now range over the desert: the fate of my comrade\nLay heavy on me\u2014O, how do I give voice to what I feel?\nFor the comrade I have so loved has become like dust,\nHe whom I loved has become like the dust\u2014I, shall I not, also,\nLay me down like him, throughout all eternity never to return?\u201d 690\nThe Wine-maker answered Gilgamesh:\n\u201cGilgamesh, why do you run so far, since the life that you seek\nYou shall not find?

Rough is the passage,\nAnd deep are the Waters of Death when you reach them. 710\nGilgamesh, if by chance you succeed in crossing the Ocean,\nWhat will you do, when you arrive at the Waters of Death?\nGilgamesh, there is a man called Urshanabi, boatman to Utnapishtim,\nHe has the urnu for the crossing,\nNow go to him, and if it is possible to cross with him 715\nThen cross\u2014but if it is not possible, then retrace your steps homewards.\u201d\nGilgamesh, hearing this, took his ax in his hand and went to see Urshanabi.\n[Evidently, Gilgamesh is not thinking too clearly, since he displays his strength to Urshanabi by destroying the sails of\nthe boat.

But my heart has still to struggle\nAgainst all the obstacles that no longer bother you.\nTell me, how did you come to dwell here and obtain eternal life from the gods?\u201d 795\n[In the following passages, Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the story of the flood. In the story of Atrahasis, another name\nfor Utnapishtim, the reason for the flood is that humans have been too noisy and the gods cannot sleep. The gods use\nthe flood as a way to deal with human overpopulation.]\nUtnapishtim then said to Gilgamesh:\n\u201cI will reveal to you, O Gilgamesh, the mysterious story,\nAnd one of the mysteries of the gods I will tell you.\nThe city of Shurippak, a city which, as you know,\nIs situated on the bank of the river Euphrates. The gods within it 800\nDecided to bring about a flood, even the great gods,\nAs many as there were. But Ea, the lord of unfathomable wisdom, argued with them.\nAlthough he could not tell any human directly, he gave me a dream;\nIn the dream, he told their plan first to a reed-hut, saying:\n\u2018Reed-hut, reed-hut, clay-structure, clay-structure! 805\nReed-hut, hear; clay-structure, pay attention!\nMan of Shurippak, son of Ubara-Tutu,\nBuild a house, construct a ship;\nForsake your possessions, take heed!\nAbandon your goods, save your life, 810\nAnd bring the living seed of every kind of creature into the ship.\nAs for the ship, which you shall build,\nLet its proportions be well measured:\nIts breadth and its length shall bear proportion each to each,\nAnd into the sea then launch it.\u2019 815\nI took heed, and said to Ea, my lord:\n\u2018I will do, my lord, as you have commanded;\nI will observe and will fulfill the command.\nBut what shall I say when the city questions me, the people, and the elders?\u2019\nEa opened his mouth and spoke, 820\nAnd he said to me, his servant:\n\u2018Man, as an answer, say this to them:\n\u201cI know that Enlil hates me.\nNo longer can I live in your city;\nNor on Enlil\u2019s territory can I live securely any longer; 825\nI will go down to the sea, I will live with Ea, my lord.\nHe will pour down rich blessings.\nHe will grant fowls in plenty and fish in abundance,\nHerds of cattle and an abundant harvest.\u201d\u2019\nAs soon as early dawn appeared, 830\nI feared the brightness of the day;\nAll that was necessary I collected together.\nOn the fifth day I drew its design;\nIn its middle part its sides were ten gar high;\nTen gar also was the extent of its deck; 835\nI added a front-roof to it and closed it in.\nI built it in six stories,\nMaking seven floors in all;\nThe interior of each I divided again into nine partitions.\nBeaks for water within I cut out. 840\nI selected a pole and added all that was necessary.\nThree shar of pitch I smeared on its outside;\nThree shar of asphalt I used for the inside (to make it water-tight).\n95 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThree shar of oil the men carried, carrying it in vessels.\nOne shar of oil I kept out and used it for sacrifices, 845\nWhile the other two shar the boatman stowed away.\nFor the temple of the gods I slaughtered oxen;\nI killed lambs day by day.\nJugs of cider, of oil, and of sweet wine,\nLarge bowls, like river water flowing freely, I poured out as libations. 850\nI made a feast to the gods like that of the New-Year\u2019s Day.\nI added tackling above and below, and after all was finished,\nThe ship sank into water two thirds of its height.\nWith all that I possessed I filled it;\nWith all the silver I had I filled it; 855\nWith all the gold I had I filled it;\nWith living creatures of every kind I filled it.\nThen I embarked also all my family and my relatives,\nCattle of the field, beasts of the field, and the righteous people\u2014all of them I embarked.\nEa had appointed a time, namely: 860\n\u2018When the rulers of darkness send at eventide a destructive rain,\nThen enter into the ship and shut its door.\u2019\nThis very sign came to pass, and\nThe rulers of darkness sent a destructive rain at eventide.\nI saw the approach of the storm, 865\nAnd I was afraid to witness the storm;\nI entered the ship and shut the door.\nI entrusted the guidance of the ship to the boat-man,\nEntrusted the great house, and the contents therein.\nAs soon as early dawn appeared, 870\nThere rose up from the horizon a black cloud,\nWithin which the weather god thundered,\nAnd the king of the gods went before it.\nThe destroyers passed across mountain and dale.\nThey tore loose the restraints holding back the waters. 875\nThey caused the banks to overflow;\nThe Anunnaki lifted up their torches,\nAnd with their brightness they illuminated the universe.\nThe storm brought on by the gods swept even up to the heavens,\nAnd all light was turned into darkness. It flooded the land; it blew with violence; 880\nAnd in one day it rose above the mountains.\nLike an onslaught in battle it rushed in on the people.\nBrother could not save brother.\nThe gods even were afraid of the storm;\nThey retreated and took refuge in the heaven of Anu. 885\nThere the gods crouched down like dogs, in heaven they sat cowering.\nThen Ishtar cried out like a woman in travail,\nAnd the lady of the gods lamented with a loud voice, saying:\n\u2018The world of old has been turned back into clay,\nBecause I assented to this evil in the assembly of the gods. 890\nAlas, that I assented to this evil in the council of the gods,\nAlas, that I was for the destruction of my own people.\nWhere is all that I have created, where is it?\nLike the spawn of fish it fills the sea.\u2019\nThe gods wailed with her; 895\nThe gods were bowed down, and sat there weeping.\nTheir lips were pressed together in fear and in terror.\nSix days and nights the wind blew, and storm and tempest overwhelmed the country.\nWhen the seventh day arrived, the tempest, the storm, the battle\nWhich they had waged like a great host began to moderate. 900\n96 The Epic of Gilgamesh\nThe sea quieted down; hurricane and storm ceased.\nI looked out upon the sea and raised loud my voice,\nBut all mankind had turned back into clay.\nLike the surrounding field had become the bed of the rivers.\nI opened the air-hole and light fell upon my cheek. 905\nDumfounded I sank backward and sat weeping,\nWhile over my cheek flowed tears.\nI looked in every direction, and behold, all was sea.\nNow, after twelve days, there rose out of the water a strip of land.\nTo Mount Nisir the ship drifted. 910\nOn Mount Nisir the boat stuck fast and it did not slip away.\nThe first day, the second day, Mount Nisir held the ship fast, and did not let it slip away.\nThe third day, the fourth day, Mount Nisir held the ship fast, and did not let it slip away.\nThe fifth day, the sixth day, Mount Nisir held the ship fast, and did not let it slip away.\nWhen the seventh day arrived 915\nI sent out a dove, and let her go.\nThe dove flew hither and thither,\nBut as there was no resting-place for her, she returned.\nThen I sent out a swallow, and let her go.\nThe swallow flew hither and thither, 920\nBut as there was no resting-place for her she also returned.\nThen I sent out a raven, and let her go.\nThe raven flew away and saw that the waters were receding.\nShe settled down to feed, went away, and returned no more.\nThen I let everything go out of the boat, and I offered a sacrifice. 925\nI poured out a libation on the peak of the mountain.\nI placed the censers seven and seven,\nAnd poured into them calamus, cedar wood, and sweet incense.\nThe gods smelled the savor;\nThe gods gathered like flies around the sacrifice. 930\nBut when the lady of the gods, Ishtar, drew close,\nShe lifted up the precious necklace that Anu had made according to her wish and said:\n\u2018All you gods here! by my necklace, I will not forget.\nThese days will I remember, never will I forget them.\nLet the gods come to the offering; 935\nBut Enlil shall not come to the offering,\nSince rashly he caused the flood-storm,\nAnd handed over my people to destruction.\u2019\nNow, when Enlil drew close, and saw the ship, the god was angry,\nAnd anger against the gods filled his heart, and he said: 940\n\u2018Who then has escaped here with his life?\nNo man was to survive the universal destruction.\u2019\nThen Ninurta opened his mouth and spoke, saying to Enlil:\n\u2018Who but Ea could have planned this!\nFor does not Ea know all arts?\u2019 945\nThen Ea opened his mouth and spoke, saying to Enlil:\n\u2018O wise one among the gods, how rash of you to bring about a flood-storm!\nOn the sinner visit his sin, and on the wicked his wickedness;\nBut be merciful, forbear, let not all be destroyed! Be considerate!\nInstead of sending a flood-storm, 950\nLet lions come and diminish mankind;\nInstead of sending a flood-storm,\nLet tigers come and diminish mankind;\nInstead of sending a flood-storm,\nLet famine come and smite the land; 955\nInstead of sending a flood-storm,\nLet pestilence come and kill off the people.\n97 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nI did not reveal the mystery of the great gods.\nUtnapishtim saw this in a dream, and so he heard the mystery of the gods.\u2019\nEnlil then arrived at a decision. 960\nEnlil went up into the ship,\nTook me by the hand and led me out.\nHe led out also my wife and made her kneel beside me;\nHe turned us face to face, and standing between us, blessed us, saying:\n\u2018Before this Utnapishtim was only human; 965\nBut now Utnapishtim and his wife shall be lofty like the gods;\nLet Utnapishtim live far away from men.\u2019\nThen they took us and let us dwell far away.\u201d\nUtnapishtim said to Gilgamesh:\n\u201cNow as for you, which one of the gods shall give you the power, 970\nSo that you can obtain the life that you desire?\nNow sleep!\u201d And for six days and seven nights Gilgamesh slept.\nSleep came over him like a storm wind.\nThen Utnapishtim said to his wife:\n\u201cBehold, here is the hero whose desire is life everlasting! 975\nSleep came over him like a storm wind.\u201d\nAnd the wife replied to Utnapishtim, the far-away:\n\u201cRestore him in health, before he returns on the road on which he came.\nLet him pass out through the great door unto his own country.\u201d\nAnd Utnapishtim said to his wife: 980\n\u201cThe suffering of the man pains you.\nWell, then, cook the food for him and place it at his head.\u201d\nAnd while Gilgamesh slept on board the ship,\nShe cooked the food to place it at his head.\nAnd while he slept on board the ship, 985\nFirstly, his food was prepared;\nSecondly, it was peeled; thirdly, it was moistened;\nFourthly, his food was cleaned;\nFifthly, [seasoning] was added;\nSixthly, it was cooked; 990\nSeventhly, all of a sudden the man was restored, having eaten of the magic food.\nThen spoke Gilgamesh to Utnapishtim, the far-away:\n\u201cI had collapsed into sleep, and you have charmed me in some way.\u201d\nAnd Utnapishtim said to Gilgamesh:\n\u201cI restored you when you ate the magic food.\u201d 995\nAnd Gilgamesh said to Utnapishtim, the far-away:\n\u201cWhat shall I do, Utnapishtim? Where shall I go?\nThe Demon of the Dead has seized my friend.\nUpon my couch Death now sits.\u201d\nAnd Utnapishtim said to Urshanabi, the ferryman: 1000\n\u201cUrshanabi, you allowed a man to cross with you, you let the boat carry both of you;\nWhoever attempts to board the boat, you should have stopped him.\nThis man has his body covered with sores,\nAnd the eruption of his skin has altered the beauty of his body.\nTake him, Urshanabi, and bring him to the place of purification, 1005\nWhere he can wash his sores in water that they may become white as snow;\nLet him rub off his bad skin and the sea will carry it away;\nHis body shall then appear well and healthy;\nLet the turban also be replaced on his head, and the garment that covers his nakedness.\nUntil he returns to his city, until he arrives at his home, 1010\nThe garment shall not tear; it shall remain entirely new.\u201d\n98 The Epic of Gilgamesh\nAnd Urshanabi took him and brought him to the place of purification,\nWhere he washed his sores in water so that they became white as snow;\nHe rubbed off his bad skin and the sea carried it away;\nHis body appeared well and healthy again; 1015\nHe replaced also the turban on his head;\nAnd the garment that covered his nakedness;\nAnd until he returned to his city, until he arrived at his home,\nThe garment did not tear, it remained entirely new.\nAfter Gilgamesh and Urshanabi had returned from the place of purification, 1020\nThe wife of Utnapishtim spoke to her husband, saying:\n\u201cGilgamesh has labored long;\nWhat now will you give him before he returns to his country?\u201d\n.\nThen Utnapishtim spoke to Gilgamesh, saying:\n\u201cGilgamesh, you have labored long. 1025\nWhat now shall I give you before you return to your country?\nI will reveal to you, Gilgamesh, a mystery,\nAnd a secret of the gods I will tell you.\nThere is a plant resembling buckthorn,\nits thorn stings like that of a bramble. 1030\nIf you eat that plant, you will regain the vigor of your youth.\u201d\nWhen Gilgamesh had heard this, he bound heavy stones to his feet,\nWhich dragged him down to the sea and in this way he found the plant.\nThen he grasped the magic plant.\nHe removed the heavy stones from his feet and one dropped down into the sea, 1035\nAnd the second stone he threw down to the first.\nAnd Gilgamesh said to Urshanabi, the ferryman:\n\u201cUrshanabi, this plant is a plant of great power;\nI will take it to Uruk the strong-walled, I will cultivate the plant there and then harvest it.\nIts name will be \u2018Even an old man will be rejuvenated!\u2019 1040\nI will eat this plant and return again to the vigor of my youth.\u201d\n[They start out to return home to Uruk.]\nEvery forty leagues they then took a meal:\nAnd every sixty leagues they took a rest.\nAnd Gilgamesh saw a well that was filled with cool and refreshing water;\nHe stepped up to it and poured out some water. 1045\nA serpent darted out; the plant slipped from Gilgamesh\u2019s hands;\nThe serpent came out of the well, and took the plant away,\nAnd he uttered a curse.\nAnd after this Gilgamesh sat down and wept.\nTears flowed down his cheeks, 1050\nAnd he said to Urshanabi, the ferryman:\n\u201cWhy, Urshanabi, did my hands tremble?\nWhy did the blood of my heart stand still?\nNot on myself did I bestow any benefit.\nThe serpent now has all of the benefit of this plant. 1055\nAfter a journey of only forty leagues the plant has been snatched away,\nAs I opened the well and lowered the vessel.\nI see the sign; this is an omen to me. I am to return, leaving the ship on the shore.\u201d\nThen they continued to take a meal every forty leagues,\nAnd every sixty leagues they took a rest, 1060\nUntil they arrived at Uruk the strong-walled.\n99 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nGilgamesh then spoke to Urshanabi, the ferryman, saying:\n\u201cUrshanabi, ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk,\nInspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, made of burned brick,\nAnd its foundation strong. One shar is the size of the city, 1065\nAnd one shar is the size of the gardens,\nAnd one shar is the size of Eanna, temple of Anu and Ishtar;\nThree shar is the size of Uruk strong-walled.\u201d\n[Now that Gilgamesh knows that he cannot have eternal life, he focuses instead on learning about the afterlife. He tries\nto find a way to talk to Enkidu by bringing back his ghost to haunt him. Gilgamesh speaks to the Architect of the Tem-\nple, asking what he should do to avoid bringing back a ghost\u2014while planning to do the opposite.]\nThe Architect answered Gilgamesh, saying:\n\u201cGilgamesh, to avoid ghosts, if you go to the temple, do not wear clean garments; 1070\nWear a garment that is dirty, so you do not attract them.\nDo not anoint yourself with sweet oil, in case at its fragrance\nAround you they gather: nor may you set a bow on the ground, or around you\nMay circle those shot by the bow; nor may you carry a stick in your hand,\nOr ghosts who were beaten may gibber around you: nor may you put on a shoe, 1075\nWhich would make a loud echo on the ground: you may not kiss the wife whom you love;\nThe wife whom you hate\u2014you may not chastise her,\nYes, and you may not kiss the child whom you love,\nNor may you chastise the child whom you hate,\nFor you must mourn their [the ghosts\u2019] loss of the world.\u201d 1080\nSo Gilgamesh went to the temples,\nPut on clean garments, and with sweet oil anointed himself:\nThey gathered around the fragrance;\nAround him they gathered: he set the bow on the ground, and around him\nCircled the spirits\u2014those who were shot by a bow gibbered at him; 1085\nHe carried a stick in his hand, and the ghosts who had been beaten gibbered at him.\nHe put on a shoe and made a loud echo on the ground.\nHe kissed the wife whom he loved, chastised the wife whom he hated,\nHe kissed the child whom he loved, chastised the child whom he hated.\nThey mourned their loss of the world, but Enkidu was not there. 1090\nGilgamesh went all alone to the temple of Enlil:\n\u201cEnlil, my Father, the net of Death has stricken me also, holding me down to the earth.\nEnkidu\u2014whom I pray that you will raise from the earth\u2014was not seized by the Plague god,\nOr lost through a battle of mortals: it was only the earth which has seized him.\u201d\nBut Enlil, the Father, gave no answer. 1095\nTo the Moon god Gilgamesh went:\n\u201cMoon god, my Father, the net of Death has stricken me also, holding me down to the earth.\nEnkidu\u2014whom I pray that you will raise from the earth\u2014was not seized by the Plague god,\nOr lost through a battle of mortals: it was only the earth which has seized him.\u201d\nBut Sin, the Moon god, gave no answer. 1100\nThen to Ea Gilgamesh went:\n\u201cEa, my Father, the net of Death has stricken me also, holding me down to the earth.\nEnkidu\u2014whom I pray that you will raise from the earth\u2014was not seized by the Plague god,\nOr lost through a battle of mortals: it was only the earth which has seized him.\u201d\nEa, the Father, heard him, and to Nergal, the warrior-hero, 1105\nHe spoke: \u201cO Nergal, O warrior-hero, listen to me!\n100 The Epic of Gilgamesh\nOpen now a hole in the earth, so that the spirit of Enkidu, rising,\nMay come forth from the earth, and so speak with his brother.\u201d\nNergal, the warrior-hero, listened to Ea\u2019s words,\nOpened, then, a hole in the earth, and the spirit of Enkidu issued 1110\nForth from the earth like a wind. They embraced and grieved together. Gilgamesh said:\n\u201cTell, O my friend, O tell me, I pray you,\nWhat have you seen of the laws of the Underworld?\u201d\nEnkidu said: \u201cDo not ask; I will not tell you\u2014for, were I to tell you\nOf what I have seen of the laws of the Underworld, you would sit down weeping!\u201d 1115\nGilgamesh said: \u201cThen let me sit down weeping.\u201d\nEnkidu said: \u201cSo be it: the friend you cared for now has worms in his body;\nThe bride you loved is now filled with dust.\nBitter and sad is all that formerly gladdened your heart.\u201d\nGilgamesh said: \u201cDid you see a hero, slain in battle?\u201d 1120\n\u201cYes\u2014[when he died] his father and mother supported his head,\nAnd his wife knelt weeping at his side.\nThe spirit of such a man is at rest. He lies on a couch and drinks pure water.\nBut the man whose corpse remains unburied on the field\u2014\nYou and I have often seen such a man\u2014 1125\nHis spirit does not find rest in the Underworld.\nThe man whose spirit has no one who cares for it\u2014\nYou and I have often seen such man\u2014\nConsumes the dregs of the bowl, the broken remnants of food\nThat are cast into the street.\u201d 1130\n[One important lesson for all readers of the poem is, therefore, \u201cTake good care of your dead.\u201d The rest of the\ntablet is damaged, although one alternate version of the story ends with the funeral of Gilgamesh many years\nlater. Interestingly, once he settles down to become a good ruler, there is nothing more to say.]\nTHE ILIAD AnD THE oDySSEy\nHomer\nComposed orally ca. 800 B.C.E.; written down ca. 700 B.C.E.\nGreece\nWe know almost nothing about Homer; scholars debate whether one or more authors composed the epic po-\nems attributed to him. It is possible that he was a Greek who lived on the coast of what is now Turkey, not far from\nthe location of Troy. If so, his balanced depiction of the Greeks and the Trojans in the Iliad is noteworthy, since he\nwould be a descendant of those Greeks who invaded the area approximately 400 years earlier, when the historical\nTroy was attacked and burned in around 1200 B.C.E. The Iliad encompasses a few weeks in the tenth year of the\nTrojan War, focusing on one episode in the life of the Greek warrior Achilles, while the Odyssey explains why Odys-\nseus spends twelve long years trying to go home. Homer\u2019s grasp of Mediterranean geography is strong, as is evident\nwhen he traces the wandering route that Odysseus takes to return home to Ithaca after the war. Homer was not the\nfirst or the last to write about the Trojan War and its aftermath, but his version was the most famous, in part for his\nvivid descriptions (which would be imitated by other authors, including Virgil in his Aeneid, for centuries to come)\nFor an audience that might not have witnessed a battle, Homer appeals to their senses through familiar sights and\nsounds; men hacking at each other with bronze weapons sound like a forest full of woodcutters hacking at trees.\nWhen Dante tries to describe the interior of Hell, he is imitating Virgil imitating Homer: familiar ways of seeing\n101 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nunfamiliar things. Homer\u2019s version was also controversial; Greek writers such as Xenophanes criticized Homer for\nhis impious depiction of the gods, who appear at times brutal, at times humorous. That criticism should remind us\nthat Homer composed a literary version of events, rather than a strictly accurate view of his culture. What has never\nbeen controversial is Homer\u2019s popularity, from his own time to the present day.\nWritten by Laura J. Getty\nThe Iliad\nLicense: Public Domain\nHomer, translated by Samuel Butler\nBook I\nSing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus,that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a\nbrave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were\nthe counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out\nwith one another.\nAnd which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry\nwith the king and sent a pestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had dishonoured\nChryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with\nhim a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant\u2019s wreath and he\nbesought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.\n\u201cSons of Atreus,\u201d he cried, \u201cand all other Achaeans, may the gods who dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the\ncity of Priam, and to reach your homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her, in reverence to\nApollo, son of Jove.\u201d\nOn this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he\noffered; but not so Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. \u201cOld man,\u201d said he, \u201clet me\nnot find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming hereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit\nyou nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos far from her own home, busying herself\nwith her loom and visiting my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.\u201d\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by the shore of the sounding sea and\nprayed apart to King Apollo whom lovely Leto had borne. \u201cHear me,\u201d he cried, \u201cO god of the silver bow, that pro-\ntectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked\nyour temple with garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows\navenge these my tears upon the Danaans.\u201d\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious from the summits of Olympus, with his\nbow and his quiver upon his shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled within him.\nHe sat himself down away from the ships with a face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his\narrow in the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the\npeople themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were burning.\nFor nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon the tenth day Achilles called them in as-\nsembly\u2014oved thereto by Juno, who saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon them. Then,\nwhen they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.\n\u201cSon of Atreus,\u201d said he, \u201cI deem that we should now turn roving home if we would escape destruction, for we\nare being cut down by war and pestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some reader of dreams (for\ndreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why Phoebus Apollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that\nwe have broken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will accept the savour of lambs and goats\nwithout blemish, so as to take away the plague from us.\u201d\nWith these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest of augurs, who knew things past present and\nto come, rose to speak. He it was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius, through the prophesyings\nwith which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him. With all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus:\u2014\n\u201cAchilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger of King Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consid-\ner first and swear that you will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that I shall offend one who rules\nthe Argives with might, to whom all the Achaeans are in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the anger\nof a king, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge till he has wreaked it. Consider, therefore,\nwhether or no you will protect me.\u201d\nAnd Achilles answered, \u201cFear not, but speak as it is borne in upon you from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to\nwhom you pray, and whose oracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand upon you, while I\n102 The Iliad\nyet live to look upon the face of the earth\u2014no, not though you name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the fore-\nmost of the Achaeans.\u201d\nThereon the seer spoke boldly. \u201cThe god,\u201d he said, \u201cis angry neither about vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest\u2019s\nsake, whom Agamemnon has dishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter nor take a ransom for her; there-\nfore has he sent these evils upon us, and will yet send others. He will not deliver the Danaans from this pestilence\ntill Agamemnon has restored the girl without fee or ransom to her father, and has sent a holy hecatomb to Chryse.\nThus we may perhaps appease him.\u201d\nWith these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His heart was black with rage, and his eyes\nflashed fire as he scowled on Calchas and said, \u201cSeer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth things concerning\nme, but have ever loved to foretell that which was evil. You have brought me neither comfort nor performance; and\nnow you come seeing among Danaans, and saying that Apollo has plagued us because I would not take a ransom\nfor this girl, the daughter of Chryses. I have set my heart on keeping her in my own house, for I love her better\neven than my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer she is alike in form and feature, in understanding and accom-\nplishments. Still I will give her up if I must, for I would have the people live, not die; but you must find me a prize\ninstead, or I alone among the Argives shall be without one. This is not well; for you behold, all of you, that my prize\nis to go elsewhither.\u201d\nAnd Achilles answered, \u201cMost noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond all mankind, how shall the Achaeans find\nyou another prize? We have no common store from which to take one. Those we took from the cities have been\nawarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made already. Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if\never Jove grants us to sack the city of Troy we will requite you three and fourfold.\u201d\nThen Agamemnon said, \u201cAchilles, valiant though you be, you shall not thus outwit me. You shall not overreach\nand you shall not persuade me. Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss and give up the\ngirl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prize in fair exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your\nown, or that of Ajax or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shall rue my coming. But of this we will take\nthought hereafter; for the present, let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for her expressly; let us put a heca-\ntomb on board, and let us send Chryseis also; further, let some chief man among us be in command, either Ajax, or\nIdomeneus, or yourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you are, that we may offer sacrifice and appease the the\nanger of the god.\u201d\nAchilles scowled at him and answered, \u201cYou are steeped in insolence and lust of gain. With what heart can any\nof the Achaeans do your bidding, either on foray or in open fighting? I came not warring here for any ill the Tro-\njans had done me. I have no quarrel with them. They have not raided my cattle nor my horses, nor cut down my\nharvests on the rich plains of Phthia; for between me and them there is a great space, both mountain and sounding\nsea. We have followed you, Sir Insolence! for your pleasure, not ours \u2014 to gain satisfaction from the Trojans for\nyour shameless self and for Menelaus. You forget this, and threaten to rob me of the prize for which I have toiled,\nand which the sons of the Achaeans have given me. Never when the Achaeans sack any rich city of the Trojans do\nI receive so good a prize as you do, though it is my hands that do the better part of the fighting. When the sharing\ncomes, your share is far the largest, and I, forsooth, must go back to my ships, take what I can get and be thankful,\nwhen my labour of fighting is done. Now, therefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will be much better for me to return\nhome with my ships, for I will not stay here dishonoured to gather gold and substance for you.\u201d\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \u201cFly if you will, I shall make you no prayers to stay you. I have others here who\nwill do me honour, and above all Jove, the lord of counsel. There is no king here so hateful to me as you are, for you\nare ever quarrelsome and ill affected. What though you be brave? Was it not heaven that made you so? Go home,\nthen, with your ships and comrades to lord it over the Myrmidons. I care neither for you nor for your anger; and\nthus will I do: since Phoebus Apollo is taking Chryseis from me, I shall send her with my ship and my followers, but\nI shall come to your tent and take your own prize Briseis, that you may learn how much stronger I am than you are,\nand that another may fear to set himself up as equal or comparable with me.\u201d\nThe son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy breast was divided whether to draw his sword,\npush the others aside, and kill the son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check his anger. While he was thus in\ntwo minds, and was drawing his mighty sword from its scabbard, Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno had\nsent her in the love she bore to them both), and seized the son of Peleus by his yellow hair, visible to him alone,\nfor of the others no man could see her. Achilles turned in amaze, and by the fire that flashed from her eyes at once\nknew that she was Minerva. \u201cWhy are you here,\u201d said he, \u201cdaughter of aegis-bearing Jove? To see the pride of Agam-\nemnon, son of Atreus? Let me tell you\u2014and it shall surely be\u2014he shall pay for this insolence with his life.\u201d\nAnd Minerva said, \u201cI come from heaven, if you will hear me, to bid you stay your anger. Juno has sent me, who\ncares for both of you alike. Cease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail at him if you will, and your\nrailing will not be vain, for I tell you\u2014and it shall surely be\u2014that you shall hereafter receive gifts three times as\nsplendid by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore, and obey.\u201d\n103 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u201cGoddess,\u201d answered Achilles, \u201chowever angry a man may be, he must do as you two command him. This will\nbe best, for the gods ever hear the prayers of him who has obeyed them.\u201d\nHe stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust it back into the scabbard as Minerva bade him.\nThen she went back to Olympus among the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing Jove.\nBut the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus, for he was still in a rage. \u201cWine-bibber,\u201d he cried,\n\u201cwith the face of a dog and the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with the host in fight, nor yet with our\nchosen men in ambuscade. You shun this as you do death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizes from\nany man who contradicts you. You devour your people, for you are king over a feeble folk; otherwise, son of Atreus,\nhenceforward you would insult no man. Therefore I say, and swear it with a great oath\u2014nay, by this my sceptre\nwhich shalt sprout neither leaf nor shoot, nor bud anew from the day on which it left its parent stem upon the\nmountains\u2014for the axe stripped it of leaf and bark, and now the sons of the Achaeans bear it as judges and guard-\nians of the decrees of heaven\u2014so surely and solemnly do I swear that hereafter they shall look fondly for Achilles\nand shall not find him. In the day of your distress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand of Hector, you\nshall not know how to help them, and shall rend your heart with rage for the hour when you offered insult to the\nbravest of the Achaeans.\u201d\nWith this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on the ground and took his seat, while the son\nof Atreus was beginning fiercely from his place upon the other side. Then uprose smooth-tongued Nestor, the facile\nspeaker of the Pylians, and the words fell from his lips sweeter than honey. Two generations of men born and bred\nin Pylos had passed away under his rule, and he was now reigning over the third. With all sincerity and goodwill,\ntherefore, he addressed them thus:\u2014\n\u201cOf a truth,\u201d he said, \u201ca great sorrow has befallen the Achaean land. Surely Priam with his sons would rejoice,\nand the Trojans be glad at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are so excellent in fight and\ncounsel. I am older than either of you; therefore be guided by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend of men\neven greater than you are, and they did not disregard my counsels. Never again can I behold such men as Pirithous\nand Dryas shepherd of his people, or as Caeneus, Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus son of Aegeus, peer\nof the immortals. These were the mightiest men ever born upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they\nfought the fiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them. I came from distant Pylos, and went\nabout among them, for they would have me come, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a man now living could\nwithstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded by them. So be it also with yourselves, for this is\nthe more excellent way. Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girl away, for the sons of the\nAchaeans have already given her to Achilles; and you, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man who by\nthe grace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon. You are strong, and have a goddess for your\nmother; but Agamemnon is stronger than you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus, check your anger,\nI implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who in the day of battle is a tower of strength to the Achaeans.\u201d\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \u201cSir, all that you have said is true, but this fellow must needs become our lord and\nmaster: he must be lord of all, king of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be. Granted that the gods have\nmade him a great warrior, have they also given him the right to speak with railing?\u201d\nAchilles interrupted him. \u201cI should be a mean coward,\u201d he cried, \u201cwere I to give in to you in all things. Order\nother people about, not me, for I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say\u2014and lay my saying to your heart\u2014I shall\nfight neither you nor any man about this girl, for those that take were those also that gave. But of all else that is at\nmy ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, that others may see; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with\nyour blood.\u201d\nWhen they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up the assembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The\nson of Peleus went back to his tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company, while Agamemnon drew\na vessel into the water and chose a crew of twenty oarsmen. He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover a\nhecatomb for the god. And Ulysses went as captain.\nThese, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea. But the son of Atreus bade the people purify\nthemselves; so they purified themselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then they offered hecatombs of bulls and\ngoats without blemish on the sea-shore, and the smoke with the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up towards\nheaven.\nThus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon did not forget the threat that he had\nmade Achilles, and called his trusty messengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. \u201cGo,\u201d said he, \u201cto the tent of\nAchilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand and bring her hither; if he will not give her I shall come with others\nand take her\u2014which will press him harder.\u201d\nHe charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon they went their way sorrowfully by the sea-\nside, till they came to the tents and ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by his tent and his ships,\nand ill-pleased he was when he beheld them. They stood fearfully and reverently before him, and never a word did\n104 The Iliad\nthey speak, but he knew them and said, \u201cWelcome, heralds, messengers of gods and men; draw near; my quarrel is\nnot with you but with Agamemnon who has sent you for the girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus, bring her and give\nher to them, but let them be witnesses by the blessed gods, by mortal men, and by the fierceness of Agamemnon\u2019s\nanger, that if ever again there be need of me to save the people from ruin, they shall seek and they shall not find.\nAgamemnon is mad with rage and knows not how to look before and after that the Achaeans may fight by their\nships in safety.\u201d\nPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseis from the tent and gave her over to the\nheralds, who took her with them to the ships of the Achaeans\u2014 and the woman was loth to go. Then Achilles went\nall alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping and looking out upon the boundless waste of waters. He raised his\nhands in prayer to his immortal mother, \u201cMother,\u201d he cried, \u201cyou bore me doomed to live but for a little season;\nsurely Jove, who thunders from Olympus, might have made that little glorious. It is not so. Agamemnon, son of\nAtreus, has done me dishonour, and has robbed me of my prize by force.\u201d\nAs he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was sitting in the depths of the sea hard by\nthe old man her father. Forthwith she rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat down before him as he stood\nweeping, caressed him with her hand, and said, \u201cMy son, why are you weeping? What is it that grieves you? Keep it\nnot from me, but tell me, that we may know it together.\u201d\nAchilles drew a deep sigh and said, \u201cYou know it; why tell you what you know well already? We went to Thebe\nthe strong city of Eetion, sacked it, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of the Achaeans shared it duly among\nthemselves, and chose lovely Chryseis as the meed of Agamemnon; but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to the\nships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the\nsceptre of Apollo, wreathed with a suppliant\u2019s wreath, and he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of\nAtreus who were their chiefs.\n\u201cOn this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he\noffered; but not so Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. So he went back in anger,\nand Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer. Then the god sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the\npeople died thick on one another, for the arrows went everywhither among the wide host of the Achaeans. At last a\nseer in the fulness of his knowledge declared to us the oracles of Apollo, and I was myself first to say that we should\nappease him. Whereon the son of Atreus rose in anger, and threatened that which he has since done. The Achaeans\nare now taking the girl in a ship to Chryse, and sending gifts of sacrifice to the god; but the heralds have just taken\nfrom my tent the daughter of Briseus, whom the Achaeans had awarded to myself.\n\u201cHelp your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, and if you have ever done him service in\nword or deed, implore the aid of Jove. Ofttimes in my father\u2019s house have I heard you glory in that you alone of\nthe immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin, when the others, with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would\nhave put him in bonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to Olympus the hundred-handed mon-\nster whom gods call Briareus, but men Aegaeon, for he is stronger even than his father; when therefore he took\nhis seat all-glorious beside the son of Saturn, the other gods were afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then, to him,\nremind him of all this, clasp his knees, and bid him give succour to the Trojans. Let the Achaeans be hemmed in at\nthe sterns of their ships, and perish on the sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of their king, and that\nAgamemnon may rue his blindness in offering insult to the foremost of the Achaeans.\u201d\nThetis wept and answered, \u201cMy son, woe is me that I should have borne or suckled you. Would indeed that you\nhad lived your span free from all sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you should be at once short\nof life and long of sorrow above your peers: woe, therefore, was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless I will\ngo to the snowy heights of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove, if he will hear our prayer: meanwhile stay where you\nare with your ships, nurse your anger against the Achaeans, and hold aloof from fight. For Jove went yesterday to\nOceanus, to a feast among the Ethiopians, and the other gods went with him. He will return to Olympus twelve days\nhence; I will then go to his mansion paved with bronze and will beseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able to\npersuade him.\u201d\nOn this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had been taken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached\nChryse with the hecatomb. When they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laid them in the ship\u2019s\nhold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the mast into its place, and rowed the ship to the place where they would\nhave her lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones and made fast the hawsers. They then got out upon the sea-\nshore and landed the hecatomb for Apollo; Chryseis also left the ship, and Ulysses led her to the altar to deliver her\ninto the hands of her father. \u201cChryses,\u201d said he, \u201cKing Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back your child, and\nto offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that we may propitiate the god, who has now brought sorrow\nupon the Argives.\u201d\nSo saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her gladly, and they ranged the holy hecatomb all\norderly round the altar of the god. They washed their hands and took up the barley-meal to sprinkle over the vic-\n105 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ntims, while Chryses lifted up his hands and prayed aloud on their behalf. \u201cHear me,\u201d he cried, \u201cO god of the silver\nbow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla, and rulest Tenedos with thy might. Even as thou didst hear me aforetime\nwhen I prayed, and didst press hardly upon the Achaeans, so hear me yet again, and stay this fearful pestilence from\nthe Danaans.\u201d\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal,\nthey drew back the heads of the victims and killed and flayed them. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them\nround in two layers of fat, set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them, and then Chryses laid them on the wood\nfire and poured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When\nthe thigh-bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon\nthe spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off: then, when they had finished their work and the feast\nwas ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough\nto eat and drink, pages filled the mixing-bowl with wine and water and handed it round, after giving every man his\ndrink-offering.\nThus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymning him and chaunting the joyous paean,\nand the god took pleasure in their voices; but when the sun went down, and it came on dark, they laid themselves\ndown to sleep by the stern cables of the ship, and when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they\nagain set sail for the host of the Achaeans. Apollo sent them a fair wind, so they raised their mast and hoisted their\nwhite sails aloft. As the sail bellied with the wind the ship flew through the deep blue water, and the foam hissed\nagainst her bows as she sped onward. When they reached the wide-stretching host of the Achaeans, they drew the\nvessel ashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath her, and went their ways to their own tents\nand ships.\nBut Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not to the honourable assembly, and sallied not\nforth to fight, but gnawed at his own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry.\nNow after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to Olympus, and Jove led the way. Thetis was not\nunmindful of the charge her son had laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and went through great heaven\nwith early morning to Olympus, where she found the mighty son of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmost ridges.\nShe sat herself down before him, and with her left hand seized his knees, while with her right she caught him under\nthe chin, and besought him, saying\u2014\n\u201cFather Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the immortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to\nmy son, whose life is to be cut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by taking his prize and keep-\ning her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lord of counsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans\ngive my son his due and load him with riches in requital.\u201d\nJove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still kept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a\nsecond time. \u201cIncline your head,\u201d said she, \u201cand promise me surely, or else deny me\u2014for you have nothing to fear\u2014\nthat I may learn how greatly you disdain me.\u201d\nAt this Jove was much troubled and answered, \u201cI shall have trouble if you set me quarrelling with Juno, for she\nwill provoke me with her taunting speeches; even now she is always railing at me before the other gods and accus-\ning me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go back now, lest she should find out. I will consider the matter, and will bring\nit about as wish. See, I incline my head that you believe me. This is the most solemn that I can give to any god. I\nnever recall my word, or deceive, or fail to do what I say, when I have nodded my head.\u201d\nAs he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and the ambrosial locks swayed on his immortal head, till\nvast Olympus reeled.\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted\u2014Jove to his house, while the goddess quitted the splen-\ndour of Olympus, and plunged into the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before the coming of their\nsire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting, but all stood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat.\nBut Juno, when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman\u2019s daughter, silver-footed Thetis, had been hatching\nmischief, so she at once began to upbraid him. \u201cTrickster,\u201d she cried, \u201cwhich of the gods have you been taking into\nyour counsels now? You are always settling matters in secret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you\ncould help it, one word of your intentions.\u201d\n\u201cJuno,\u201d replied the sire of gods and men, \u201cyou must not expect to be informed of all my counsels. You are my\nwife, but you would find it hard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there is no one, god or man,\nwho will be told sooner, but when I mean to keep a matter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions.\u201d\n\u201cDread son of Saturn,\u201d answered Juno, \u201cwhat are you talking about? I? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you\nhave your own way in everything. Still, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman\u2019s daughter Thetis has been\ntalking you over, for she was with you and had hold of your knees this self-same morning. I believe, therefore, that\nyou have been promising her to give glory to Achilles, and to kill much people at the ships of the Achaeans.\u201d\n\u201cWife,\u201d said Jove, \u201cI can do nothing but you suspect me and find it out. You will take nothing by it, for I shall\n106 The Iliad\nonly dislike you the more, and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you say; I mean to have it so; sit down\nand hold your tongue as I bid you for if I once begin to lay my hands about you, though all heaven were on your\nside it would profit you nothing.\u201d\nOn this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and sat down in silence. But the heavenly beings\nwere disquieted throughout the house of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try and pacify his mother\nJuno. \u201cIt will be intolerable,\u201d said he, \u201cif you two fall to wrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack of\nmortals. If such ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no pleasure at our banquet. Let me then advise my moth-\ner\u2014and she must herself know that it will be better\u2014to make friends with my dear father Jove, lest he again scold\nher and disturb our feast. If the Olympian Thunderer wants to hurl us all from our seats, he can do so, for he is far\nthe strongest, so give him fair words, and he will then soon be in a good humour with us.\u201d\nAs he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in his mother\u2019s hand. \u201cCheer up, my dear mother,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cand make the best of it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you get a thrashing; however\ngrieved I might be, I could not help for there is no standing against Jove. Once before when I was trying to help you,\nhe caught me by the foot and flung me from the heavenly threshold. All day long from morn till eve, was I falling,\ntill at sunset I came to ground in the island of Lemnos, and there I lay, with very little life left in me, till the Sintians\ncame and tended me.\u201d\nJuno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her son\u2019s hands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar\nfrom the mixing-bowl, and served it round among the gods, going from left to right; and the blessed gods laughed\nout a loud applause as they saw him ing bustling about the heavenly mansion.\nThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and every one had his full share, so that\nall were satisfied. Apollo struck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices, calling and answering one anoth-\ner. But when the sun\u2019s glorious light had faded, they went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lame Vulcan\nwith his consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove, the Olympian Lord of Thunder, hied him to the bed in\nwhich he always slept; and when he had got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the golden throne by his side.\nBook II\nNow the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept soundly, but Jove was wakeful, for he was think-\ning how to do honour to Achilles, and destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans. In the end he deemed it\nwould be best to send a lying dream to King Agamemnon; so he called one to him and said to it, \u201cLying Dream, go\nto the ships of the Achaeans, into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to him word to word as I now bid you. Tell him\nto get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for he shall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the\ngods; Juno has brought them to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans.\u201d\nThe dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached the ships of the Achaeans. It sought Agam-\nemnon son of Atreus and found him in his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his head in the\nlikeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honoured above all his councillors, and said:\u2014\n\u201cYou are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his host and so much other care upon his shoulders\nshould dock his sleep. Hear me at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who, though he be not near, yet takes\nthought for you and pities you. He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There\nare no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the\nTrojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this, and when you wake see that it does not escape you.\u201d\nThe dream then left him, and he thought of things that were, surely not to be accomplished. He thought that\non that same day he was to take the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mind of Jove, who had many\nanother hard-fought fight in store alike for Danaans and Trojans. Then presently he woke, with the divine message\nstill ringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and put on his soft shirt so fair and new, and over this his heavy cloak. He\nbound his sandals on to his comely feet, and slung his silver-studded sword about his shoulders; then he took the\nimperishable staff of his father, and sallied forth to the ships of the Achaeans.\nThe goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she might herald day to Jove and to the other\nimmortals, and Agamemnon sent the criers round to call the people in assembly; so they called them and the peo-\nple gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting of the elders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when\nthey were assembled he laid a cunning counsel before them.\n\u201cMy friends,\u201d said he, \u201cI have had a dream from heaven in the dead of night, and its face and figure resembled\nnone but Nestor\u2019s. It hovered over my head and said, \u2018You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his\nhost and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messenger from\nJove, who, though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get the Achaeans instantly\nunder arms, for you shall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them\nover to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this.\u2019 The dream then vanished\n107 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nand I awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm the sons of the Achaeans. But it will be well that I should first sound them,\nand to this end I will tell them to fly with their ships; but do you others go about among the host and prevent their\ndoing so.\u201d\nHe then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: \u201cMy\nfriends,\u201d said he, \u201cprinces and councillors of the Argives, if any other man of the Achaeans had told us of this dream\nwe should have declared it false, and would have had nothing to do with it. But he who has seen it is the foremost\nman among us; we must therefore set about getting the people under arms.\u201d\nWith this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptred kings rose with him in obedience to the\nword of Agamemnon; but the people pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally from some hollow\ncave and flit in countless throng among the spring flowers, bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mighty\nmultitude pour from ships and tents to the assembly, and range themselves upon the wide-watered shore, while\namong them ran Wildfire Rumour, messenger of Jove, urging them ever to the fore. Thus they gathered in a pell-\nmell of mad confusion, and the earth groaned under the tramp of men as the people sought their places. Nine\nheralds went crying about among them to stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till at last they were got\ninto their several places and ceased their clamour. Then King Agamemnon rose, holding his sceptre. This was the\nwork of Vulcan, who gave it to Jove the son of Saturn. Jove gave it to Mercury, slayer of Argus, guide and guardian.\nKing Mercury gave it to Pelops, the mighty charioteer, and Pelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people. Atreus, when\nhe died, left it to Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to be borne by Agamemnon, that he might\nbe lord of all Argos and of the isles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed the Argives.\n\u201cMy friends,\u201d he said, \u201cheroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove\ngave me his solemn promise that I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he has played me false, and\nis now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has\nlaid many a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter\nthat an Achaean host, at once so great and valiant, battled in vain against men fewer in number than themselves;\nbut as yet the end is not in sight. Think that the Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and that\nthey have each been numbered\u2014the Trojans by the roll of their householders, and we by companies of ten; think\nfurther that each of our companies desired to have a Trojan householder to pour out their wine; we are so greatly\nmore in number that full many a company would have to go without its cup-bearer. But they have in the town allies\nfrom other places, and it is these that hinder me from being able to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine of Jove years are\ngone; the timbers of our ships have rotted; their tackling is sound no longer. Our wives and little ones at home look\nanxiously for our coming, but the work that we came hither to do has not been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as\nI say: let us sail back to our own land, for we shall not take Troy.\u201d\nWith these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of them as knew not the cunning counsel of\nAgamemnon. They surged to and fro like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and south winds break from\nheaven\u2019s clouds to lash them; or as when the west wind sweeps over a field of corn and the ears bow beneath the\nblast, even so were they swayed as they flew with loud cries towards the ships, and the dust from under their feet\nrose heavenward. They cheered each other on to draw the ships into the sea; they cleared the channels in front of\nthem; they began taking away the stays from underneath them, and the welkin rang with their glad cries, so eager\nwere they to return.\nThen surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that was not fated. But Juno said to Minerva, \u201cAlas,\ndaughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to their own land over the broad sea, and\nleave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at\nTroy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man, that they draw\nnot their ships into the sea.\u201d\nMinerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus, and in a\nmoment she was at the ships of the Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, standing alone. He\nhad not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he was grieved and sorry; so she went close up to him and said, \u201cUlyss-\nes, noble son of Laertes, are you going to fling yourselves into your ships and be off home to your own land in this\nway? Will you leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans\nhave died at Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man,\nthat they draw not their ships into the sea.\u201d\nUlysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak from him and set off to run. His servant Eury-\nbates, a man of Ithaca, who waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon Ulysses went straight up to Agamemnon\nand received from him his ancestral, imperishable staff. With this he went about among the ships of the Achaeans.\nWhenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke him fairly. \u201cSir,\u201d said he, \u201cthis flight is coward-\nly and unworthy. Stand to your post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do not yet know the full mind\nof Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and ere long will visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not all of\n108 The Iliad\nus at the council to hear what he then said; see to it lest he be angry and do us a mischief; for the pride of kings is\ngreat, and the hand of Jove is with them.\u201d\nBut when he came across any common man who was making a noise, he struck him with his staff and rebuked\nhim, saying, \u201cSirrah, hold your peace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a coward and no soldier; you\nare nobody either in fight or council; we cannot all be kings; it is not well that there should be many masters; one\nman must be supreme\u2014one king to whom the son of scheming Saturn has given the sceptre of sovereignty over\nyou all.\u201d\nThus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people hurried back to the council from their tents\nand ships with a sound as the thunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, and all the sea is in an\nuproar.\nThe rest now took their seats and kept to their own several places, but Thersites still went on wagging his un-\nbridled tongue\u2014a man of many words, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, a railer against all who were in\nauthority, who cared not what he said, so that he might set the Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliest man of all\nthose that came before Troy\u2014bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two shoulders rounded and hunched over\nhis chest. His head ran up to a point, but there was little hair on the top of it. Achilles and Ulysses hated him worst\nof all, for it was with them that he was most wont to wrangle; now, however, with a shrill squeaky voice he began\nheaping his abuse on Agamemnon. The Achaeans were angry and disgusted, yet none the less he kept on brawling\nand bawling at the son of Atreus.\n\u201cAgamemnon,\u201d he cried, \u201cwhat ails you now, and what more do you want? Your tents are filled with bronze\nand with fair women, for whenever we take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you have yet more gold,\nwhich some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for his son, when I or another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or\nis it some young girl to hide and lie with? It is not well that you, the ruler of the Achaeans, should bring them into\nsuch misery. Weakling cowards, women rather than men, let us sail home, and leave this fellow here at Troy to stew\nin his own meeds of honour, and discover whether we were of any service to him or no. Achilles is a much better\nman than he is, and see how he has treated him\u2014robbing him of his prize and keeping it himself. Achilles takes it\nmeekly and shows no fight; if he did, son of Atreus, you would never again insult him.\u201d\nThus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him and rebuked him sternly. \u201cCheck your glib tongue,\nThersites,\u201d said be, \u201cand babble not a word further. Chide not with princes when you have none to back you. There\nis no viler creature come before Troy with the sons of Atreus. Drop this chatter about kings, and neither revile them\nnor keep harping about going home. We do not yet know how things are going to be, nor whether the Achaeans are\nto return with good success or evil. How dare you gibe at Agamemnon because the Danaans have awarded him so\nmany prizes? I tell you, therefore\u2014and it shall surely be\u2014that if I again catch you talking such nonsense, I will ei-\nther forfeit my own head and be no more called father of Telemachus, or I will take you, strip you stark naked, and\nwhip you out of the assembly till you go blubbering back to the ships.\u201d\nOn this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders till he dropped and fell a-weeping. The golden\nsceptre raised a bloody weal on his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish as he wiped the\ntears from his eyes. The people were sorry for him, yet they laughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour\nsaying, \u201cUlysses has done many a good thing ere now in fight and council, but he never did the Argives a better\nturn than when he stopped this fellow\u2019s mouth from prating further. He will give the kings no more of his inso-\nlence.\u201d\nThus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and Minerva in the likeness of a herald bade the peo-\nple be still, that those who were far off might hear him and consider his council. He therefore with all sincerity and\ngoodwill addressed them thus:\u2014\n\u201cKing Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among all mankind. They forget the prom-\nise they made you when they set out from Argos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town of Troy,\nand, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would set off homeward. True it is that they have had toil\nenough to be disheartened. A man chafes at having to stay away from his wife even for a single month, when he\nis on shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but it is now nine long years that we have been kept here; I cannot,\ntherefore, blame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed if we go home empty after so long a\nstay\u2014therefore, my friends, be patient yet a little longer that we may learn whether the prophesyings of Calchas\nwere false or true.\n\u201cAll who have not since perished must remember as though it were yesterday or the day before, how the ships\nof the Achaeans were detained in Aulis when we were on our way hither to make war on Priam and the Trojans.\nWe were ranged round about a fountain offering hecatombs to the gods upon their holy altars, and there was a fine\nplane-tree from beneath which there welled a stream of pure water. Then we saw a prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful\nserpent out of the ground, with blood-red stains upon its back, and it darted from under the altar on to the plane-\ntree. Now there was a brood of young sparrows, quite small, upon the topmost bough, peeping out from under the\n109 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nleaves, eight in all, and their mother that hatched them made nine. The serpent ate the poor cheeping things, while\nthe old bird flew about lamenting her little ones; but the serpent threw his coils about her and caught her by the\nwing as she was screaming. Then, when he had eaten both the sparrow and her young, the god who had sent him\nmade him become a sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turned him into stone, and we stood there wondering at\nthat which had come to pass. Seeing, then, that such a fearful portent had broken in upon our hecatombs, Calchas\nforthwith declared to us the oracles of heaven. \u2018Why, Achaeans,\u2019 said he, \u2018are you thus speechless? Jove has sent us\nthis sign, long in coming, and long ere it be fulfilled, though its fame shall last for ever. As the serpent ate the eight\nfledglings and the sparrow that hatched them, which makes nine, so shall we fight nine years at Troy, but in the\ntenth shall take the town.\u2019 This was what he said, and now it is all coming true. Stay here, therefore, all of you, till we\ntake the city of Priam.\u201d\nOn this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with the uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then ad-\ndressed them. \u201cShame on you,\u201d he cried, \u201cto stay talking here like children, when you should fight like men. Where\nare our covenants now, and where the oaths that we have taken? Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with our\ndrink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we have put our trust? We waste our time in words, and\nfor all our talking here shall be no further forward. Stand, therefore, son of Atreus, by your own steadfast purpose;\nlead the Argives on to battle, and leave this handful of men to rot, who scheme, and scheme in vain, to get back to\nArgos ere they have learned whether Jove be true or a liar. For the mighty son of Saturn surely promised that we\nshould succeed, when we Argives set sail to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans. He showed us favourable\nsigns by flashing his lightning on our right hands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has first lain with the\nwife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and sorrow that he has suffered for the sake of Helen. Nevertheless, if any\nman is in such haste to be at home again, let him lay his hand to his ship that he may meet his doom in the sight\nof all. But, O king, consider and give ear to my counsel, for the word that I say may not be neglected lightly. Divide\nyour men, Agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that clans and tribes may stand by and help one another.\nIf you do this, and if the Achaeans obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and peoples, are brave, and who are\ncowards; for they will vie against the other. Thus you shall also learn whether it is through the counsel of heaven or\nthe cowardice of man that you shall fail to take the town.\u201d\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \u201cNestor, you have again outdone the sons of the Achaeans in counsel. Would,\nby Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I had among them ten more such councillors, for the city of King Pri-\nam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it. But the son of Saturn afflicts me with bootless\nwranglings and strife. Achilles and I are quarrelling about this girl, in which matter I was the first to offend; if we\ncan be of one mind again, the Trojans will not stave off destruction for a day. Now, therefore, get your morning\nmeal, that our hosts join in fight. Whet well your spears; see well to the ordering of your shields; give good feeds to\nyour horses, and look your chariots carefully over, that we may do battle the livelong day; for we shall have no rest,\nnot for a moment, till night falls to part us. The bands that bear your shields shall be wet with the sweat upon your\nshoulders, your hands shall weary upon your spears, your horses shall steam in front of your chariots, and if I see\nany man shirking the fight, or trying to keep out of it at the ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a\nprey to dogs and vultures.\u201d\nThus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the waves run high before the blast of the south\nwind and break on some lofty headland, dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, as the storms from\nevery quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeans rise and hurry in all directions to their ships. There they lighted\ntheir fires at their tents and got dinner, offering sacrifice every man to one or other of the gods, and praying each\none of them that he might live to come out of the fight. Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed a fat five-year-old bull\nto the mighty son of Saturn, and invited the princes and elders of his host. First he asked Nestor and King Idome-\nneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, and sixthly Ulysses, peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of\nhis own accord, for he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood round the bull with the barley-meal in their\nhands, and Agamemnon prayed, saying, \u201cJove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven, and ridest upon the\nstorm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, nor the night fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low, and its gates\nare consumed with fire. Grant that my sword may pierce the shirt of Hector about his heart, and that full many of\nhis comrades may bite the dust as they fall dying round him.\u201d\nThus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his prayer. He accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less\nincreased their toil continually. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal upon the victim, they\ndrew back its head, killed it, and then flayed it. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers\nof fat, and set pieces of raw meat on the top of them. These they burned upon the split logs of firewood, but they\nspitted the inward meats, and held them in the flames to cook. When the thigh-bones were burned, and they had\ntasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done, and\ndrew them off; then, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his\nfull share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene,\n110 The Iliad\nbegan to speak. \u201cKing Agamemnon,\u201d said he, \u201clet us not stay talking here, nor be slack in the work that heaven has\nput into our hands. Let the heralds summon the people to gather at their several ships; we will then go about among\nthe host, that we may begin fighting at once.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sent the criers round to call the people in\nassembly. So they called them, and the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about the son of Atreus chose their\nmen and marshalled them, while Minerva went among them holding her priceless aegis that knows neither age nor\ndeath. From it there waved a hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven, and each one of them worth a hundred\noxen. With this she darted furiously everywhere among the hosts of the Achaeans, urging them forward, and put-\nting courage into the heart of each, so that he might fight and do battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeter\nin their eyes even than returning home in their ships. As when some great forest fire is raging upon a mountain\ntop and its light is seen afar, even so as they marched the gleam of their armour flashed up into the firmament of\nheaven.\nThey were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the plain about the waters of Cayster, that wing their\nway hither and thither, glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settle till the fen is alive with their scream-\ning. Even thus did their tribes pour from ships and tents on to the plain of the Scamander, and the ground rang as\nbrass under the feet of men and horses. They stood as thick upon the flower-bespangled field as leaves that bloom\nin summer.\nAs countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman\u2019s homestead in the time of spring when the pails are\ndrenched with milk, even so did the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans and destroy them.\nThe chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight began, drafting them out as easily as goatherds\ndraft their flocks when they have got mixed while feeding; and among them went King Agamemnon, with a head\nand face like Jove the lord of thunder, a waist like Mars, and a chest like that of Neptune. As some great bull that\nlords it over the herds upon the plain, even so did Jove make the son of Atreus stand peerless among the multitude\nof heroes.\nAnd now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me\u2014for you are goddesses and are in all places\nso that you see all things, while we know nothing but by report\u2014who were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans?\nAs for the common soldiers, they were so that I could not name every single one of them though I had ten tongues,\nand though my voice failed not and my heart were of bronze within me, unless you, O Olympian Muses, daughters\nof aegis-bearing Jove, were to recount them to me. Nevertheless, I will tell the captains of the ships and all the fleet\ntogether.\nPeneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were captains of the Boeotians. These were they that\ndwelt in Hyria and rocky Aulis, and who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands of Eteonus, with Thespeia,\nGraia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. They also held Harma, Eilesium, and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, and\nPeteon; Ocalea and the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the haunt of doves; Coronea, and\nthe pastures of Haliartus; Plataea and Glisas; the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus with its famous grove\nof Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon the sea. From these there came fifty\nships, and in each there were a hundred and twenty young men of the Boeotians.\nAscalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dwelt in Aspledon and Orchomenus the realm of\nMinyas. Astyoche a noble maiden bore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she had gone with Mars secret-\nly into an upper chamber, and he had lain with her. With these there came thirty ships.\nThe Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mighty Iphitus the son of Naubolus. These were\nthey that held Cyparissus, rocky Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt in Anemorea and\nHyampolis, and about the waters of the river Cephissus, and Lilaea by the springs of the Cephissus; with their chief-\ntains came forty ships, and they marshalled the forces of the Phoceans, which were stationed next to the Boeotians,\non their left.\nAjax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not so great, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son\nof Telamon. He was a little man, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use of the spear he excelled all the\nHellenes and the Achaeans. These dwelt in Cynus, Opous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae, Tarphe, and Thro-\nnium about the river Boagrius. With him there came forty ships of the Locrians who dwell beyond Euboea.\nThe fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria, Histiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea,\nand the rock-perched town of Dium; with them were also the men of Carystus and Styra; Elephenor of the race of\nMars was in command of these; he was son of Chalcodon, and chief over all the Abantes. With him they came, fleet\nof foot and wearing their hair long behind, brave warriors, who would ever strive to tear open the corslets of their\nfoes with their long ashen spears. Of these there came fifty ships.\nAnd they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of great Erechtheus, who was born of the soil itself,\nbut Jove\u2019s daughter, Minerva, fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own rich sanctuary. There, year by\nyear, the Athenian youths worship him with sacrifices of bulls and rams. These were commanded by Menestheus,\n111 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nson of Peteos. No man living could equal him in the marshalling of chariots and foot soldiers. Nestor could alone\nrival him, for he was older. With him there came fifty ships.\nAjax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongside those of the Athenians.\nThe men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns, with Hermione, and Asine upon the gulf;\nTroezene, Eionae, and the vineyard lands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who came from Aegina\nand Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loud battle-cry, and Sthenelus son of famed Capaneus. With them in\ncommand was Euryalus, son of king Mecisteus, son of Talaus; but Diomed was chief over them all. With these there\ncame eighty ships.\nThose who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae; Orneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where\nAdrastus reigned of old; Hyperesia, high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coast-land round about Helice;\nthese sent a hundred ships under the command of King Agamemnon, son of Atreus. His force was far both finest\nand most numerous, and in their midst was the king himself, all glorious in his armour of gleaming bronze\u2014fore-\nmost among the heroes, for he was the greatest king, and had most men under him.\nAnd those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills, Pharis, Sparta, with Messe the haunt of doves;\nBryseae, Augeae, Amyclae, and Helos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus; these were led by Menelaus of\nthe loud battle-cry, brother to Agamemnon, and of them there were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others.\nAmong them went Menelaus himself, strong in zeal, urging his men to fight; for he longed to avenge the toil and\nsorrow that he had suffered for the sake of Helen.\nThe men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of the river Alpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and\nAmphigenea; Pteleum, Helos, and Dorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled his minstrelsy for ever. He\nwas returning from Oechalia, where Eurytus lived and reigned, and boasted that he would surpass even the Muses,\ndaughters of aegis-bearing Jove, if they should sing against him; whereon they were angry, and maimed him. They\nrobbed him of his divine power of song, and thenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. These were commanded\nby Nestor, knight of Gerene, and with him there came ninety ships.\nAnd those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene, near the tomb of Aepytus, where the people\nfight hand to hand; the men of Pheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of Rhipae, Stratie, and bleak Enispe;\nof Tegea and fair Mantinea; of Stymphelus and Parrhasia; of these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus was commander,\nand they had sixty ships. Many Arcadians, good soldiers, came in each one of them, but Agamemnon found them\nthe ships in which to cross the sea, for they were not a people that occupied their business upon the waters.\nThe men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as is enclosed between Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon\nthe sea-shore, the rock Olene and Alesium. These had four leaders, and each of them had ten ships, with many\nEpeans on board. Their captains were Amphimachus and Thalpius\u2014the one, son of Cteatus, and the other, of Eury-\ntus\u2014both of the race of Actor. The two others were Diores, son of Amarynces, and Polyxenus, son of King Agasthe-\nnes, son of Augeas.\nAnd those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who dwelt beyond the sea off Elis; these were led by\nMeges, peer of Mars, and the son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who quarrelled with his father, and went to settle\nin Dulichium. With him there came forty ships.\nUlysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum with its forests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips,\nSamos and Zacynthus, with the mainland also that was over against the islands. These were led by Ulysses, peer of\nJove in counsel, and with him there came twelve ships.\nThoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in Pleuron, Olenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the\nsea, and rocky Calydon, for the great king Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, as was also gold-\nen-haired Meleager, who had been set over the Aetolians to be their king. And with Thoas there came forty ships.\nThe famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus, and the well-walled city of Gortys;\nLyctus also, Miletus and Lycastus that lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestus and Rhytium, with the\nother peoples that dwelt in the hundred cities of Crete. All these were led by Idomeneus, and by Meriones, peer of\nmurderous Mars. And with these there came eighty ships.\nTlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large of stature, brought nine ships of lordly warriors from\nRhodes. These dwelt in Rhodes which is divided among the three cities of Lindus, Ielysus, and Cameirus, that\nlies upon the chalk. These were commanded by Tlepolemus, son of Hercules by Astyochea, whom he had carried\noff from Ephyra, on the river Selleis, after sacking many cities of valiant warriors. When Tlepolemus grew up, he\nkilled his father\u2019s uncle Licymnius, who had been a famous warrior in his time, but was then grown old. On this\nhe built himself a fleet, gathered a great following, and fled beyond the sea, for he was menaced by the other sons\nand grandsons of Hercules. After a voyage. during which he suffered great hardship, he came to Rhodes, where the\npeople divided into three communities, according to their tribes, and were dearly loved by Jove, the lord, of gods\nand men; wherefore the son of Saturn showered down great riches upon them.\nAnd Nireus brought three ships from Syme\u2014Nireus, who was the handsomest man that came up under Ilius of\n112 The Iliad\nall the Danaans after the son of Peleus\u2014but he was a man of no substance, and had but a small following.\nAnd those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, the city of Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands,\nthese were commanded by Pheidippus and Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus the son of Hercules. And with\nthem there came thirty ships.\nThose again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis; and those of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair\nwomen, who were called Myrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships, over which Achilles was in\ncommand. But they now took no part in the war, inasmuch as there was no one to marshal them; for Achilles stayed\nby his ships, furious about the loss of the girl Briseis, whom he had taken from Lyrnessus at his own great peril,\nwhen he had sacked Lyrnessus and Thebe, and had overthrown Mynes and Epistrophus, sons of king Evenor, son of\nSelepus. For her sake Achilles was still grieving, but ere long he was again to join them.\nAnd those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus, sanctuary of Ceres; Iton, the mother of\nsheep; Antrum upon the sea, and Pteleum that lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave Protesilaus had been cap-\ntain while he was yet alive, but he was now lying under the earth. He had left a wife behind him in Phylace to tear\nher cheeks in sorrow, and his house was only half finished, for he was slain by a Dardanian warrior while leaping\nforemost of the Achaeans upon the soil of Troy. Still, though his people mourned their chieftain, they were not\nwithout a leader, for Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalled them; he was son of Iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was\nthe son of Phylacus, and he was own brother to Protesilaus, only younger, Protesilaus being at once the elder and\nthe more valiant. So the people were not without a leader, though they mourned him whom they had lost. With\nhim there came forty ships.\nAnd those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe, Glaphyrae, and the populous city of Iolcus, these\nwith their eleven ships were led by Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis bore to him, loveliest of the daughters\nof Pelias.\nAnd those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea and rugged Olizon, these were led by the skilful\narcher Philoctetes, and they had seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them good archers; but Philoctetes was\nlying in great pain in the Island of Lemnos, where the sons of the Achaeans left him, for he had been bitten by a\npoisonous water snake. There he lay sick and sorry, and full soon did the Argives come to miss him. But his people,\nthough they felt his loss were not leaderless, for Medon, the bastard son of Oileus by Rhene, set them in array.\nThose, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and they that held Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eury-\ntus, these were commanded by the two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art of healing, Podalirius and Machaon.\nAnd with them there came thirty ships.\nThe men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia, with those that held Asterius, and the white\ncrests of Titanus, these were led by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them there came forty ships.\nThose that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white city of Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes\nwas leader. He was son of Pirithous, who was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia bore him to Pirithous on the\nday when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountain savages and drove them from Mt. Pelion to the Aithices. But\nPolypoetes was not sole in command, for with him was Leonteus, of the race of Mars, who was son of Coronus, the\nson of Caeneus. And with these there came forty ships.\nGuneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was followed by the Enienes and the valiant Per-\naebi, who dwelt about wintry Dodona, and held the lands round the lovely river Titaresius, which sends its waters\ninto the Peneus. They do not mingle with the silver eddies of the Peneus, but flow on the top of them like oil; for the\nTitaresius is a branch of dread Orcus and of the river Styx.\nOf the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They were they that dwelt about the river Pene-\nus and Mt. Pelion. Prothous, fleet of foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty ships.\nSuch were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, O Muse, was the foremost, whether man or horse,\namong those that followed after the sons of Atreus?\nOf the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest. They were driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet\nas birds. They were of the same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height. Apollo, of the silver bow, had bred\nthem in Perea\u2014both of them mares, and terrible as Mars in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, was much\nthe foremost so long as Achilles\u2019 anger lasted, for Achilles excelled him greatly and he had also better horses; but\nAchilles was now holding aloof at his ships by reason of his quarrel with Agamemnon, and his people passed their\ntime upon the sea shore, throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark, and in archery. Their horses stood each by\nhis own chariot, champing lotus and wild celery. The chariots were housed under cover, but their owners, for lack of\nleadership, wandered hither and thither about the host and went not forth to fight.\nThus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth groaned beneath them when the lord of thunder is\nangry and lashes the land about Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus lies. Even so did the earth\ngroan beneath them as they sped over the plain.\nAnd now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the bad news among the Trojans. They were gathered in\n113 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nassembly, old and young, at Priam\u2019s gates, and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with the voice of Priam\u2019s son\nPolites, who, being fleet of foot, was stationed as watchman for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aesyetes, to look out\nfor any sally of the Achaeans. In his likeness Iris spoke, saying, \u201cOld man, you talk idly, as in time of peace, while\nwar is at hand. I have been in many a battle, but never yet saw such a host as is now advancing. They are crossing\nthe plain to attack the city as thick as leaves or as the sands of the sea. Hector, I charge you above all others, do as I\nsay. There are many allies dispersed about the city of Priam from distant places and speaking divers tongues. There-\nfore, let each chief give orders to his own people, setting them severally in array and leading them forth to battle.\u201d\nThus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at once broke up the assembly. The men flew to\narms; all the gates were opened, and the people thronged through them, horse and foot, with the tramp as of a great\nmultitude.\nNow there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon the plain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know\nthat it is the tomb of lithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided their forces.\nPriam\u2019s son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the Trojans, and with him were arrayed by far\nthe greater number and most valiant of those who were longing for the fray.\nThe Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore to Anchises, when she, goddess though she was,\nhad lain with him upon the mountain slopes of Ida. He was not alone, for with him were the two sons of Antenor,\nArchilochus and Acamas, both skilled in all the arts of war.\nThey that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men of substance, who drink the limpid waters of\nthe Aesepus, and are of Trojan blood\u2014these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom Apollo had taught to use\nthe bow.\nThey that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia, and the high mountain of Tereia\u2014these were\nled by Adrestus and Amphius, whose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Merops of Percote, who ex-\ncelled in all kinds of divination. He told them not to take part in the war, but they gave him no heed, for fate lured\nthem to destruction.\nThey that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos, and Arisbe\u2014these were led by Asius, son of\nHyrtacus, a brave commander\u2014Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay steeds, of the breed that\ncomes from the river Selleis, had brought from Arisbe.\nHippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in fertile Larissa\u2014Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the\nrace of Mars, two sons of the Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus.\nAcamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and those that came from beyond the mighty\nstream of the Hellespont.\nEuphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of the Ciconian spearsmen.\nPyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the broad waters of the river Axius, the fairest\nthat flow upon the earth.\nThe Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes from Enetae, where the mules run wild in\nherds. These were they that held Cytorus and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by the river Parthenius,\nCromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini.\nOdius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from distant Alybe, where there are mines of silver.\nChromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill in augury availed not to save him from destruc-\ntion, for he fell by the hand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he slew others also of the Trojans.\nPhorcys, again, and noble Ascanius led the Phrygians from the far country of Ascania, and both were eager for\nthe fray.\nMesthles and Antiphus commanded the Meonians, sons of Talaemenes, born to him of the Gygaean lake. These\nled the Meonians, who dwelt under Mt. Tmolus.\nNastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held Miletus and the wooded mountain of Phthires, with\nthe water of the river Maeander and the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These were commanded by Nastes and Amphi-\nmachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He came into the fight with gold about him, like a girl; fool that he was, his gold\nwas of no avail to save him, for he fell in the river by the hand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, and Achilles bore\naway his gold.\nSarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land, by the eddying waters of the Xanthus.\nBook III\nWhen the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain, the Trojans advanced as a flight of wild\nfowl or cranes that scream overhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing waters of Oceanus to bring\ndeath and destruction on the Pygmies, and they wrangle in the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched silently, in\nhigh heart, and minded to stand by one another.\n114 The Iliad\nAs when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountain tops, bad for shepherds but better than\nnight for thieves, and a man can see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dust from under their\nfeet as they made all speed over the plain.\nWhen they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward as champion on the Trojan side. On his\nshoulders he bore the skin of a panther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears shod with bronze as\na challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to meet him in single fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before the\nranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase of some goat or horned stag, and devours it there and\nthen, though dogs and youths set upon him. Even thus was Menelaus glad when his eyes caught sight of Alex-\nandrus, for he deemed that now he should be revenged. He sprang, therefore, from his chariot, clad in his suit of\narmour.\nAlexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank in fear of his life under cover of his men.\nAs one who starts back affrighted, trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in some moun-\ntain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into the throng of Trojan warriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the son\nAtreus.\nThen Hector upbraided him. \u201cParis,\u201d said he, \u201cevil-hearted Paris, fair to see, but woman-mad, and false of\ntongue, would that you had never been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live to be disgraced and\nlooked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock at us and say that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to see\nbut who has neither wit nor courage? Did you not, such as you are, get your following together and sail beyond the\nseas? Did you not from your a far country carry off a lovely woman wedded among a people of warriors\u2014to bring\nsorrow upon your father, your city, and your whole country, but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness\nto yourself? And now can you not dare face Menelaus and learn what manner of man he is whose wife you have\nstolen? Where indeed would be your lyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour, when you\nwere lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are a weak-kneed people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of\nstones for the wrongs you have done them.\u201d\nAnd Alexandrus answered, \u201cHector, your rebuke is just. You are hard as the axe which a shipwright wields at his\nwork, and cleaves the timber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge of your scorn. Still, taunt me\nnot with the gifts that golden Venus has given me; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the gods give\nthem where they are minded, and none can have them for the asking. If you would have me do battle with Mene-\nlaus, bid the Trojans and Achaeans take their seats, while he and I fight in their midst for Helen and all her wealth.\nLet him who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his\nhome, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the\nothers go home to Argos and the land of the Achaeans.\u201d\nWhen Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the Trojan ranks holding his spear by the middle\nto keep them back, and they all sat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed at him with stones and arrows,\ntill Agamemnon shouted to them saying, \u201cHold, Argives, shoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires to speak.\u201d\nThey ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. \u201cHear from my mouth,\u201d said he, \u201cTrojans and\nAchaeans, the saying of Alexandrus, through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and Achaeans\nlay their armour upon the ground, while he and Menelaus fight in the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let\nhim who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his own\nhome, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace.\u201d\nThus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of the loud battle-cry addressed them. \u201cAnd now,\u201d\nhe said, \u201chear me too, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of Achaeans and Trojans is at\nhand, as well it may be, seeing how much have suffered for my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he did me.\nLet him who shall die, die, and let the others fight no more. Bring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a black ewe,\nfor Earth and Sun, and we will bring a third for Jove. Moreover, you shall bid Priam come, that he may swear to the\ncovenant himself; for his sons are high-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Jove must not be transgressed or\ntaken in vain. Young men\u2019s minds are light as air, but when an old man comes he looks before and after, deeming\nthat which shall be fairest upon both sides.\u201d\nThe Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they thought that they should now have rest.\nThey backed their chariots toward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying it down upon the\nground; and the hosts were near to one another with a little space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the\ncity to bring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybius to fetch the other lamb from the\nships, and he did as Agamemnon had said.\nMeanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law, wife of the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son\nof Antenor, had married Laodice, the fairest of Priam\u2019s daughters. She found her in her own room, working at a\ngreat web of purple linen, on which she was embroidering the battles between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars\nhad made them fight for her sake. Iris then came close up to her and said, \u201cCome hither, child, and see the strange\n115 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ndoings of the Trojans and Achaeans till now they have been warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle, but\nnow they have left off fighting, and are leaning upon their shields, sitting still with their spears planted beside them.\nAlexandrus and Menelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are to the the wife of him who is the victor.\u201d\nThus spoke the goddess, and Helen\u2019s heart yearned after her former husband, her city, and her parents. She\nthrew a white mantle over her head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone, but attended by\ntwo of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus, and Clymene. And straightway they were at the Scaean gates.\nThe two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were seated by the Scaean gates, with Priam, Pan-\nthous, Thymoetes, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old to fight, but they were\nfluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicales that chirrup delicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood.\nWhen they saw Helen coming towards the tower, they said softly to one another, \u201cSmall wonder that Trojans and\nAchaeans should endure so much and so long, for the sake of a woman so marvellously and divinely lovely. Still, fair\nthough she be, let them take her and go, or she will breed sorrow for us and for our children after us.\u201d\nBut Priam bade her draw nigh. \u201cMy child,\u201d said he, \u201ctake your seat in front of me that you may see your former\nhusband, your kinsmen and your friends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you who are to blame. It is\nthey that have brought about this terrible war with the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great\nand goodly? I have seen men taller by a head, but none so comely and so royal. Surely he must be a king.\u201d\n\u201cSir,\u201d answered Helen, \u201cfather of my husband, dear and reverend in my eyes, would that I had chosen death\nrather than to have come here with your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darling daughter, and all\nthe companions of my girlhood. But it was not to be, and my lot is one of tears and sorrow. As for your question,\nthe hero of whom you ask is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, a good king and a brave soldier, brother-in-law as surely\nas that he lives, to my abhorred and miserable self.\u201d\nThe old man marvelled at him and said, \u201cHappy son of Atreus, child of good fortune. I see that the Achaeans\nare subject to you in great multitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people of Otreus and of\nMygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river Sangarius; I was their ally, and with them when the Ama-\nzons, peers of men, came up against them, but even they were not so many as the Achaeans.\u201d\nThe old man next looked upon Ulysses; \u201cTell me,\u201d he said, \u201cwho is that other, shorter by a head than Agamem-\nnon, but broader across the chest and shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalks in front of the\nranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his ewes.\u201d\nAnd Helen answered, \u201cHe is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son of Laertes. He was born in rugged Ithaca, and\nexcels in all manner of stratagems and subtle cunning.\u201d\nOn this Antenor said, \u201cMadam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses once came here as envoy about yourself, and\nMenelaus with him. I received them in my own house, and therefore know both of them by sight and conversation.\nWhen they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans, Menelaus was the broader shouldered, but when both\nwere seated Ulysses had the more royal presence. After a time they delivered their message, and the speech of Me-\nnelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; he did not say much, for he was a man of few words, but he spoke very clearly\nand to the point, though he was the younger man of the two; Ulysses, on the other hand, when he rose to speak, was\nat first silent and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor graceful movement of his sceptre; he\nkept it straight and stiff like a man unpractised in oratory\u2014one might have taken him for a mere churl or simple-\nton; but when he raised his voice, and the words came driving from his deep chest like winter snow before the wind,\nthen there was none to touch him, and no man thought further of what he looked like.\u201d\nPriam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, \u201cWho is that great and goodly warrior whose head and broad shoul-\nders tower above the rest of the Argives?\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d answered Helen, \u201cis huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, and on the other side of him, among the\nCretans, stands Idomeneus looking like a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him. Often did Menelaus\nreceive him as a guest in our house when he came visiting us from Crete. I see, moreover, many other Achaeans\nwhose names I could tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find, Castor, breaker of horses, and Pollux the\nmighty boxer; they are children of my mother, and own brothers to myself. Either they have not left Lacedaemon,\nor else, though they have brought their ships, they will not show themselves in battle for the shame and disgrace\nthat I have brought upon them.\u201d\nShe knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the earth in their own land of Lacedaemon.\nMeanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings through the city\u2014two lambs and a goatskin of\nwine, the gift of earth; and Idaeus brought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up to Priam and said,\n\u201cSon of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans and Achaeans bid you come down on to the plain and swear to a\nsolemn covenant. Alexandrus and Menelaus are to fight for Helen in single combat, that she and all her wealth may\ngo with him who is the victor. We are to swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby we others shall dwell here in\nTroy, while the Achaeans return to Argos and the land of the Achaeans.\u201d\nThe old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the horses, and they made all haste to do so. He\n116 The Iliad\nmounted the chariot, gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside him; they then drove through\nthe Scaean gates on to the plain. When they reached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left the chariot,\nand with measured pace advanced into the space between the hosts.\nAgamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants brought on the oath-offerings and mixed the\nwine in the mixing-bowls; they poured water over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreus drew the dag-\nger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs\u2019 heads; this the men-servants gave about among the Trojan\nand Achaean princes, and the son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer. \u201cFather Jove,\u201d he cried, \u201cthat rulest in Ida,\nmost glorious in power, and thou oh Sun, that seest and givest ear to all things, Earth and Rivers, and ye who in the\nrealms below chastise the soul of him that has broken his oath, witness these rites and guard them, that they be not\nvain. If Alexandrus kills Menelaus, let him keep Helen and all her wealth, while we sail home with our ships; but if\nMenelaus kills Alexandrus, let the Trojans give back Helen and all that she has; let them moreover pay such fine to\nthe Achaeans as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among those that shall be born hereafter. Aid if Priam and his\nsons refuse such fine when Alexandrus has fallen, then will I stay here and fight on till I have got satisfaction.\u201d\nAs he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, and laid them down gasping and dying upon the\nground, for the knife had reft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from the mixing-bowl into the cups,\nand prayed to the everlasting gods, saying, Trojans and Achaeans among one another, \u201cJove, most great and glori-\nous, and ye other everlasting gods, grant that the brains of them who shall first sin against their oaths\u2014of them and\ntheir children\u2014may be shed upon the ground even as this wine, and let their wives become the slaves of strangers.\u201d\nThus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer. Then Priam, descendant of Dardanus,\nspoke, saying, \u201cHear me, Trojans and Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius: I dare not with\nmy own eyes witness this fight between my son and Menelaus, for Jove and the other immortals alone know which\nshall fall.\u201d\nOn this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. He gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor\nsat beside him; the two then went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, and cast lots from a hel-\nmet of bronze to see which should take aim first. Meanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayed saying,\n\u201cFather Jove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, grant that he who first brought about this war between us\nmay die, and enter the house of Hades, while we others remain at peace and abide by our oaths.\u201d\nGreat Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet, and the lot of Paris flew out first. The others\ntook their several stations, each by his horses and the place where his arms were lying, while Alexandrus, husband\nof lovely Helen, put on his goodly armour. First he greaved his legs with greaves of good make and fitted with\nancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of his brother Lycaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung\nhis silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his\nhelmet, well-wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped a redoubtable\nspear that suited his hands. In like fashion Menelaus also put on his armour.\nWhen they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode fierce of aspect into the open space, and\nboth Trojans and Achaeans were struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another on the mea-\nsured ground, brandishing their spears, and each furious against the other. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck the\nround shield of the son of Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus next took\naim, praying to Father Jove as he did so. \u201cKing Jove,\u201d he said, \u201cgrant me revenge on Alexandrus who has wronged\nme; subdue him under my hand that in ages yet to come a man may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house of his\nhost.\u201d\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of Alexandrus. Through shield and cuirass it went,\nand tore the shirt by his flank, but Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life. Then the son of Atreus drew\nhis sword, and drove at the projecting part of his helmet, but the sword fell shivered in three or four pieces from his\nhand, and he cried, looking towards Heaven, \u201cFather Jove, of all gods thou art the most despiteful; I made sure of\nmy revenge, but the sword has broken in my hand, my spear has been hurled in vain, and I have not killed him.\u201d\nWith this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plume of his helmet, and began dragging him to-\nwards the Achaeans. The strap of the helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and Menelaus would have\ndragged him off to his own great glory had not Jove\u2019s daughter Venus been quick to mark and to break the strap of\noxhide, so that the empty helmet came away in his hand. This he flung to his comrades among the Achaeans, and\nwas again springing upon Alexandrus to run him through with a spear, but Venus snatched him up in a moment\n(as a god can do), hid him under a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him to his own bedchamber.\nThen she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with the Trojan women crowding round her. She\ntook the form of an old woman who used to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and of whom she\nwas very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her by perfumed robe and said, \u201cCome hither; Alexandrus says you are\nto go to the house; he is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed in gorgeous apparel. No one\nwould think he had just come from fighting, but rather that he was going to a dance, or had done dancing and was\n117 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nsitting down.\u201d\nWith these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she marked the beautiful neck of the goddess,\nher lovely bosom, and sparkling eyes, she marvelled at her and said, \u201cGoddess, why do you thus beguile me? Are\nyou going to send me afield still further to some man whom you have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Mene-\nlaus has just vanquished Alexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back with him. You are come here to betray me.\nGo sit with Alexandrus yourself; henceforth be goddess no longer; never let your feet carry you back to Olympus;\nworry about him and look after him till he make you his wife, or, for the matter of that, his slave\u2014but me? I shall\nnot go; I can garnish his bed no longer; I should be a by-word among all the women of Troy. Besides, I have trouble\non my mind.\u201d\nVenus was very angry, and said, \u201cBold hussy, do not provoke me; if you do, I shall leave you to your fate and\nhate you as much as I have loved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans and Achaeans, and you shall come\nto a bad end.\u201d\nAt this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her and went in silence, following the goddess and\nunnoticed by the Trojan women.\nWhen they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set about their work, but Helen went into her\nown room, and the laughter-loving goddess took a seat and set it for her facing Alexandrus. On this Helen, daugh-\nter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down, and with eyes askance began to upbraid her husband.\n\u201cSo you are come from the fight,\u201d said she; \u201cwould that you had fallen rather by the hand of that brave man who\nwas my husband. You used to brag that you were a better man with hands and spear than Menelaus. go, but I then,\nan challenge him again\u2014but I should advise you not to do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet him in single\ncombat, you will soon all by his spear.\u201d\nAnd Paris answered, \u201cWife, do not vex me with your reproaches. This time, with the help of Minerva, Mene-\nlaus has vanquished me; another time I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that will stand by me. Come, let\nus lie down together and make friends. Never yet was I so passionately enamoured of you as at this moment\u2014not\neven when I first carried you off from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you\u2014not even when I had converse with\nyou upon the couch of love in the island of Cranae was I so enthralled by desire of you as now.\u201d On this he led her\ntowards the bed, and his wife went with him.\nThus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus strode among the throng, looking every-\nwhere for Alexandrus, and no man, neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If they had seen him\nthey were in no mind to hide him, for they all of them hated him as they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of\nmen, spoke, saying, \u201cHear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. The victory has been with Menelaus; therefore give\nback Helen with all her wealth, and pay such fine as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among them that shall be\nborn hereafter.\u201d\nThus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in applause.\nBook IV\nNow the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden floor while Hebe went round pouring out\nnectar for them to drink, and as they pledged one another in their cups of gold they looked down upon the town of\nTroy. The son of Saturn then began to tease Juno, talking at her so as to provoke her. \u201cMenelaus,\u201d said he, \u201chas two\ngood friends among the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and Minerva of Alalcomene, but they only sit still and look on,\nwhile Venus keeps ever by Alexandrus\u2019 side to defend him in any danger; indeed she has just rescued him when he\nmade sure that it was all over with him\u2014for the victory really did lie with Menelaus. We must consider what we\nshall do about all this; shall we set them fighting anew or make peace between them? If you will agree to this last\nMenelaus can take back Helen and the city of Priam may remain still inhabited.\u201d\nMinerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by side hatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva\nscowled at her father, for she was in a furious passion with him, and said nothing, but Juno could not contain her-\nself. \u201cDread son of Saturn,\u201d said she, \u201cwhat, pray, is the meaning of all this? Is my trouble, then, to go for nothing,\nand the sweat that I have sweated, to say nothing of my horses, while getting the people together against Priam and\nhis children? Do as you will, but we other gods shall not all of us approve your counsel.\u201d\nJove was angry and answered, \u201cMy dear, what harm have Priam and his sons done you that you are so hotly\nbent on sacking the city of Ilius? Will nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eat Priam raw, with\nhis sons and all the other Trojans to boot? Have it your own way then; for I would not have this matter become a\nbone of contention between us. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, if ever I want to sack a city belonging\nto friends of yours, you must not try to stop me; you will have to let me do it, for I am giving in to you sorely against\nmy will. Of all inhabited cities under the sun and stars of heaven, there was none that I so much respected as Ilius\nwith Priam and his whole people. Equitable feasts were never wanting about my altar, nor the savour of burning fat,\n118 The Iliad\nwhich is honour due to ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cMy own three favourite cities,\u201d answered Juno, \u201care Argos, Sparta, and Mycenae. Sack them whenever you may\nbe displeased with them. I shall not defend them and I shall not care. Even if I did, and tried to stay you, I should\ntake nothing by it, for you are much stronger than I am, but I will not have my own work wasted. I too am a god\nand of the same race with yourself. I am Saturn\u2019s eldest daughter, and am honourable not on this ground only, but\nalso because I am your wife, and you are king over the gods. Let it be a case, then, of give-and-take between us, and\nthe rest of the gods will follow our lead. Tell Minerva to go and take part in the fight at once, and let her contrive\nthat the Trojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the Achaeans.\u201d\nThe sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva, \u201cGo at once into the Trojan and Achaean\nhosts, and contrive that the Trojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the Achaeans.\u201d\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus.\nShe shot through the sky as some brilliant meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent as a sign to mariners\nor to some great army, and a fiery train of light follows in its wake. The Trojans and Achaeans were struck with awe\nas they beheld, and one would turn to his neighbour, saying, \u201cEither we shall again have war and din of combat, or\nJove the lord of battle will now make peace between us.\u201d\nThus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus, son of Antenor, and went through the ranks\nof the Trojans to find Pandarus, the redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standing among the stalwart heroes\nwho had followed him from the banks of the Aesopus, so she went close up to him and said, \u201cBrave son of Lycaon,\nwill you do as I tell you? If you dare send an arrow at Menelaus you will win honour and thanks from all the Tro-\njans, and especially from prince Alexandrus\u2014he would be the first to requite you very handsomely if he could see\nMenelaus mount his funeral pyre, slain by an arrow from your hand. Take your home aim then, and pray to Lycian\nApollo, the famous archer; vow that when you get home to your strong city of Zelea you will offer a hecatomb of\nfirstling lambs in his honour.\u201d\nHis fool\u2019s heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its case. This bow was made from the horns of a wild\nibex which he had killed as it was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and it had fallen as the arrow struck it to\nthe heart. Its horns were sixteen palms long, and a worker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them well\ndown, and giving them tips of gold. When Pandarus had strung his bow he laid it carefully on the ground, and his\nbrave followers held their shields before him lest the Achaeans should set upon him before he had shot Menelaus.\nThen he opened the lid of his quiver and took out a winged arrow that had yet been shot, fraught with the pangs\nof death. He laid the arrow on the string and prayed to Lycian Apollo, the famous archer, vowing that when he got\nhome to his strong city of Zelea he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour. He laid the notch of the\narrow on the oxhide bowstring, and drew both notch and string to his breast till the arrow-head was near the bow;\nthen when the bow was arched into a half-circle he let fly, and the bow twanged, and the string sang as the arrow\nflew gladly on over the heads of the throng.\nBut the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove\u2019s daughter, driver of the spoil, was the first to\nstand before thee and ward off the piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as a mother whisks a fly from off her\nchild when it is sleeping sweetly; she guided it to the part where the golden buckles of the belt that passed over his\ndouble cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struck the belt that went tightly round him. It went right through this\nand through the cuirass of cunning workmanship; it also pierced the belt beneath it, which he wore next his skin to\nkeep out darts or arrows; it was this that served him in the best stead, nevertheless the arrow went through it and\ngrazed the top of the skin, so that blood began flowing from the wound.\nAs when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to a piece of ivory that is to be the cheek-piece\nof a horse, and is to be laid up in a treasure house \u2014 many a knight is fain to bear it, but the king keeps it as an\nornament of which both horse and driver may be proud\u2014even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs and your\nlegs down to your fair ancles stained with blood.\nWhen King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was afraid, and so was brave Menelaus\nhimself till he saw that the barbs of the arrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to the shaft were still\noutside the wound. Then he took heart, but Agamemnon heaved a deep sigh as he held Menelaus\u2019s hand in his\nown, and his comrades made moan in concert. \u201cDear brother, \u201che cried, \u201cI have been the death of you in pledging\nthis covenant and letting you come forward as our champion. The Trojans have trampled on their oaths and have\nwounded you; nevertheless the oath, the blood of lambs, the drink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship in\nwhich have put our trust shall not be vain. If he that rules Olympus fulfil it not here and now, he will yet fulfil it\nhereafter, and they shall pay dearly with their lives and with their wives and children. The day will surely come\nwhen mighty Ilius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam\u2019s people, when the son of Saturn from his high throne\nshall overshadow them with his awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery. This shall surely be; but how,\nMenelaus, shall I mourn you, if it be your lot now to die? I should return to Argos as a by-word, for the Achaeans\nwill at once go home. We shall leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, and the earth will rot\n119 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nyour bones as you lie here at Troy with your purpose not fulfilled. Then shall some braggart Trojan leap upon your\ntomb and say, \u2018Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak his vengeance; he brought his army in vain; he is gone home to\nhis own land with empty ships, and has left Menelaus behind him.\u2019 Thus will one of them say, and may the earth\nthen swallow me.\u201d\nBut Menelaus reassured him and said, \u201cTake heart, and do not alarm the people; the arrow has not struck me\nin a mortal part, for my outer belt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass and the belt of mail\nwhich the bronze-smiths made me.\u201d\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \u201cI trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be even so, but the surgeon shall examine your\nwound and lay herbs upon it to relieve your pain.\u201d\nHe then said to Talthybius, \u201cTalthybius, tell Machaon, son to the great physician, Aesculapius, to come and see\nMenelaus immediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to our dismay, and to his\nown great glory.\u201d\nTalthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to find Machaon. Presently he found standing\namid the brave warriors who had followed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him and said, \u201cSon of Aescu-\nlapius, King Agamemnon says you are to come and see Menelaus immediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has\nwounded him with an arrow to our dismay and to his own great glory.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passed through the spreading host of the Achaeans\nand went on till they came to the place where Menelaus had been wounded and was lying with the chieftains gath-\nered in a circle round him. Machaon passed into the middle of the ring and at once drew the arrow from the belt,\nbending its barbs back through the force with which he pulled it out. He undid the burnished belt, and beneath this\nthe cuirass and the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths had made; then, when he had seen the wound, he wiped\naway the blood and applied some soothing drugs which Chiron had given to Aesculapius out of the good will he\nbore him.\nWhile they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came forward against them, for they had put on their\narmour, and now renewed the fight.\nYou would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and unwilling to fight, but eager rather for\nthe fray. He left his chariot rich with bronze and his panting steeds in charge of Eurymedon, son of Ptolemaeus the\nson of Peiraeus, and bade him hold them in readiness against the time his limbs should weary of going about and\ngiving orders to so many, for he went among the ranks on foot. When he saw men hasting to the front he stood by\nthem and cheered them on. \u201cArgives,\u201d said he, \u201cslacken not one whit in your onset; father Jove will be no helper of\nliars; the Trojans have been the first to break their oaths and to attack us; therefore they shall be devoured of vul-\ntures; we shall take their city and carry off their wives and children in our ships.\u201d\nBut he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined to fight. \u201cArgives,\u201d he cried, \u201ccowardly\nmiserable creatures, have you no shame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when they can no longer scud over\nthe plain, huddle together, but show no fight? You are as dazed and spiritless as deer. Would you wait till the Trojans\nreach the sterns of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see, whether the son of Saturn will hold his hand over you\nto protect you?\u201d\nThus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passing through the crowd, he came presently on the\nCretans, arming round Idomeneus, who was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while Meriones was bringing up the\nbattalions that were in the rear. Agamemnon was glad when he saw him, and spoke him fairly. \u201cIdomeneus,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cI treat you with greater distinction than I do any others of the Achaeans, whether in war or in other things, or\nat table. When the princes are mixing my choicest wines in the mixing-bowls, they have each of them a fixed al-\nlowance, but your cup is kept always full like my own, that you may drink whenever you are minded. Go, therefore,\ninto battle, and show yourself the man you have been always proud to be.\u201d\nIdomeneus answered, \u201cI will be a trusty comrade, as I promised you from the first I would be. Urge on the other\nAchaeans, that we may join battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon their covenants. Death and destruc-\ntion shall be theirs, seeing they have been the first to break their oaths and to attack us.\u201d\nThe son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the two Ajaxes arming themselves amid a host\nof foot-soldiers. As when a goat-herd from some high post watches a storm drive over the deep before the west\nwind\u2014black as pitch is the offing and a mighty whirlwind draws towards him, so that he is afraid and drives his\nflock into a cave\u2014even thus did the ranks of stalwart youths move in a dark mass to battle under the Ajaxes, horrid\nwith shield and spear. Glad was King Agamemnon when he saw them. \u201cNo need,\u201d he cried, \u201cto give orders to such\nleaders of the Argives as you are, for of your own selves you spur your men on to fight with might and main. Would,\nby father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo that all were so minded as you are, for the city of Priam would then soon fall\nbeneath our hands, and we should sack it.\u201d\nWith this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile speaker of the Pylians, who was marshalling his\nmen and urging them on, in company with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and Bias shepherd of his peo-\n120 The Iliad\nple. He placed his knights with their chariots and horses in the front rank, while the foot-soldiers, brave men and\nmany, whom he could trust, were in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle, that they might fight whether\nthey would or no. He gave his orders to the knights first, bidding them hold their horses well in hand, so as to avoid\nconfusion. \u201cLet no man,\u201d he said, \u201crelying on his strength or horsemanship, get before the others and engage singly\nwith the Trojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your attack; but let each when he meets an enemy\u2019s\nchariot throw his spear from his own; this be much the best; this is how the men of old took towns and strongholds;\nin this wise were they minded.\u201d\nThus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight, and King Agamemnon was glad. \u201cI wish,\u201d he\nsaid to him, that your limbs were as supple and your strength as sure as your judgment is; but age, the common enemy\nof mankind, has laid his hand upon you; would that it had fallen upon some other, and that you were still young.\u201d\nAnd Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, \u201cSon of Atreus, I too would gladly be the man I was when I slew\nmighty Ereuthalion; but the gods will not give us everything at one and the same time. I was then young, and now I\nam old; still I can go with my knights and give them that counsel which old men have a right to give. The wielding\nof the spear I leave to those who are younger and stronger than myself.\u201d\nAgamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus, son of Peteos, tarrying in his place,\nand with him were the Athenians loud of tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunning Ulysses, with his sturdy\nCephallenians round him; they had not yet heard the battle-cry, for the ranks of Trojans and Achaeans had only just\nbegun to move, so they were standing still, waiting for some other columns of the Achaeans to attack the Trojans\nand begin the fighting. When he saw this Agamemnon rebuked them and said, \u201cSon of Peteos, and you other,\nsteeped in cunning, heart of guile, why stand you here cowering and waiting on others? You two should be of all\nmen foremost when there is hard fighting to be done, for you are ever foremost to accept my invitation when we\ncouncillors of the Achaeans are holding feast. You are glad enough then to take your fill of roast meats and to drink\nwine as long as you please, whereas now you would not care though you saw ten columns of Achaeans engage the\nenemy in front of you.\u201d\nUlysses glared at him and answered, \u201cSon of Atreus, what are you talking about? How can you say that we are\nslack? When the Achaeans are in full fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if you care to do so, that the father of\nTelemachus will join battle with the foremost of them. You are talking idly.\u201d\nWhen Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly at him and withdrew his words. \u201cUlysses,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cnoble son of Laertes, excellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to find nor orders to give you, for\nI know your heart is right, and that you and I are of a mind. Enough; I will make you amends for what I have said,\nand if any ill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing.\u201d\nHe then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son of Tydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his\nchariot and horses, with Sthenelus the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began to upbraid him. \u201cSon of\nTydeus,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy stand you cowering here upon the brink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was ever\nahead of his men when leading them on against the foe\u2014so, at least, say they that saw him in battle, for I never set\neyes upon him myself. They say that there was no man like him. He came once to Mycenae, not as an enemy but as\na guest, in company with Polynices to recruit his forces, for they were levying war against the strong city of The-\nbes, and prayed our people for a body of picked men to help them. The men of Mycenae were willing to let them\nhave one, but Jove dissuaded them by showing them unfavourable omens. Tydeus, therefore, and Polynices went\ntheir way. When they had got as far the deep-meadowed and rush-grown banks of the Aesopus, the Achaeans sent\nTydeus as their envoy, and he found the Cadmeans gathered in great numbers to a banquet in the house of Eteocles.\nStranger though he was, he knew no fear on finding himself single-handed among so many, but challenged them\nto contests of all kinds, and in each one of them was at once victorious, so mightily did Minerva help him. The\nCadmeans were incensed at his success, and set a force of fifty youths with two captains\u2014the godlike hero Maeon,\nson of Haemon, and Polyphontes, son of Autophonus\u2014at their head, to lie in wait for him on his return journey;\nbut Tydeus slew every man of them, save only Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven\u2019s omens. Such was\nTydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but he cannot fight as his father did.\u201d\nDiomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of Agamemnon; but the son of Capaneus took up\nhis words and said, \u201cSon of Atreus, tell no lies, for you can speak truth if you will. We boast ourselves as even better\nmen than our fathers; we took seven-gated Thebes, though the wall was stronger and our men were fewer in num-\nber, for we trusted in the omens of the gods and in the help of Jove, whereas they perished through their own sheer\nfolly; hold not, then, our fathers in like honour with us.\u201d\nDiomed looked sternly at him and said, \u201cHold your peace, my friend, as I bid you. It is not amiss that Agam-\nemnon should urge the Achaeans forward, for the glory will be his if we take the city, and his the shame if we are\nvanquished. Therefore let us acquit ourselves with valour.\u201d\nAs he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so fiercely about his body that even a brave man\nmight well have been scared to hear it.\n121 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAs when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west wind has lashed it into fury\u2014it has\nreared its head afar and now comes crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high over the jagged rocks\nand spews its salt foam in all directions\u2014even so did the serried phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastly to bat-\ntle. The chiefs gave orders each to his own people, but the men said never a word; no man would think it, for huge\nas the host was, it seemed as though there was not a tongue among them, so silent were they in their obedience; and\nas they marched the armour about their bodies glistened in the sun. But the clamour of the Trojan ranks was as that\nof many thousand ewes that stand waiting to be milked in the yards of some rich flockmaster, and bleat incessantly\nin answer to the bleating of their lambs; for they had not one speech nor language, but their tongues were diverse,\nand they came from many different places. These were inspired of Mars, but the others by Minerva\u2014and with them\ncame Panic, Rout, and Strife whose fury never tires, sister and friend of murderous Mars, who, from being at first\nbut low in stature, grows till she uprears her head to heaven, though her feet are still on earth. She it was that went\nabout among them and flung down discord to the waxing of sorrow with even hand between them.\nWhen they were got together in one place shield clashed with shield and spear with spear in the rage of battle.\nThe bossed shields beat one upon another, and there was a tramp as of a great multitude\u2014death-cry and shout of\ntriumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with blood. As torrents swollen with rain course madly down\ntheir deep channels till the angry floods meet in some gorge, and the shepherd the hillside hears their roaring from\nafar\u2014even such was the toil and uproar of the hosts as they joined in battle.\nFirst Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus, son of Thalysius, fighting in the foremost\nranks. He struck at the projecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; the point of bronze pierced\nthe bone, and darkness veiled his eyes; headlong as a tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as he dropped\nKing Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and captain of the proud Abantes began dragging him out of reach of the darts\nthat were falling around him, in haste to strip him of his armour. But his purpose was not for long; Agenor saw him\nhaling the body away, and smote him in the side with his bronze-shod spear \u2014 for as he stooped his side was left\nunprotected by his shield\u2014and thus he perished. Then the fight between Trojans and Achaeans grew furious over\nhis body, and they flew upon each other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the other.\nForthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion, whom his mother bore by\nthe banks of the Simois, as she was coming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been with her parents to see their\nflocks. Therefore he was named Simoeisius, but he did not live to pay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut off\nuntimely by the spear of mighty Ajax, who struck him in the breast by the right nipple as he was coming on among\nthe foremost fighters; the spear went right through his shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has grown straight and\ntall in a meadow by some mere, and its top is thick with branches. Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its roots that\nhe may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and it lies seasoning by the waterside. In such wise did\nAjax fell to earth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion. Thereon Antiphus of the gleaming corslet, son of Priam, hurled a\nspear at Ajax from amid the crowd and missed him, but he hit Leucus, the brave comrade of Ulysses, in the groin,\nas he was dragging the body of Simoeisius over to the other side; so he fell upon the body and loosed his hold upon\nit. Ulysses was furious when he saw Leucus slain, and strode in full armour through the front ranks till he was quite\nclose; then he glared round about him and took aim, and the Trojans fell back as he did so. His dart was not sped in\nvain, for it struck Democoon, the bastard son of Priam, who had come to him from Abydos, where he had charge\nof his father\u2019s mares. Ulysses, infuriated by the death of his comrade, hit him with his spear on one temple, and the\nbronze point came through on the other side of his forehead. Thereon darkness veiled his eyes, and his armour rang\nrattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Hector, and they that were in front, then gave round while the\nArgives raised a shout and drew off the dead, pressing further forward as they did so. But Apollo looked down from\nPergamus and called aloud to the Trojans, for he was displeased. \u201cTrojans,\u201d he cried, \u201crush on the foe, and do not\nlet yourselves be thus beaten by the Argives. Their skins are not stone nor iron that when hit them you do them no\nharm. Moreover, Achilles, the son of lovely Thetis, is not fighting, but is nursing his anger at the ships.\u201d\nThus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while Jove\u2019s redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born,\nwent about among the host of the Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld them slackening.\nThen fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struck by a jagged stone near the ancle of his right\nleg. He that hurled it was Peirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who had come from Aenus; the bones\nand both the tendons were crushed by the pitiless stone. He fell to the ground on his back, and in his death throes\nstretched out his hands towards his comrades. But Peirous, who had wounded him, sprang on him and thrust a\nspear into his belly, so that his bowels came gushing out upon the ground, and darkness veiled his eyes. As he was\nleaving the body, Thoas of Aetolia struck him in the chest near the nipple, and the point fixed itself in his lungs.\nThoas came close up to him, pulled the spear out of his chest, and then drawing his sword, smote him in the middle\nof the belly so that he died; but he did not strip him of his armour, for his Thracian comrades, men who wear their\nhair in a tuft at the top of their heads, stood round the body and kept him off with their long spears for all his great\n122 The Iliad\nstature and valour; so he was driven back. Thus the two corpses lay stretched on earth near to one another, the one\ncaptain of the Thracians and the other of the Epeans; and many another fell round them.\nAnd now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could have gone about among it scatheless and\nunwounded, with Minerva leading him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears and arrows. For\nmany Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretched side by side face downwards upon the earth.\nBook V\nThen Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of Tydeus, that he might excel all the other\nArgives, and cover himself with glory. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet like the star that\nshines most brilliantly in summer after its bath in the waters of Oceanus\u2014even such a fire did she kindle upon his\nhead and shoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly of the fight.\nNow there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans, priest of Vulcan, and his name was\nDares. He had two sons, Phegeus and Idaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two came forward\nfrom the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he being on foot, while they fought from their chariot. When\nthey were close up to one another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over Diomed\u2019s left shoulder without\nhitting him. Diomed then threw, and his spear sped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple,\nand he fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride his brother\u2019s body, but sprang from the chariot and\ntook to flight, or he would have shared his brother\u2019s fate; whereon Vulcan saved him by wrapping him in a cloud of\ndarkness, that his old father might not be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the son of Tydeus drove off with the\nhorses, and bade his followers take them to the ships. The Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of Dares,\none of them in fright and the other lying dead by his chariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by the hand and said,\n\u201cMars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of cities, may we not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight\nit out, and see to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let us go away, and thus avoid his anger.\u201d\nSo saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon the steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this\nthe Danaans drove the Trojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First King Agamemnon flung\nmighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his chariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his\nback, just as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the shoulders and went right through his chest, and his\narmour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\nThen Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had come from Varne. Mighty Idomeneus\nspeared him on the right shoulder as he was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded him as he\nfell heavily from the car.\nThe squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while Menelaus, son of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the\nson of Strophius, a mighty huntsman and keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had taught him how to kill every\nkind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but neither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save\nhim, for the spear of Menelaus struck him in the back as he was flying; it struck him between the shoulders and\nwent right through his chest, so that he fell headlong and his armour rang rattling round him.\nMeriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son of Hermon, a man whose hand was skilled\nin all manner of cunning workmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that made the ships for\nAlexandrus, which were the beginning of all mischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexan-\ndrus himself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him as he was flying, and struck him on\nthe right buttock. The point of the spear went through the bone into the bladder, and death came upon him as he\ncried aloud and fell forward on his knees.\nMeges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was a bastard, had been brought up by Theano\nas one of her own children, for the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up to him and drove a\nspear into the nape of his neck: it went under his tongue all among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell dead\nin the dust.\nAnd Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble Dolopion, who had been made priest of the\nriver Scamander, and was honoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him chase as he\nwas flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody\nhand fell to the ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can withstand, came over his eyes.\nThus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of Tydeus, you could not say whether he was\nmore among the Achaeans or the Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that has burst its barrier\nin full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful vineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven, but in\na moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste that many a strong man hand has reclaimed \u2014 even\nso were the dense phalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and many though they were, they\ndared not abide his onslaught.\n123 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nNow when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving the Trojans pell-mell before him, he\naimed an arrow and hit the front part of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through the metal\nand pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with blood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph,\n\u201cKnights Trojans, come on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and he will not hold out much longer if King\nApollo was indeed with me when I sped from Lycia hither.\u201d\nThus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew and made for the chariot and horses\nof Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus. \u201cDear son of Capaneus,\u201d said he, \u201ccome down from your chariot, and draw the\narrow out of my shoulder.\u201d\nSthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the wound, whereon the blood came spouting out\nthrough the hole that had been made in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, \u201cHear me, daughter of aegis-bearing\nJove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well and stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me;\ngrant me to come within a spear\u2019s throw of that man and kill him. He has been too quick for me and has wounded\nme; and now he is boasting that I shall not see the light of the sun much longer.\u201d\nThus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs supple and quickened his hands and his\nfeet. Then she went up close to him and said, \u201cFear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for I have set in your\nheart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus. Moreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know\ngods and men apart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers you battle, do not fight him; but should Jove\u2019s\ndaughter Venus come, strike her with your spear and wound her.\u201d\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus again took his place among the foremost\nfighters, three times more fierce even than he had been before. He was like a lion that some mountain shepherd\nhas wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the wall of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has\nroused the brute to fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes shelter under cover of the buildings, while the\nsheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are smothered in heaps one on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps\nout over the sheep-yard wall. Even thus did Diomed go furiously about among the Trojans.\nHe killed Astynous, and shepherd of his people, the one with a thrust of his spear, which struck him above the\nnipple, the other with a sword\u2014cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his neck and back. He let both\nof them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas and Polyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never came\nback for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed made an end of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus\nand Thoon, the two sons of Phaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with age, and begat no\nmore sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomed took both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he\nnevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen divided his wealth among themselves.\nThen he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as they were both in one chariot. He sprang\nupon them as a lion fastens on the neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice. For all their\nvain struggles he flung them both from their chariot and stripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gave their\nhorses to his comrades to take them back to the ships.\nWhen Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went through the fight amid the rain of spears\nto see if he could find Pandarus. When he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said, \u201cPandarus, where is now your\nbow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer, in respect of which no man here can rival you nor is there\nany in Lycia that can beat you? Lift then your hands to Jove and send an arrow at this fellow who is going so mas-\nterfully about, and has done such deadly work among the Trojans. He has killed many a brave man\u2014unless indeed\nhe is some god who is angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices, and and has set his hand against them in his\ndispleasure.\u201d\nAnd the son of Lycaon answered, \u201cAeneas, I take him for none other than the son of Tydeus. I know him by his\nshield, the visor of his helmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if he is the man I say he is,\nhe is not making all this havoc without heaven\u2019s help, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud of\ndarkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have taken aim at him already and hit him on the\nright shoulder; my arrow went through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure I should send him hurrying\nto the world below, but it seems that I have not killed him. There must be a god who is angry with me. Moreover I\nhave neither horse nor chariot. In my father\u2019s stables there are eleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite\nnew, with cloths spread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses, champing barley and rye; my\nold father Lycaon urged me again and again when I was at home and on the point of starting, to take chariots and\nhorses with me that I might lead the Trojans in battle, but I would not listen to him; it would have been much better\nif I had done so, but I was thinking about the horses, which had been used to eat their fill, and I was afraid that in\nsuch a great gathering of men they might be ill-fed, so I left them at home and came on foot to Ilius armed only\nwith my bow and arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have already hit two chieftains, the sons of Atreus and\nof Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough, I have only made them still more furious. I did ill to take my\nbow down from its peg on the day I led my band of Trojans to Ilius in Hector\u2019s service, and if ever I get home again\n124 The Iliad\nto set eyes on my native place, my wife, and the greatness of my house, may some one cut my head off then and\nthere if I do not break the bow and set it on a hot fire\u2014such pranks as it plays me.\u201d\nAeneas answered, \u201cSay no more. Things will not mend till we two go against this man with chariot and horses\nand bring him to a trial of arms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros can speed hither and\nthither over the plain in pursuit or flight. If Jove again vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us safely\nback to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins while I stand upon the car to fight, or else do you wait this\nman\u2019s onset while I look after the horses.\u201d\n\u201cAeneas.\u201d replied the son of Lycaon, \u201ctake the reins and drive; if we have to fly before the son of Tydeus the\nhorses will go better for their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they expect it they may be\nfrightened, and refuse to take us out of the fight. The son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses.\nTherefore drive them yourself and I will be ready for him with my spear.\u201d\nThey then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son of Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus,\nsaw them coming and said to Diomed, \u201cDiomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two heroes speeding\ntowards you, both of them men of might the one a skilful archer, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose\nsire is Anchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let us retreat. Do not, I pray you, press so furi-\nously forward, or you may get killed.\u201d\nDiomed looked angrily at him and answered: \u201cTalk not of flight, for I shall not listen to you: I am of a race that\nknows neither flight nor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to mount, but will go against\nthem even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me be afraid of no man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds\nshall not take both back again. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart\u2014if Minerva sees fit to vouchsafe me\nthe glory of killing both, stay your horses here and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be sure you\nspring Aeneas\u2019 horses and drive them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. They are of the stock that great Jove\ngave to Tros in payment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live and move under the sun. King Anchises\nstole the blood by putting his mares to them without Laomedon\u2019s knowledge, and they bore him six foals. Four are\nstill in his stables, but he gave the other two to Aeneas. We shall win great glory if we can take them.\u201d\nThus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up to them, and the son of Lycaon spoke first.\n\u201cGreat and mighty son,\u201d said he, \u201cof noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will now try with my spear.\u201d\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck the shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze\npoint pierced it and passed on till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon shouted out and said, \u201cYou\nare hit clean through the belly; you will not stand out for long, and the glory of the fight is mine.\u201d\nBut Diomed all undismayed made answer, \u201cYou have missed, not hit, and before you two see the end of this\nmatter one or other of you shall glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood.\u201d\nWith this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to Pandarus\u2019s nose near the eye. It went crashing in\namong his white teeth; the bronze point cut through the root of his to tongue, coming out under his chin, and his\nglistening armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and he\nwas reft of life and strength.\nAeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing lest the Achaeans should carry off the\nbody. He bestrode it as a lion in the pride of strength, with shield and on spear before him and a cry of battle on\nhis lips resolute to kill the first that should dare face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge\nand great that as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore it aloft with ease unaided, and with\nthis he struck Aeneas on the groin where the hip turns in the joint that is called the \u201ccup-bone.\u201d The stone crushed\nthis joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jagged edges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees, and\npropped himself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness of night fell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas,\nking of men, would have perished then and there, had not his mother, Jove\u2019s daughter Venus, who had conceived\nhim by Anchises when he was herding cattle, been quick to mark, and thrown her two white arms about the body\nof her dear son. She protected him by covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest some Danaan should\ndrive a spear into his breast and kill him.\nThus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the son of Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders\nthat Diomed had given him. He made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding the reins to the\nrim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas\u2019s horses and drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks.\nWhen he had so done he gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylus, whom he valued above all others as the\none who was most like-minded with himself, to take them on to the ships. He then remounted his own chariot,\nseized the reins, and drove with all speed in search of the son of Tydeus.\nNow the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear in hand, for he knew her to be feeble and\nnot one of those goddesses that can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster of cities, and when\nat last after a long chase he caught her up, he flew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand. The\npoint tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven for her, and pierced the skin between her wrist\n125 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nand the palm of her hand, so that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the veins of the blessed gods, came\npouring from the wound; for the gods do not eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as ours, and\nare immortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but Phoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him\nin a cloud of darkness, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him; and Diomed shouted out\nas he left her, \u201cDaughter of Jove, leave war and battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women? If\nyou meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder at the very name of war.\u201d\nThe goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as the wind, drew her from the throng, in pain\nand with her fair skin all besmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle, with his spear and his\ntwo fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon she fell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her\nhave his horses. \u201cDear brother,\u201d she cried, \u201csave me, and give me your horses to take me to Olympus where the gods\ndwell. I am badly wounded by a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with father Jove.\u201d\nThus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She mounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart,\nwhile Iris sat beside her and took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew forward nothing\nloth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where the gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed\nthem from the chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus flung herself on to the lap of her mother\nDione, who threw her arms about her and caressed her, saying, \u201cWhich of the heavenly beings has been treating\nyou in this way, as though you had been doing something wrong in the face of day?\u201d\nAnd laughter-loving Venus answered, \u201cProud Diomed, the son of Tydeus, wounded me because I was bearing\nmy dear son Aeneas, whom I love best of all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one between Trojans\nand Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to fighting with the immortals.\u201d\n\u201cBear it, my child,\u201d replied Dione, \u201cand make the best of it. We dwellers in Olympus have to put up with much\nat the hands of men, and we lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus and Ephialtes, chil-\ndren of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he lay thirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars\nwould have then perished had not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of Aloeus, told Mercury, who stole him\naway when he was already well-nigh worn out by the severity of his bondage. Juno, again, suffered when the mighty\nson of Amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with a three-barbed arrow, and nothing could assuage her\npain. So, also, did huge Hades, when this same man, the son of aegis-bearing Jove, hit him with an arrow even at\nthe gates of hell, and hurt him badly. Thereon Hades went to the house of Jove on great Olympus, angry and full of\npain; and the arrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great anguish till Paeeon healed him by spreading soothing\nherbs on the wound, for Hades was not of mortal mould. Daring, head-strong, evildoer who recked not of his sin in\nshooting the gods that dwell in Olympus. And now Minerva has egged this son of Tydeus on against yourself, fool\nthat he is for not reflecting that no man who fights with gods will live long or hear his children prattling about his\nknees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of Tydeus see that he does not have to fight with one who is\nstronger than you are. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of Adrestus, rouse her whole house from sleep,\nwailing for the loss of her wedded lord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans.\u201d\nSo saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with both hands, whereon the pain left her, and\nher hand was healed. But Minerva and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with their mocking talk,\nand Minerva was first to speak. \u201cFather Jove,\u201d said she, \u201cdo not be angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must have\nbeen persuading some one of the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of whom she is so very fond, and while\ncaressing one or other of them she must have torn her delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman\u2019s brooch.\u201d\nThe sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his side. \u201cMy child,\u201d said he, \u201cit has not been given\nyou to be a warrior. Attend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and leave all this fighting to\nMars and to Minerva.\u201d\nThus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he knew him to be in the very arms of Apol-\nlo. Not one whit did he fear the mighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of his armour. Thrice\ndid he spring forward with might and main to slay him, and thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When\nhe was coming on for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and\nsaid, \u201cTake heed, son of Tydeus, and draw off; think not to match yourself against gods, for men that walk the earth\ncannot hold their own with the immortals.\u201d\nThe son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the anger of the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out\nof the crowd and set him in sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the mighty sanctuary, Latona\nand Diana healed him and made him glorious to behold, while Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the\nlikeness of Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and Achaeans hacked at the bucklers about one\nanother\u2019s breasts, hewing each other\u2019s round shields and light hide-covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo said to\nMars, \u201cMars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities, can you not go to this man, the son of Tydeus,\nwho would now fight even with father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first went up to the Cyprian and\nwounded her in the hand near her wrist, and afterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were a god.\u201d\n126 The Iliad\nHe then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars went about among the ranks of the Tro-\njans, cheering them on, in the likeness of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. \u201cSons of Priam,\u201d said he, \u201chow long\nwill you let your people be thus slaughtered by the Achaeans? Would you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Ae-\nneas the son of Anchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour as Hector himself. Help me, then, to rescue\nour brave comrade from the stress of the fight.\u201d\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then Sarpedon rebuked Hector very sternly. \u201cHector,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cwhere is your prowess now? You used to say that though you had neither people nor allies you could hold\nthe town alone with your brothers and brothers-in-law. I see not one of them here; they cower as hounds before\na lion; it is we, your allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. I have come from afar, even from Lycia and the banks\nof the river Xanthus, where I have left my wife, my infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy; nev-\nertheless, I head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground against any who would fight me though I have nothing\nhere for the Achaeans to plunder, while you look on, without even bidding your men stand firm in defence of their\nwives. See that you fall not into the hands of your foes as men caught in the meshes of a net, and they sack your fair\ncity forthwith. Keep this before your mind night and day, and beseech the captains of your allies to hold on without\nflinching, and thus put away their reproaches from you.\u201d\nSo spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang from his chariot clad in his suit of armour,\nand went about among the host brandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and raising the terrible cry\nof battle. Then they rallied and again faced the Achaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not\ndriven back. As the breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor, when men are winnowing\u2014\nwhile yellow Ceres blows with the wind to sift the chaff from the grain, and the chaff\u2014heaps grow whiter and whit-\ner\u2014even so did the Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses\u2019 hoofs raised to the firmament of heaven, as their\ndrivers turned them back to battle, and they bore down with might upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to help the Trojans,\ncovered them in a veil of darkness, and went about everywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told\nhim that when he saw Pallas, Minerva leave the fray he was to put courage into the hearts of the Trojans\u2014for it was\nshe who was helping the Danaans. Then Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled his heart with\nvalour, whereon he took his place among his comrades, who were overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a\ngood courage; but they could not ask him how it had all happened, for they were too busy with the turmoil raised\nby Mars and by Strife, who raged insatiably in their midst.\nThe two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless of the fury and onset of the Trojans.\nThey stood as still as clouds which the son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there is no air and\nfierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds whose shrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions\u2014even so\ndid the Danaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. The son of Atreus went about among them and\nexhorted them. \u201cMy friends,\u201d said he, \u201cquit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one another\u2019s eyes\namid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour more often live than get killed, but they that fly save neither life\nnor name.\u201d\nAs he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in the front rank, the comrade of Aeneas, De-\nicoon son of Pergasus, whom the Trojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was ever quick to\nplace himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnon struck his shield and went right through it, for\nthe shield stayed it not. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly, and his armour rang rattling round\nhim as he fell heavily to the ground.\nThen Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and Orsilochus. Their father was a rich man who\nlived in the strong city of Phere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad stream flows through the\nland of the Pylians. The river begat Orsilochus, who ruled over much people and was father to Diocles, who in his\nturn begat twin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, well skilled in all the arts of war. These, when they grew up, went to\nIlius with the Argive fleet in the cause of Menelaus and Agamemnon sons of Atreus, and there they both of them\nfell. As two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths of some mountain forest to plunder homesteads and\ncarry off sheep and cattle till they get killed by the hand of man, so were these two vanquished by Aeneas, and fell\nlike high pine-trees to the ground.\nBrave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the front, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing\nhis spear, for Mars egged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by Aeneas; but Antilochus the son of\nNestor saw him and sprang forward, fearing that the king might come to harm and thus bring all their labour to noth-\ning; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were setting their hands and spears against one another eager to do battle,\nAntilochus placed himself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold though he was, drew back on seeing the two heroes\nside by side in front of him, so they drew the bodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks of the Achaeans and com-\nmitted the two poor fellows into the hands of their comrades. They then turned back and fought in the front ranks.\nThey killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian warriors. Menelaus struck him on the col-\nlar-bone as he was standing on his chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the son of\n127 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAtymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with a stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched\nwith white ivory, fell from his hands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck him on the temples\nwith his sword, whereon he fell head first from the chariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head\nand shoulders buried deep in the dust\u2014for he had fallen on sandy soil till his horses kicked him and laid him flat\non the ground, as Antilochus lashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.\nBut Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry rushed towards them, followed by the\nstrong battalions of the Trojans. Mars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil of battle, while\nMars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now in front of Hector and now behind him.\nDiomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide plain is dismayed to find himself on the\nbrink of some great river rolling swiftly to the sea\u2014he sees its boiling waters and starts back in fear\u2014even so did\nthe son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to his men, \u201cMy friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the\nspear so well? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now Mars is with him in the likeness of mortal man.\nKeep your faces therefore towards the Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not fight with gods.\u201d\nAs he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men, both in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchi-\nalus, heroes well versed in war. Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close up and hurled his spear,\nhitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man of great wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land,\nbut his lot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajax struck him in the belt; the spear pierced the\nlower part of his belly, and he fell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to strip him of his armour, but\nthe Trojans rained spears upon him, many of which fell upon his shield. He planted his heel upon the body and\ndrew out his spear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him that he could not strip the goodly armour from his\nshoulders. The Trojan chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so that he dared\nnot stay; great, brave and valiant though he was, they drove him from them and he was beaten back.\nThus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong hand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of\nHercules, a man both brave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and grandson of great Jove, drew\nnear to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke first. \u201cSarpedon,\u201d said he, \u201ccouncillor of the Lycians, why should you\ncome skulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call you son of aegis-bearing Jove, for you are little\nlike those who were of old his children. Far other was Hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted father, who came\nhere for the horses of Laomedon, and though he had six ships only, and few men to follow him, sacked the city of\nIlius and made a wilderness of her highways. You are a coward, and your people are falling from you. For all your\nstrength, and all your coming from Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will pass the gates of Hades van-\nquished by my hand.\u201d\nAnd Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, \u201cTlepolemus, your father overthrew Ilius by reason of Laome-\ndon\u2019s folly in refusing payment to one who had served him well. He would not give your father the horses which he\nhad come so far to fetch. As for yourself, you shall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory to myself, and your\nsoul to Hades of the noble steeds.\u201d\nThus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw at the same moment, and Sarpedon\nstruck his foe in the middle of his throat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell upon his eyes.\nTlepolemus\u2019s spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh with such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the\nbone, but his father as yet warded off destruction from him.\nHis comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the weight of the spear that was dragging from his\nwound. They were in such haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of drawing the spear from his thigh\nso as to let him walk uprightly. Meanwhile the Achaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon Ulysses was\nmoved to pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld them. He doubted whether to pursue the son of Jove, or to make\nslaughter of the Lycian rank and file; it was not decreed, however, that he should slay the son of Jove; Minerva, there-\nfore, turned him against the main body of the Lycians. He killed Coeranus, Alastor, Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius,\nNoemon, and Prytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not great Hector marked him, and sped to the front of the\nfight clad in his suit of mail, filling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon was glad when he saw him coming, and be-\nsought him, saying, \u201cSon of Priam, let me not he here to fall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me, and since I may\nnot return home to gladden the hearts of my wife and of my infant son, let me die within the walls of your city.\u201d\nHector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon the Achaeans and. kill many among them.\nHis comrades then bore Sarpedon away and laid him beneath Jove\u2019s spreading oak tree. Pelagon, his friend and\ncomrade drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon fainted and a mist came over his eyes. Presently he came to\nhimself again, for the breath of the north wind as it played upon him gave him new life, and brought him out of the\ndeep swoon into which he had fallen.\nMeanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by Mars and Hector, nor yet did they attack\nthem; when they knew that Mars was with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turned towards the\nfoe. Who, then, was first and who last to be slain by Mars and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes the\n128 The Iliad\nrenowned charioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son of Oenops, and Oresbius of the\ngleaming girdle, who was possessed of great wealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians who\nlived near him, owners of a fertile country.\nNow when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said to Minerva, \u201cAlas, daughter of aegis-bearing\nJove, unweariable, the promise we made Menelaus that he should not return till he had sacked the city of Ilius will\nbe of none effect if we let Mars rage thus furiously. Let us go into the fray at once.\u201d\nMinerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter of great Saturn, began to harness her\ngold-bedizened steeds. Hebe with all speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were on either side of\nthe iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were of gold, imperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze,\nwondrous to behold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning round the axle upon either side. The car itself was\nmade with plaited bands of gold and silver, and it had a double top-rail running all round it. From the body of the\ncar there went a pole of silver, on to the end of which she bound the golden yoke, with the bands of gold that were\nto go under the necks of the horses Then Juno put her steeds under the yoke, eager for battle and the war-cry.\nMeanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with her own hands, on to her father\u2019s thresh-\nold, and donned the shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis about her shoulders,\nwreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and on it were Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold;\nmoreover there was the head of the dread monster Gorgon, grim and awful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove.\nOn her head she set her helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to a peak both in front and behind\u2014decked\nwith the emblems of a hundred cities; then she stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the spear, so stout\nand sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno lashed the horses\non, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew open of their own accord\u2014gates over which the flours preside, in\nwhose hands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides them, or to close it. Through these\nthe goddesses drove their obedient steeds, and found the son of Saturn sitting all alone on the topmost ridges of\nOlympus. There Juno stayed her horses, and spoke to Jove the son of Saturn, lord of all. \u201cFather Jove,\u201d said she, \u201care\nyou not angry with Mars for these high doings? how great and goodly a host of the Achaeans he has destroyed to\nmy great grief, and without either right or reason, while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease and\nsetting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I hope, Father Jove, that you will not be angry if I hit\nMars hard, and chase him out of the battle.\u201d\nAnd Jove answered, \u201cSet Minerva on to him, for she punishes him more often than any one else does.\u201d\nJuno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew forward nothing loth midway betwixt earth and\nsky. As far as a man can see when he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can the loud-neighing\nhorses of the gods spring at a single bound. When they reached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams\nSimois and Scamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from the chariot. She hid them in a thick\ncloud, and Simois made ambrosia spring up for them to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying like turtle-\ndoves in their eagerness to help the Argives. When they came to the part where the bravest and most in number\nwere gathered about mighty Diomed, fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance, there Juno\nstood still and raised a shout like that of brazen-voiced Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together.\n\u201cArgives,\u201d she cried; \u201cshame on cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only; as long as Achilles was fighting, fi his\nspear was so deadly that the Trojans dared not show themselves outside the Dardanian gates, but now they sally far\nfrom the city and fight even at your ships.\u201d\nWith these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva sprang to the side of the son of Tydeus,\nwhom she found near his chariot and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For the sweat caused\nby the hand that bore the weight of his shield irritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up\nthe strap to wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the yoke of his horses and said, \u201cThe son of Tydeus\nis not such another as his father. Tydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly into the fray even\nwhen I told him not to do so. When he went all unattended as envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans,\nI bade him feast in their houses and be at peace; but with that high spirit which was ever present with him, he\nchallenged the youth of the Cadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so mightily did I help him. I\nstand by you too to protect you, and I bid you be instant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are tired out, or you\nare afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say that you are no true son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus.\u201d\nDiomed answered, \u201cI know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, and will hide nothing from you. I am\nnot afraid nor out of heart, nor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your own instructions; you told me\nnot to fight any of the blessed gods; but if Jove\u2019s daughter Venus came into battle I was to wound her with my spear.\nTherefore I am retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather in this place, for I know that Mars is now lording it\nin the field.\u201d\n\u201cDiomed, son of Tydeus,\u201d replied Minerva, \u201cman after my own heart, fear neither Mars nor any other of the\nimmortals, for I will befriend you. Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close combat; fear not this raging\n129 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nmadman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then on the other. But now he was holding talk with Juno and my-\nself, saying he would help the Argives and attack the Trojans; nevertheless he is with the Trojans, and has forgotten\nthe Argives.\u201d\nWith this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the chariot on to the ground. In a second he was on\nthe ground, whereupon the goddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side of Diomed. The oaken axle\ngroaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess and the hero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins, and\ndrove straight at Mars. He was in the act of stripping huge Periphas, son of Ochesius and bravest of the Aetolians.\nBloody Mars was stripping him of his armour, and Minerva donned the helmet of Hades, that he might not see her;\nwhen, therefore, he saw Diomed, he made straight for him and let Periphas lie where he had fallen. As soon as they\nwere at close quarters he let fly with his bronze spear over the reins and yoke, thinking to take Diomed\u2019s life, but\nMinerva caught the spear in her hand and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed then threw, and Pallas\nMinerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars\u2019s stomach where his under-girdle went round him. There Diomed\nwounded him, tearing his fair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars roared as loudly as nine or ten\nthousand men in the thick of a fight, and the Achaeans and Trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry\nhe raised.\nAs a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, even so did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars\nascend into the broad heavens. With all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great pain sat\ndown beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the immortal blood that was flowing from his wound, and\nspoke piteously, saying, \u201cFather Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods are continually suffering in the\nmost cruel manner at one another\u2019s hands while helping mortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten\nthat mad termagant of a daughter, who is always committing outrage of some kind. We other gods must all do as\nyou bid us, but her you neither scold nor punish; you encourage her because the pestilent creature is your daughter.\nSee how she has been inciting proud Diomed to vent his rage on the immortal gods. First he went up to the Cyprian\nand wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then he sprang upon me too as though he were a god. Had I not\nrun for it I must either have lain there for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpes, or have been eaten\nalive with spears till I had no more strength left in me.\u201d\nJove looked angrily at him and said, \u201cDo not come whining here, Sir Facing-bothways. I hate you worst of all\nthe gods in Olympus, for you are ever fighting and making mischief. You have the intolerable and stubborn spirit of\nyour mother Juno: it is all I can do to manage her, and it is her doing that you are now in this plight: still, I cannot\nlet you remain longer in such great pain; you are my own off-spring, and it was by me that your mother conceived\nyou; if, however, you had been the son of any other god, you are so destructive that by this time you should have\nbeen lying lower than the Titans.\u201d\nHe then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing herbs upon his wound and cured him, for\nhe was not of mortal mould. As the juice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment though it is liq-\nuid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars. Then Hebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and\nhe took his seat by his father Jove all glorious to behold.\nBut Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put a stop to the murderous doings of Mars,\nwent back again to the house of Jove.\nBook VI\nTHE fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as it would, and the tide of war surged hither\nand thither over the plain as they aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another between the streams of Simois and\nXanthus.\nFirst, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, broke a phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the\nassistance of his comrades by killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among the Thracians, being both brave\nand of great stature. The spear struck the projecting peak of his helmet: its bronze point then went through his fore-\nhead into the brain, and darkness veiled his eyes.\nThen Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived in the strong city of Arisbe, and was\nbeloved by all men; for he had a house by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeit not one of\nhis guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomed killed both him and his squire Calesius, who was then his\ncharioteer\u2014so the pair passed beneath the earth.\nEuryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit of Aesepus and Pedasus, whom the naiad\nnymph Abarbarea had borne to noble Bucolion. Bucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a bastard. While\ntending his sheep he had converse with the nymph, and she conceived twin sons; these the son of Mecisteus now\nslew, and he stripped the armour from their shoulders. Polypoetes then killed Astyalus, Ulysses Pidytes of Percote,\nand Teucer Aretaon. Ablerus fell by the spear of Nestor\u2019s son Antilochus, and Agamemnon, king of men, killed Ela-\n130 The Iliad\ntus who dwelt in Pedasus by the banks of the river Satnioeis. Leitus killed Phylacus as he was flying, and Eurypylus\nslew Melanthus.\nThen Menelaus of the loud war-cry took Adrestus alive, for his horses ran into a tamarisk bush, as they were\nflying wildly over the plain, and broke the pole from the car; they went on towards the city along with the others\nin full flight, but Adrestus rolled out, and fell in the dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot; Menelaus came\nup to him spear in hand, but Adrestus caught him by the knees begging for his life. \u201cTake me alive,\u201d he cried, \u201cson\nof Atreus, and you shall have a full ransom for me: my father is rich and has much treasure of gold, bronze, and\nwrought iron laid by in his house. From this store he will give you a large ransom should he hear of my being alive\nand at the ships of the Achaeans.\u201d\nThus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him to a squire to take to the ships of the Achae-\nans, but Agamemnon came running up to him and rebuked him. \u201cMy good Menelaus,\u201d said he, \u201cthis is no time\nfor giving quarter. Has, then, your house fared so well at the hands of the Trojans? Let us not spare a single one of\nthem\u2014not even the child unborn and in its mother\u2019s womb; let not a man of them be left alive, but let all in Ilius\nperish, unheeded and forgotten.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his words were just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust\nAdrestus from him, whereon King Agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: then the son of Atreus planted\nhis foot upon his breast to draw his spear from the body.\nMeanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, \u201cMy friends, Danaan warriors, servants of Mars, let no man\nlag that he may spoil the dead, and bring back much booty to the ships. Let us kill as many as we can; the bodies\nwill lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them later at your leisure.\u201d\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. And now the Trojans would have been routed and driven\nback into Ilius, had not Priam\u2019s son Helenus, wisest of augurs, said to Hector and Aeneas, \u201cHector and Aeneas, you\ntwo are the mainstays of the Trojans and Lycians, for you are foremost at all times, alike in fight and counsel; hold\nyour ground here, and go about among the host to rally them in front of the gates, or they will fling themselves into\nthe arms of their wives, to the great joy of our foes. Then, when you have put heart into all our companies, we will\nstand firm here and fight the Danaans however hard they press us, for there is nothing else to be done. Meanwhile\ndo you, Hector, go to the city and tell our mother what is happening. Tell her to bid the matrons gather at the tem-\nple of Minerva in the acropolis; let her then take her key and open the doors of the sacred building; there, upon the\nknees of Minerva, let her lay the largest, fairest robe she has in her house\u2014the one she sets most store by; let her,\nmoreover, promise to sacrifice twelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple of the goddess,\nif she will take pity on the town, with the wives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from fall-\ning on the goodly city of Ilius; for he fights with fury and fills men\u2019s souls with panic. I hold him mightiest of them\nall; we did not fear even their great champion Achilles, son of a goddess though he be, as we do this man: his rage is\nbeyond all bounds, and there is none can vie with him in prowess\u201d\nHector did as his brother bade him. He sprang from his chariot, and went about everywhere among the host,\nbrandishing his spears, urging the men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle. Thereon they rallied and\nagain faced the Achaeans, who gave ground and ceased their murderous onset, for they deemed that some one of\nthe immortals had come down from starry heaven to help the Trojans, so strangely had they rallied. And Hector\nshouted to the Trojans, \u201cTrojans and allies, be men, my friends, and fight with might and main, while I go to Ilius\nand tell the old men of our council and our wives to pray to the gods and vow hecatombs in their honour.\u201d\nWith this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went round his shield beat against his neck and his\nankles.\nThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus went into the open space between the hosts to fight in\nsingle combat. When they were close up to one another Diomed of the loud war-cry was the first to speak. \u201cWho,\nmy good sir,\u201d said he, \u201cwho are you among men? I have never seen you in battle until now, but you are daring be-\nyond all others if you abide my onset. Woe to those fathers whose sons face my might. If, however, you are one of\nthe immortals and have come down from heaven, I will not fight you; for even valiant Lycurgus, son of Dryas, did\nnot live long when he took to fighting with the gods. He it was that drove the nursing women who were in charge\nof frenzied Bacchus through the land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsi on the ground as murderous Lycurgus\nbeat them with his oxgoad. Bacchus himself plunged terror-stricken into the sea, and Thetis took him to her bosom\nto comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which the man reviled him. Thereon the gods who live at ease\nwere angry with Lycurgus and the son of Saturn struck him blind, nor did he live much longer after he had become\nhateful to the immortals. Therefore I will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are of them that eat the fruit of\nthe ground, draw near and meet your doom.\u201d\nAnd the son of Hippolochus answered, son of Tydeus, why ask me of my lineage? Men come and go as leaves\nyear by year upon the trees. Those of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when spring returns the forest\nbuds forth with fresh vines. Even so is it with the generations of mankind, the new spring up as the old are passing\n131 Compact Anthology of World Literature\naway. If, then, you would learn my descent, it is one that is well known to many. There is a city in the heart of Argos,\npasture land of horses, called Ephyra, where Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiest of all mankind. He was the son of\nAeolus, and had a son named Glaucus, who was father to Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most surpass-\ning comeliness and beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, and being stronger than he, drove him from the land of the\nArgives, over which Jove had made him ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted after him, and would have had him lie\nwith her in secret; but Bellerophon was an honourable man and would not, so she told lies about him to Proteus. \u2018Pro-\netus,\u2019 said she, \u2018kill Bellerophon or die, for he would have had converse with me against my will.\u2019 The king was angered,\nbut shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent him to Lycia with lying letters of introduction, written on a folded\ntablet, and containing much ill against the bearer. He bade Bellerophon show these letters to his father-in-law, to the\nend that he might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to Lycia, and the gods convoyed him safely.\n\u201cWhen he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the king received him with all goodwill, feasted him\nnine days, and killed nine heifers in his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning appeared upon the tenth day, he\nquestioned him and desired to see the letter from his son-in-law Proetus. When he had received the wicked letter\nhe first commanded Bellerophon to kill that savage monster, the Chimaera, who was not a human being, but a\ngoddess, for she had the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent, while her body was that of a goat, and she breathed\nforth flames of fire; but Bellerophon slew her, for he was guided by signs from heaven. He next fought the far-famed\nSolymi, and this, he said, was the hardest of all his battles. Thirdly, he killed the Amazons, women who were the\npeers of men, and as he was returning thence the king devised yet another plan for his destruction; he picked the\nbravest warriors in all Lycia, and placed them in ambuscade, but not a man ever came back, for Bellerophon killed\nevery one of them. Then the king knew that he must be the valiant offspring of a god, so he kept him in Lycia, gave\nhim his daughter in marriage, and made him of equal honour in the kingdom with himself; and the Lycians gave\nhim a piece of land, the best in all the country, fair with vineyards and tilled fields, to have and to hold.\n\u201cThe king\u2019s daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander, Hippolochus, and Laodameia. Jove, the lord\nof counsel, lay with Laodameia, and she bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophon came to be hated by all\nthe gods, he wandered all desolate and dismayed upon the Alean plain, gnawing at his own heart, and shunning\nthe path of man. Mars, insatiate of battle, killed his son Isander while he was fighting the Solymi; his daughter was\nkilled by Diana of the golden reins, for she was angered with her; but Hippolochus was father to myself, and when\nhe sent me to Troy he urged me again and again to fight ever among the foremost and outvie my peers, so as not to\nshame the blood of my fathers who were the noblest in Ephyra and in all Lycia. This, then, is the descent I claim.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad. He planted his spear in the ground, and spoke to him\nwith friendly words. \u201cThen,\u201d he said, you are an old friend of my father\u2019s house. Great Oeneus once entertained Bel-\nlerophon for twenty days, and the two exchanged presents. Oeneus gave a belt rich with purple, and Bellerophon a\ndouble cup, which I left at home when I set out for Troy. I do not remember Tydeus, for he was taken from us while\nI was yet a child, when the army of the Achaeans was cut to pieces before Thebes. Henceforth, however, I must be\nyour host in middle Argos, and you mine in Lycia, if I should ever go there; let us avoid one another\u2019s spears even\nduring a general engagement; there are many noble Trojans and allies whom I can kill, if I overtake them and heav-\nen delivers them into my hand; so again with yourself, there are many Achaeans whose lives you may take if you\ncan; we two, then, will exchange armour, that all present may know of the old ties that subsist between us.\u201d\nWith these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped one another\u2019s hands, and plighted friendship. But\nthe son of Saturn made Glaucus take leave of his wits, for he exchanged golden armour for bronze, the worth of a\nhundred head of cattle for the worth of nine.\nNow when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the wives and daughters of the Trojans came run-\nning towards him to ask after their sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told them to set about praying to the\ngods, and many were made sorrowful as they heard him.\nPresently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned with colonnades of hewn stone. In it there\nwere fifty bedchambers\u2014all of hewn stone\u2014built near one another, where the sons of Priam slept, each with his\nwedded wife. Opposite these, on the other side the courtyard, there were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for\nPriam\u2019s daughters, built near one another, where his sons-in-law slept with their wives. When Hector got there, his\nfond mother came up to him with Laodice the fairest of her daughters. She took his hand within her own and said,\n\u201cMy son, why have you left the battle to come hither? Are the Achaeans, woe betide them, pressing you hard about\nthe city that you have thought fit to come and uplift your hands to Jove from the citadel? Wait till I can bring you\nwine that you may make offering to Jove and to the other immortals, and may then drink and be refreshed. Wine\ngives a man fresh strength when he is wearied, as you now are with fighting on behalf of your kinsmen.\u201d\nAnd Hector answered, \u201cHonoured mother, bring no wine, lest you unman me and I forget my strength. I dare\nnot make a drink-offering to Jove with unwashed hands; one who is bespattered with blood and filth may not pray\nto the son of Saturn. Get the matrons together, and go with offerings to the temple of Minerva driver of the spoil;\nthere, upon the knees of Minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you have in your house \u2014 the one you set most\n132 The Iliad\nstore by; promise, moreover, to sacrifice twelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple of the\ngoddess if she will take pity on the town, with the wives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus\nfrom off the goodly city of Ilius, for he fights with fury, and fills men\u2019s souls with panic. Go, then, to the temple of\nMinerva, while I seek Paris and exhort him, if he will hear my words. Would that the earth might open her jaws and\nswallow him, for Jove bred him to be the bane of the Trojans, and of Priam and Priam\u2019s sons. Could I but see him go\ndown into the house of Hades, my heart would forget its heaviness.\u201d\nHis mother went into the house and called her waiting-women who gathered the matrons throughout the city.\nShe then went down into her fragrant store-room, where her embroidered robes were kept, the work of Sidonian\nwomen, whom Alexandrus had brought over from Sidon when he sailed the seas upon that voyage during which he\ncarried off Helen. Hecuba took out the largest robe, and the one that was most beautifully enriched with embroi-\ndery, as an offering to Minerva: it glittered like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. With this she went on\nher way and many matrons with her.\nWhen they reached the temple of Minerva, lovely Theano, daughter of Cisseus and wife of Antenor, opened the\ndoors, for the Trojans had made her priestess of Minerva. The women lifted up their hands to the goddess with a\nloud cry, and Theano took the robe to lay it upon the knees of Minerva, praying the while to the daughter of great\nJove. \u201cHoly Minerva,\u201d she cried, \u201cprotectress of our city, mighty goddess, break the spear of Diomed and lay him\nlow before the Scaean gates. Do this, and we will sacrifice twelve heifers that have never yet known the goad, in\nyour temple, if you will have pity upon the town, with the wives and little ones If the Trojans.\u201d Thus she prayed, but\nPallas Minerva granted not her prayer.\nWhile they were thus praying to the daughter of great Jove, Hector went to the fair house of Alexandrus, which\nhe had built for him by the foremost builders in the land. They had built him his house, storehouse, and courtyard\nnear those of Priam and Hector on the acropolis. Here Hector entered, with a spear eleven cubits long in his hand;\nthe bronze point gleamed in front of him, and was fastened to the shaft of the spear by a ring of gold. He found\nAlexandrus within the house, busied about his armour, his shield and cuirass, and handling his curved bow; there,\ntoo, sat Argive Helen with her women, setting them their several tasks; and as Hector saw him he rebuked him with\nwords of scorn. \u201cSir,\u201d said he, \u201cyou do ill to nurse this rancour; the people perish fighting round this our town; you\nwould yourself chide one whom you saw shirking his part in the combat. Up then, or ere long the city will be in a\nblaze.\u201d\nAnd Alexandrus answered, \u201cHector, your rebuke is just; listen therefore, and believe me when I tell you that I\nam not here so much through rancour or ill-will towards the Trojans, as from a desire to indulge my grief. My wife\nwas even now gently urging me to battle, and I hold it better that I should go, for victory is ever fickle. Wait, then,\nwhile I put on my armour, or go first and I will follow. I shall be sure to overtake you.\u201d\nHector made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. \u201cBrother,\u201d said she, \u201cto my abhorred and sinful self,\nwould that a whirlwind had caught me up on the day my mother brought me forth, and had borne me to some\nmountain or to the waves of the roaring sea that should have swept me away ere this mischief had come about. But,\nsince the gods have devised these evils, would, at any rate, that I had been wife to a better man\u2014to one who could\nsmart under dishonour and men\u2019s evil speeches. This fellow was never yet to be depended upon, nor never will be,\nand he will surely reap what he has sown. Still, brother, come in and rest upon this seat, for it is you who bear the\nbrunt of that toil that has been caused by my hateful self and by the sin of Alexandrus\u2014both of whom Jove has\ndoomed to be a theme of song among those that shall be born hereafter.\u201d\nAnd Hector answered, \u201cBid me not be seated, Helen, for all the goodwill you bear me. I cannot stay. I am in\nhaste to help the Trojans, who miss me greatly when I am not among them; but urge your husband, and of his own\nself also let him make haste to overtake me before I am out of the city. I must go home to see my household, my\nwife and my little son, for I know not whether I shall ever again return to them, or whether the gods will cause me\nto fill by the hands of the Achaeans.\u201d\nThen Hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. He did not find Andromache, for she was on the wall\nwith her child and one of her maids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was not within, he stood on the thresh-\nold of the women\u2019s rooms and said, \u201cWomen, tell me, and tell me true, where did Andromache go when she left the\nhouse? Was it to my sisters, or to my brothers\u2019 wives? or is she at the temple of Minerva where the other women are\npropitiating the awful goddess?\u201d\nHis good housekeeper answered, \u201cHector, since you bid me tell you truly, she did not go to your sisters nor to\nyour brothers\u2019 wives, nor yet to the temple of Minerva, where the other women are propitiating the awful goddess,\nbut she is on the high wall of Ilius, for she had heard the Trojans were being hard pressed, and that the Achaeans\nwere in great force: she went to the wall in frenzied haste, and the nurse went with her carrying the child.\u201d\nHector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and went down the streets by the same way that\nhe had come. When he had gone through the city and had reached the Scaean gates through which he would go\nout on to the plain, his wife came running towards him, Andromache, daughter of great Eetion who ruled in Thebe\n133 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nunder the wooded slopes of Mt. Placus, and was king of the Cilicians. His daughter had married Hector, and now\ncame to meet him with a nurse who carried his little child in her bosom\u2014a mere babe. Hector\u2019s darling son, and\nlovely as a star. Hector had named him Scamandrius, but the people called him Astyanax, for his father stood alone\nas chief guardian of Ilius. Hector smiled as he looked upon the boy, but he did not speak, and Andromache stood by\nhim weeping and taking his hand in her own. \u201cDear husband,\u201d said she, \u201cyour valour will bring you to destruction;\nthink on your infant son, and on my hapless self who ere long shall be your widow\u2014for the Achaeans will set upon\nyou in a body and kill you. It would be better for me, should I lose you, to lie dead and buried, for I shall have noth-\ning left to comfort me when you are gone, save only sorrow. I have neither father nor mother now. Achilles slew my\nfather when he sacked Thebe the goodly city of the Cilicians. He slew him, but did not for very shame despoil him;\nwhen he had burned him in his wondrous armour, he raised a barrow over his ashes and the mountain nymphs,\ndaughters of aegis-bearing Jove, planted a grove of elms about his tomb. I had seven brothers in my father\u2019s house,\nbut on the same day they all went within the house of Hades. Achilles killed them as they were with their sheep and\ncattle. My mother\u2014her who had been queen of all the land under Mt. Placus\u2014he brought hither with the spoil, and\nfreed her for a great sum, but the archer \u2014 queen Diana took her in the house of your father. Nay\u2014Hector\u2014you\nwho to me are father, mother, brother, and dear husband\u2014have mercy upon me; stay here upon this wall; make not\nyour child fatherless, and your wife a widow; as for the host, place them near the fig-tree, where the city can be best\nscaled, and the wall is weakest. Thrice have the bravest of them come thither and assailed it, under the two Ajaxes,\nIdomeneus, the sons of Atreus, and the brave son of Tydeus, either of their own bidding, or because some soothsay-\ner had told them.\u201d\nAnd Hector answered, \u201cWife, I too have thought upon all this, but with what face should I look upon the\nTrojans, men or women, if I shirked battle like a coward? I cannot do so: I know nothing save to fight bravely in the\nforefront of the Trojan host and win renown alike for my father and myself. Well do I know that the day will surely\ncome when mighty Ilius shall be destroyed with Priam and Priam\u2019s people, but I grieve for none of these\u2014not even\nfor Hecuba, nor King Priam, nor for my brothers many and brave who may fall in the dust before their foes\u2014for\nnone of these do I grieve as for yourself when the day shall come on which some one of the Achaeans shall rob\nyou for ever of your freedom, and bear you weeping away. It may be that you will have to ply the loom in Argos at\nthe bidding of a mistress, or to fetch water from the springs Messeis or Hypereia, treated brutally by some cruel\ntask-master; then will one say who sees you weeping, \u2018She was wife to Hector, the bravest warrior among the Tro-\njans during the war before Ilius.\u2019 On this your tears will break forth anew for him who would have put away the day\nof captivity from you. May I lie dead under the barrow that is heaped over my body ere I hear your cry as they carry\nyou into bondage.\u201d\nHe stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried and nestled in his nurse\u2019s bosom, scared at the sight\nof his father\u2019s armour, and at the horse-hair plume that nodded fiercely from his helmet. His father and mother\nlaughed to see him, but Hector took the helmet from his head and laid it all gleaming upon the ground. Then he\ntook his darling child, kissed him, and dandled him in his arms, praying over him the while to Jove and to all the\ngods. \u201cJove,\u201d he cried, \u201cgrant that this my child may be even as myself, chief among the Trojans; let him be not less\nexcellent in strength, and let him rule Ilius with his might. Then may one say of him as he comes from battle, \u2018The\nson is far better than the father.\u2019 May he bring back the blood-stained spoils of him whom he has laid low, and let\nhis mother\u2019s heart be glad.\u2019\u201d\nWith this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, who took him to her own soft bosom, smiling through\nher tears. As her husband watched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressed her fondly, saying, \u201cMy own\nwife, do not take these things too bitterly to heart. No one can hurry me down to Hades before my time, but if a\nman\u2019s hour is come, be he brave or be he coward, there is no escape for him when he has once been born. Go, then,\nwithin the house, and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your ser-\nvants; for war is man\u2019s matter, and mine above all others of them that have been born in Ilius.\u201d\nHe took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went back again to her house, weeping bitterly and\noften looking back towards him. When she reached her home she found her maidens within, and bade them all join\nin her lament; so they mourned Hector in his own house though he was yet alive, for they deemed that they should\nnever see him return safe from battle, and from the furious hands of the Achaeans.\nParis did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodly armour overlaid with bronze, and hasted through\nthe city as fast as his feet could take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose and gallops gloriously over the\nplain to the place where he is wont to bathe in the fair-flowing river\u2014he holds his head high, and his mane streams\nupon his shoulders as he exults in his strength and flies like the wind to the haunts and feeding ground of the\nmares\u2014even so went forth Paris from high Pergamus, gleaming like sunlight in his armour, and he laughed aloud\nas he sped swiftly on his way. Forthwith he came upon his brother Hector, who was then turning away from the\nplace where he had held converse with his wife, and he was himself the first to speak. \u201cSir,\u201d said he, \u201cI fear that I\nhave kept you waiting when you are in haste, and have not come as quickly as you bade me.\u201d\n134 The Iliad\n\u201cMy good brother,\u201d answered Hector, \u201cyou fight bravely, and no man with any justice can make light of your do-\nings in battle. But you are careless and wilfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart to hear the ill that the Trojans speak\nabout you, for they have suffered much on your account. Let us be going, and we will make things right hereafter,\nshould Jove vouchsafe us to set the cup of our deliverance before ever-living gods of heaven in our own homes,\nwhen we have chased the Achaeans from Troy.\u201d\nBook VII\nWITH these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother Alexandrus with him, both eager for the\nfray. As when heaven sends a breeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and have laboured at their oars\ntill they are faint with toil, even so welcome was the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans.\nThereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he lived in Ame, and was son of Areithous the\nMace-man, and of Phylomedusa. Hector threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead with a wound in the neck\nunder the bronze rim of his helmet. Glaucus, moreover, son of Hippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in hard hand-\nto-hand fight smote Iphinous son of Dexius on the shoulder, as he was springing on to his chariot behind his fleet\nmares; so he fell to earth from the car, and there was no life left in him.\nWhen, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of the Argives, she darted down to Ilius from the sum-\nmits of Olympus, and Apollo, who was looking on from Pergamus, went out to meet her; for he wanted the Trojans\nto be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, and King Apollo son of Jove was first to speak. \u201cWhat would you have\nsaid he, \u201cdaughter of great Jove, that your proud spirit has sent you hither from Olympus? Have you no pity upon\nthe Trojans, and would you incline the scales of victory in favour of the Danaans? Let me persuade you\u2014for it will\nbe better thus\u2014stay the combat for to-day, but let them renew the fight hereafter till they compass the doom of\nIlius, since you goddesses have made up your minds to destroy the city.\u201d\nAnd Minerva answered, \u201cSo be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mind that I came down from Olympus to the Tro-\njans and Achaeans. Tell me, then, how do you propose to end this present fighting?\u201d\nApollo, son of Jove, replied, \u201cLet us incite great Hector to challenge some one of the Danaans in single combat;\non this the Achaeans will be shamed into finding a man who will fight him.\u201d\nMinerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel of the gods; he therefore went up to Hector\nand said, \u201cHector son of Priam, peer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then persuade you. Bid the other\nTrojans and Achaeans all of them take their seats, and challenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet you in\nsingle combat. I have heard the voice of the ever-living gods, and the hour of your doom is not yet come.\u201d\nHector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the Trojans, grasping his spear by the middle to\nhold them back, and they all sat down. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated. But Minerva and Apollo, in\nthe likeness of vultures, perched on father Jove\u2019s high oak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks sat close ranged\ntogether, bristling with shield and helmet and spear. As when the rising west wind furs the face of the sea and the\nwaters grow dark beneath it, so sat the companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon the plain. And Hector spoke\nthus:\u2014\n\u201cHear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am minded; Jove on his high throne has brought\nour oaths and covenants to nothing, and foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either take the towers of Troy, or are\nyourselves vanquished at your ships. The princes of the Achaeans are here present in the midst of you; let him, then,\nthat will fight me stand forward as your champion against Hector. Thus I say, and may Jove be witness between us.\nIf your champion slay me, let him strip me of my armour and take it to your ships, but let him send my body home\nthat the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when I am dead. In like manner, if Apollo vouchsafe\nme glory and I slay your champion, I will strip him of his armour and take it to the city of Ilius, where I will hang\nit in the temple of Apollo, but I will give up his body, that the Achaeans may bury him at their ships, and the build\nhim a mound by the wide waters of the Hellespont. Then will one say hereafter as he sails his ship over the sea, \u2018This\nis the monument of one who died long since a champion who was slain by mighty Hector.\u2019 Thus will one say, and\nmy fame shall not be lost.\u201d\nThus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to decline the challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at\nlast Menelaus rose and rebuked them, for he was angry. \u201cAlas,\u201d he cried, \u201cvain braggarts, women forsooth not men,\ndouble-dyed indeed will be the stain upon us if no man of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned\nevery man of you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious in your places. I will myself go out against\nthis man, but the upshot of the fight will be from on high in the hands of the immortal gods.\u201d\nWith these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your life would have come to an end at the\nhands of hands of Hector, for he was far better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprung upon you and\nchecked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the right hand and said, \u201cMenelaus, you are mad; a truce to this\nfolly. Be patient in spite of passion, do not think of fighting a man so much stronger than yourself as Hector son of\n135 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nPriam, who is feared by many another as well as you. Even Achilles, who is far more doughty than you are, shrank\nfrom meeting him in battle. Sit down your own people, and the Achaeans will send some other champion to fight\nHector; fearless and fond of battle though he be, I ween his knees will bend gladly under him if he comes out alive\nfrom the hurly-burly of this fight.\u201d\nWith these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother, whereon his squires gladly stripped the\narmour from off his shoulders. Then Nestor rose and spoke, \u201cOf a truth,\u201d said he, \u201cthe Achaean land is fallen upon\nevil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor and orator among the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house to\nquestion me concerning the race and lineage of all the Argives. How would it not grieve him could he hear of them\nas now quailing before Hector? Many a time would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul might leave his body and\ngo down within the house of Hades. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I were still young and strong\nas when the Pylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river Celadon under the walls of Pheia, and\nround about the waters of the river Iardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood forward as their champion, with\nthe armour of King Areithous upon his shoulders\u2014Areithous whom men and women had surnamed \u2018the Mace-\nman,\u2019 because he fought neither with bow nor spear, but broke the battalions of the foe with his iron mace. Lycurgus\nkilled him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him in a narrow way where his mace served him in no stead; for\nLycurgus was too quick for him and speared him through the middle, so he fell to earth on his back. Lycurgus then\nspoiled him of the armour which Mars had given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but when he grew old\nand stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire Ereuthalion, who in this same armour challenged the foremost\nmen among us. The others quaked and quailed, but my high spirit bade me fight him though none other would\nventure; I was the youngest man of them all; but when I fought him Minerva vouchsafed me victory. He was the\nbiggest and strongest man that ever I killed, and covered much ground as he lay sprawling upon the earth. Would\nthat I were still young and strong as I then was, for the son of Priam would then soon find one who would face him.\nBut you, foremost among the whole host though you be, have none of you any stomach for fighting Hector.\u201d\nThus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started to their feet. Foremost of all uprose King\nAgamemnon, and after him brave Diomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men clothed in valour as\nwith a garment, and then Idomeneus, and Meriones his brother in arms. After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon,\nThoas the son of Andraemon, and Ulysses also rose. Then Nestor knight of Gerene again spoke, saying: \u201cCast lots\namong you to see who shall be chosen. If he come alive out of this fight he will have done good service alike to his\nown soul and to the Achaeans.\u201d\nThus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had thrown it into the helmet of Agamemnon\nson of Atreus, the people lifted their hands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he looked into the vault\nof heaven, \u201cFather Jove, grant that the lot fall on Ajax, or on the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycene\nhimself.\u201d\nAs they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, and from it there fell the very lot which\nthey wanted\u2014the lot of Ajax. The herald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of the Achaeans, going\nfrom left to right; but they none of of them owned it. When, however, in due course he reached the man who had\nwritten upon it and had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, and the herald gave him the lot. When\nAjax saw him mark he knew it and was glad; he threw it to the ground and said, \u201cMy friends, the lot is mine, and I\nrejoice, for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put on my armour; meanwhile, pray to King Jove in silence among your-\nselves that the Trojans may not hear you\u2014or aloud if you will, for we fear no man. None shall overcome me, neither\nby force nor cunning, for I was born and bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things.\u201d\nWith this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and thus would one of them say as he looked into the\nvault of heaven, \u201cFather Jove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victory to Ajax, and let him win\ngreat glory: but if you wish well to Hector also and would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and prowess.\nThus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming bronze. When he was in full array he sprang\nforward as monstrous Mars when he takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with one another\u2014even\nso did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, spring forward with a grim smile on his face as he brandished his long\nspear and strode onward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him, but the Trojans trembled in every limb, and\nthe heart even of Hector beat quickly, but he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks behind him, for he\nhad been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing his shield in front of him like a wall\u2014a shield of bronze with seven\nfolds of oxhide\u2014the work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by far the best worker in leather. He had made it\nwith the hides of seven full-fed bulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. Holding this shield before\nhim, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to Hector, and menaced him saying, \u201cHector, you shall now learn, man\nto man, what kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides lion-hearted Achilles cleaver of the\nranks of men. He now abides at the ships in anger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there are many of\nus who are well able to face you; therefore begin the fight.\u201d\nAnd Hector answered, \u201cNoble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the host, treat me not as though I were some\n136 The Iliad\npuny boy or woman that cannot fight. I have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle. I am quick to\nturn my leathern shield either to right or left, for this I deem the main thing in battle. I can charge among the chari-\nots and horsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of Mars; howbeit I would not take such a man\nas you are off his guard\u2014but I will smite you openly if I can.\u201d\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struck the sevenfold shield in its outermost layer\u2014\nthe eighth, which was of bronze\u2014and went through six of the layers but in the seventh hide it stayed. Then Ajax\nthrew in his turn, and struck the round shield of the son of Priam. The terrible spear went through his gleaming\nshield, and pressed onward through his cuirass of cunning workmanship; it pierced the shirt against his side, but he\nswerved and thus saved his life. They then each of them drew out the spear from his shield, and fell on one another\nlike savage lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance: the son of Priam struck the middle of Ajax\u2019s shield,\nbut the bronze did not break, and the point of his dart was turned. Ajax then sprang forward and pierced the shield\nof Hector; the spear went through it and staggered him as he was springing forward to attack; it gashed his neck\nand the blood came pouring from the wound, but even so Hector did not cease fighting; he gave ground, and with\nhis brawny hand seized a stone, rugged and huge, that was lying upon the plain; with this he struck the shield of\nAjax on the boss that was in its middle, so that the bronze rang again. But Ajax in turn caught up a far larger stone,\nswung it aloft, and hurled it with prodigious force. This millstone of a rock broke Hector\u2019s shield inwards and threw\nhim down on his back with the shield crushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at once. Thereon they would\nhave hacked at one another in close combat with their swords, had not heralds, messengers of gods and men, come\nforward, one from the Trojans and the other from the Achaeans\u2014Talthybius and Idaeus both of them honourable\nmen; these parted them with their staves, and the good herald Idaeus said, \u201cMy sons, fight no longer, you are both\nof you valiant, and both are dear to Jove; we know this; but night is now falling, and the behests of night may not be\nwell gainsaid.\u201d\nAjax son of Telamon answered, \u201cIdaeus, bid Hector say so, for it was he that challenged our princes. Let him\nspeak first and I will accept his saying.\u201d\nThen Hector said, \u201cAjax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and strength, and judgement; and in wielding the\nspear you excel all others of the Achaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting; hereafter we will fight anew till heaven\ndecide between us, and give victory to one or to the other; night is now falling, and the behests of night may not be\nwell gainsaid. Gladden, then, the hearts of the Achaeans at your ships, and more especially those of your own fol-\nlowers and clansmen, while I, in the great city of King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans and their women, who\nvie with one another in their prayers on my behalf. Let us, moreover, exchange presents that it may be said among\nthe Achaeans and Trojans, \u2018They fought with might and main, but were reconciled and parted in friendship.\u2019\nOn this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and leathern baldric, and in return Ajax gave him\na girdle dyed with purple. Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans, and the other to that of the\nTrojans, who rejoiced when they saw their hero come to them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty\nAjax. They led him, therefore, to the city as one that had been saved beyond their hopes. On the other side the\nAchaeans brought Ajax elated with victory to Agamemnon.\nWhen they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon sacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in\nhonour of Jove the son of Saturn. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into joints; these they cut\ncarefully up into smaller pieces, putting them on the spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them off.\nWhen they had done all this and had prepared the feast, they ate it, and every man had his full and equal share,\nso that all were satisfied, and King Agamemnon gave Ajax some slices cut lengthways down the loin, as a mark of\nspecial honour. As soon as they had had enough to cat and drink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest began\nto speak; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:\u2014\n\u201cSon of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the Achaeans are now dead, whose blood Mars has\nshed by the banks of the Scamander, and their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, it will be well when\nmorning comes that we should cease fighting; we will then wheel our dead together with oxen and mules and burn\nthem not far from the ships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of our comrades home to their chil-\ndren. Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrow that shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near\nthis let us set about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our ships, and let it have well-made gates that\nthere may be a way through them for our chariots. Close outside we will dig a deep trench all round it to keep off\nboth horse and foot, that the Trojan chieftains may not bear hard upon us.\u201d\nThus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile the Trojans held a council, angry and full of\ndiscord, on the acropolis by the gates of King Priam\u2019s palace; and wise Antenor spoke. \u201cHear me he said, \u201cTrojans, Dar-\ndanians, and allies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the sons of\nAtreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemn covenants, and shall not prosper till we have done as I say.\u201d\nHe then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to speak. \u201cAntenor,\u201d said he, \u201cyour words are\nnot to my liking; you can find a better saying than this if you will; if, however, you have spoken in good earnest,\n137 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthen indeed has heaven robbed you of your reason. I will speak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans that I will\nnot give up the woman; but the wealth that I brought home with her from Argos I will restore, and will add yet\nfurther of my own.\u201d\nOn this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the race of Dardanus, peer of gods in council,\nrose and with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: \u201cHear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may\nspeak even as I am minded. Get your suppers now as hitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be\nwakeful. At daybreak let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon and Menelaus sons of Atreus the saying of\nAlexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about; and let him also be instant with them that they now cease\nfighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between us and give victory to one or\nto the other.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took supper in their companies and at daybreak\nIdaeus went his wa to the ships. He found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the stern of Agamemnon\u2019s\nship, and took his place in the midst of them. \u201cSon of Atreus,\u201d he said, \u201cand princes of the Achaean host, Priam and\nthe other noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel has come\nabout, if so be that you may find it acceptable. All the treasure he took with him in his ships to Troy\u2014would that he\nhad sooner perished\u2014he will restore, and will add yet further of his own, but he will not give up the wedded wife of\nMenelaus, though the Trojans would have him do so. Priam bade me inquire further if you will cease fighting till we\nburn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between us and give victory to one or to the other.\u201d\nThey all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud war-cry spoke, saying, \u201cLet there be no taking, nei-\nther treasure, nor yet Helen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojans is at hand.\u201d\nThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomed had spoken, and thereon King Agamem-\nnon said to Idaeus, \u201cIdaeus, you have heard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But as concerning\nthe dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men are once dead there should be no grudging them the rites of\nfire. Let Jove the mighty husband of Juno be witness to this covenant.\u201d\nAs he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods, and Idaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius.\nThe Trojans and Dardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when he came, he stood in their midst and\ndelivered his message. As soon as they heard it they set about their twofold labour, some to gather the corpses, and\nothers to bring in wood. The Argives on their part also hastened from their ships, some to gather the corpses, and\nothers to bring in wood.\nThe sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into the vault of heaven from the slow still currents of\ndeep Oceanus, when the two armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but they washed the clotted gore\nfrom off them, shed tears over them, and lifted them upon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans to wail\naloud, so they heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the pyre, and having burned them went back to the city of\nIlius. The Achaeans in like manner heaped their dead sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned them went\nback to their ships.\nNow in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the Achaeans were gathered round the pyre and\nbuilt one barrow that was raised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall to shelter themselves and\ntheir ships; they gave it strong gates that there might be a way through them for their chariots, and close outside it\nthey dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it within with stakes.\nThus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Jove the lord of lightning, marvelled at their great\nwork; but Neptune, lord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, \u201cFather Jove, what mortal in the whole world will again take\nthe gods into his counsel? See you not how the Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven a trench all\nround it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The The fame of this wall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men\nwill no longer think anything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself built with so much labour for Laomedon.\u201d\nJove was displeased and answered, \u201cWhat, O shaker of the earth, are you talking about? A god less powerful\nthan yourself might be alarmed at what they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawn itself. Surely when the\nAchaeans have gone home with their ships, you can shatter their wall and Ring it into the sea; you can cover the\nbeach with sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then be utterly effaced.\u201d\nThus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans was completed; they then slaughtered oxen at\ntheir tents and got their supper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneus the son of Jason,\nborn to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freighted them with ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent\nspecially to the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply the Achaeans bought their wine, some\nwith bronze, some with iron, some with hides, some with whole heifers, and some again with captives. They spread\na goodly banquet and feasted the whole night through, as also did the Trojans and their allies in the city. But all the\ntime Jove boded them ill and roared with his portentous thunder. Pale fear got hold upon them, and they spilled the\nwine from their cups on to the ground, nor did any dare drink till he had made offerings to the most mighty son of\nSaturn. Then they laid themselves down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.\n138 The Iliad\nBook VIII\nNOW when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuse light over the earth, Jove called the gods\nin council on the topmost crest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gave ear. \u201cHear me,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cgods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded. Let none of you neither goddess nor god try\nto cross me, but obey me every one of you that I may bring this matter to an end. If I see anyone acting apart and\nhelping either Trojans or Danaans, he shall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again to Olympus; or I will\nhurl him down into dark Tartarus far into the deepest pit under the earth, where the gates are iron and the floor\nbronze, as far beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, that you may learn how much the mightiest I am\namong you. Try me and find out for yourselves. Hangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of it all of you,\ngods and goddesses together\u2014tug as you will, you will not drag Jove the supreme counsellor from heaven to earth;\nbut were I to pull at it myself I should draw you up with earth and sea into the bargain, then would I bind the chain\nabout some pinnacle of Olympus and leave you all dangling in the mid firmament. So far am I above all others\neither of gods or men.\u201d\nThey were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he had spoken masterfully; but at last Minerva an-\nswered, \u201cFather, son of Saturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to be gainsaid, but we are also sorry\nfor the Danaan warriors, who are perishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain\nfrom actual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to the Argives that they may not all of them perish in\nyour displeasure.\u201d\nJove smiled at her and answered, \u201cTake heart, my child, Trito-born; I am not really in earnest, and I wish to be\nkind to you.\u201d\nWith this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and manes of glittering gold. He girded himself also\nwith gold about the body, seized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereon he lashed his horses and\nthey flew forward nothing loth midway twixt earth and starry heaven. After a while he reached many-fountained\nIda, mother of wild beasts, and Gargarus, where are his grove and fragrant altar. There the father of gods and men\nstayed his horses, took them from the chariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then he took his seat all glorious upon\nthe topmost crests, looking down upon the city of Troy and the ships of the Achaeans.\nThe Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and afterwards put on their armour. The Trojans on\nthe other hand likewise armed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but nevertheless eager perforce to\ndo battle for their wives and children. All the gates were flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forth with the\ntramp as of a great multitude.\nWhen they were got together in one place, shield clashed with shield, and spear with spear, in the conflict of\nmail-clad men. Mighty was the din as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another\u2014death\u2014cry and shout of\ntriumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with blood.\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their weapons beat against one another, and the people\nfell, but when the sun had reached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his golden scales, and put two fates of death\nwithin them, one for the Trojans and the other for the Achaeans. He took the balance by the middle, and when he\nlifted it up the day of the Achaeans sank; the death-fraught scale of the Achaeans settled down upon the ground,\nwhile that of the Trojans rose heavenwards. Then he thundered aloud from Ida, and sent the glare of his lightning\nupon the Achaeans; when they saw this, pale fear fell upon them and they were sore afraid.\nIdomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two Ajaxes, servants of Mars, hold their ground.\nNestor knight of Gerene alone stood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own will, but one of his horses was\ndisabled. Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen had hit it with an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane\nbegins to grow away from the skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded in his anguish as the arrow pierced his\nbrain, and his struggles threw others into confusion. The old man instantly began cutting the traces with his sword,\nbut Hector\u2019s fleet horses bore down upon him through the rout with their bold charioteer, even Hector himself, and\nthe old man would have perished there and then had not Diomed been quick to mark, and with a loud cry called\nUlysses to help him.\n\u201cUlysses,\u201d he cried, \u201cnoble son of Laertes where are you flying to, with your back turned like a coward? See that\nyou are not struck with a spear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defend Nestor from this man\u2019s\nfurious onset.\u201d\nUlysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the Achaeans, and the son of Tydeus flinging him-\nself alone into the thick of the fight took his stand before the horses of the son of Neleus. \u201cSir,\u201d said he, \u201cthese young\nwarriors are pressing you hard, your force is spent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught, and your hors-\nes are slow to move. Mount my chariot and see what the horses of Tros can do\u2014how cleverly they can scud hither\nand thither over the plain either in flight or in pursuit. I took them from the hero Aeneas. Let our squires attend to\n139 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nyour own steeds, but let us drive mine straight at the Trojans, that Hector may learn how furiously I too can wield\nmy spear.\u201d\nNestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon the doughty squires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted\nEurymedon, saw to Nestor\u2019s horses, while the two both mounted Diomed\u2019s chariot. Nestor took the reins in his\nhands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close up with Hector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him\nas he was charging full speed towards them. He missed him, but struck his charioteer and squire Eniopeus son of\nnoble Thebaeus in the breast by the nipple while the reins were in his hands, so that he died there and then, and the\nhorses swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot. Hector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let\nhim lie for all his sorrow, while he went in quest of another driver; nor did his steeds have to go long without one,\nfor he presently found brave Archeptolemus the son of Iphitus, and made him get up behind the horses, giving the\nreins into his hand.\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have been penned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the\nsire of gods and men been quick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt which fell just in front of Diomed\u2019s\nhorses with a flare of burning brimstone. The horses were frightened and tried to back beneath the car, while the\nreins dropped from Nestor\u2019s hands. Then he was afraid and said to Diomed, \u201cSon of Tydeus, turn your horses in\nflight; see you not that the hand of Jove is against you? To-day he vouchsafes victory to Hector; to-morrow, if it so\nplease him, he will again grant it to ourselves; no man, however brave, may thwart the purpose of Jove, for he is far\nstronger than any.\u201d\nDiomed answered, \u201cAll that you have said is true; there is a grief however which pierces me to the very heart,\nfor Hector will talk among the Trojans and say, \u2018The son of Tydeus fled before me to the ships.\u2019 This is the vaunt he\nwill make, and may earth then swallow me.\u201d\n\u201cSon of Tydeus,\u201d replied Nestor, \u201cwhat mean you? Though Hector say that you are a coward the Trojans and\nDardanians will not believe him, nor yet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low.\u201d\nSo saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle, and with a cry that rent the air the Trojans\nand Hector rained their darts after them. Hector shouted to him and said, \u201cSon of Tydeus, the Danaans have done\nyou honour hitherto as regards your place at table, the meals they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine.\nHenceforth they will despise you, for you are become no better than a woman. Be off, girl and coward that you are,\nyou shall not scale our walls through any flinching upon my part; neither shall you carry off our wives in your ships,\nfor I shall kill you with my own hand.\u201d\nThe son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his horses round again and fight him. Thrice did he\ndoubt, and thrice did Jove thunder from the heights of Ida in token to the Trojans that he would turn the battle in\ntheir favour. Hector then shouted to them and said, \u201cTrojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, lovers of close fighting, be\nmen, my friends, and fight with might and with main; I see that Jove is minded to vouchsafe victory and great glory\nto myself, while he will deal destruction upon the Danaans. Fools, for having thought of building this weak and\nworthless wall. It shall not stay my fury; my horses will spring lightly over their trench, and when I am at their ships\nforget not to bring me fire that I may burn them, while I slaughter the Argives who will be all dazed and bewildered\nby the smoke.\u201d\nThen he cried to his horses, \u201cXanthus and Podargus, and you Aethon and goodly Lampus, pay me for your keep\nnow and for all the honey-sweet corn with which Andromache daughter of great Eetion has fed you, and for she has\nmixed wine and water for you to drink whenever you would, before doing so even for me who am her own hus-\nband. Haste in pursuit, that we may take the shield of Nestor, the fame of which ascends to heaven, for it is of solid\ngold, arm-rods and all, and that we may strip from the shoulders of Diomed. the cuirass which Vulcan made him.\nCould we take these two things, the Achaeans would set sail in their ships this self-same night.\u201d\nThus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as she shook with rage upon her throne. Then\nsaid she to the mighty god of Neptune, \u201cWhat now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can you find no compas-\nsion in your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring you many a welcome offering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish\nthem well then. If all of us who are with the Danaans were to drive the Trojans back and keep Jove from helping\nthem, he would have to sit there sulking alone on Ida.\u201d\nKing Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, \u201cJuno, rash of tongue, what are you talking about? We other\ngods must not set ourselves against Jove, for he is far stronger than we are.\u201d\nThus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch, from the ships even to the wall, was filled\nwith horses and warriors, who were pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now that the hand of Jove was with him.\nHe would even have set fire to the ships and burned them, had not Queen Juno put it into the mind of Agamem-\nnon, to bestir himself and to encourage the Achaeans. To this end he went round the ships and tents carrying a\ngreat purple cloak, and took his stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses\u2019 ship, which was middlemost of all; it was\nfrom this place that his voice would carry farthest, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and\non the other towards those of Achilles\u2014for these two heroes, well assured of their own strength, had valorously\n140 The Iliad\ndrawn up their ships at the two ends of the line. From this spot then, with a voice that could be heard afar, he shout-\ned to the Danaans, saying, \u201cArgives, shame on you cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only; where are now our\nvaunts that we should prove victorious\u2014the vaunts we made so vaingloriously in Lemnos, when we ate the flesh\nof horned cattle and filled our mixing-bowls to the brim? You vowed that you would each of you stand against a\nhundred or two hundred men, and now you prove no match even for one\u2014for Hector, who will be ere long setting\nour ships in a blaze. Father Jove, did you ever so ruin a great king and rob him so utterly of his greatness? yet, when\nto my sorrow I was coming hither, I never let my ship pass your altars without offering the fat and thigh-bones of\nheifers upon every one of them, so eager was I to sack the city of Troy. Vouchsafe me then this prayer\u2014suffer us to\nescape at any rate with our lives, and let not the Achaeans be so utterly vanquished by the Trojans.\u201d\nThus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed him that his people should live, not die; forthwith\nhe sent them an eagle, most unfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in its talons; the eagle dropped\nthe fawn by the altar on which the Achaeans sacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; When, therefore, the people saw\nthat the bird had come from Jove, they sprang more fiercely upon the Trojans and fought more boldly.\nThere was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast that he had driven his horses over the trench\nand gone forth to fight sooner than the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so he slew an armed war-\nrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the son of Phradmon. He had turned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the\nback midway between his shoulders and went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round him as he\nfell forward from his chariot.\nAfter him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the two Ajaxes clothed in valour as with a garment,\nIdomeneus and his companion in arms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylus the brave son of Euae-\nmon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took his place under cover of the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When\nAjax lifted his shield Teucer would peer round, and when he had hit any one in the throng, the man would fall\ndead; then Teucer would hie back to Ajax as a child to its mother, and again duck down under his shield.\nWhich of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, and then Ormenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chro-\nmius, and godlike Lycophontes, Amopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. these in turn did he lay low upon\nthe earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he saw him making havoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He\nwent up to him and said, \u201cTeucer, man after my own heart, son of Telamon, captain among the host, shoot on, and\nbe at once the saving of the Danaans and the glory of your father Telamon, who brought you up and took care of\nyou in his own house when you were a child, bastard though you were. Cover him with glory though he is far off; I\nwill promise and I will assuredly perform; if aegis-bearing Jove and Minerva grant me to sack the city of Ilius, you\nshall have the next best meed of honour after my own\u2014a tripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman who\nshall go up into your bed.\u201d\nAnd Teucer answered, \u201cMost noble son of Atreus, you need not urge me; from the moment we began to drive\nthem back to Ilius, I have never ceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot and kill; I have\nshot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have been buried in the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog I cannot\nhit.\u201d\nAs he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was bent on hitting him; nevertheless he missed\nhim, and the arrow hit Priam\u2019s brave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fair Castianeira, lovely as a goddess,\nhad been married from Aesyme, and now he bowed his head as a garden poppy in full bloom when it is weighed\ndown by showers in spring\u2014even thus heavy bowed his head beneath the weight of his helmet.\nAgain he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and again his arrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside;\nbut he hit Hector\u2019s brave charioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he was driving furiously into the\nfight. The horses swerved aside as he fell headlong from the chariot, and there was no life left in him. Hector was\ngreatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but for all his sorrow he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brother\nCebriones, who was hard by, take the reins. Cebriones did as he had said. Hector thereon with a loud cry sprang\nfrom his chariot to the ground, and seizing a great stone made straight for Teucer with intent kill him. Teucer had\njust taken an arrow from his quiver and had laid it upon the bow-string, but Hector struck him with the jagged\nstone as he was taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; he hit him just where the collar-bone divides\nthe neck from the chest, a very deadly place, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his wrist was less, and the bow\ndropped from his hand as he fell forward on his knees. Ajax saw that his brother had fallen, and running towards\nhim bestrode him and sheltered him with his shield. Meanwhile his two trusty squires, Mecisteus son of Echius, and\nAlastor, came up and bore him to the ships groaning in his great pain. glad when he saw\nJove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the Achaeans to their deep trench with Hector in\nall his glory at their head. As a hound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when he gives him chase, and\nwatches warily for his wheeling, even so did Hector follow close upon the Achaeans, ever killing the hindmost as\nthey rushed panic-stricken onwards. When they had fled through the set stakes and trench and many Achaeans\nhad been laid low at the hands of the Trojans, they halted at their ships, calling upon one another and praying every\n141 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nman instantly as they lifted up their hands to the gods; but Hector wheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes\nglaring like those of Gorgo or murderous Mars.\nJuno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to Minerva, \u201cAlas, child of aegis-bearing Jove,\nshall you and I take no more thought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we ever do so? See how they\nperish and come to a bad end before the onset of but a single man. Hector the son of Priam rages with intolerable\nfury, and has already done great mischief.\u201d\nMinerva answered, \u201cWould, indeed, this fellow might die in his own land, and fall by the hands of the Achae-\nans; but my father Jove is mad with spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgets how often I\nsaved his son when he was worn out by the labours Eurystheus had laid on him. He would weep till his cry came\nup to heaven, and then Jove would send me down to help him; if I had had the sense to foresee all this, when\nEurystheus sent him to the house of Hades, to fetch the hell-hound from Erebus, he would never have come back\nalive out of the deep waters of the river Styx. And now Jove hates me, while he lets Thetis have her way because she\nkissed his knees and took hold of his beard, when she was begging him to do honour to Achilles. I shall know what\nto do next time he begins calling me his grey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I go within the house of\naegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; we shall then find out whether Priam\u2019s son Hector will be glad to meet us\nin the highways of battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds and vultures with the fat of their flesh as they he\ndead by the ships of the Achaeans.\u201d\nThus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great Saturn, obeyed her words; she set about harness-\ning her gold-bedizened steeds, while Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing Jove flung her richly vesture, made with\nher own hands, on to the threshold of her father, and donned the shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle. Then she\nstepped into her flaming chariot, and grasped the spear so stout and sturdy and strong with which she quells the\nranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno lashed her horses, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew open\nof their own accord\u2014gates over which the Hours preside, in whose hands are heaven and Olympus, either to open\nthe dense cloud that hides them or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds.\nBut father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sent winged Iris with a message to them. \u201cGo,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cfleet Iris, turn them back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come to fighting there will be\nmischief. This is what I say, and this is what I mean to do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl them from\ntheir chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take them all ten years to heal the wounds my lightning shall inflict\nupon them; my grey-eyed daughter will then learn what quarrelling with her father means. I am less surprised and\nangry with Juno, for whatever I say she always contradicts me.\u201d\nWith this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights of Ida to the lofty summits of Olympus. She met\nthe goddesses at the outer gates of its many valleys and gave them her message. \u201cWhat,\u201d said she, \u201care you about?\nAre you mad? The son of Saturn forbids going. This is what he says, and this is he means to do, he will lame your\nhorses for you, he will hurl you from your chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take you all ten years to heal\nthe wounds his lightning will inflict upon you, that you may learn, grey-eyed goddess, what quarrelling with your\nfather means. He is less hurt and angry with Juno, for whatever he says she always contradicts him but you, bold\nbold hussy, will you really dare to raise your huge spear in defiance of Jove?\u201d\nWith this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, \u201cOf a truth, child of aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting\nmen\u2019s battles further in defiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will have it, and let Jove mete out his judge-\nments upon the Trojans and Danaans according to his own pleasure.\u201d\nShe turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made them fast to their ambrosial mangers, and\nleaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upon their golden\nthrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they were very angry.\nPresently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered the assembly of gods. The mighty lord of the\nearthquake unyoked his horses for him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it. Jove then sat down\nupon his golden throne and Olympus reeled beneath him. Minerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove, and neither\nspoke nor asked him questions, but Jove knew what they meant, and said, \u201cMinerva and Juno, why are you so\nangry? Are you fatigued with killing so many of your dear friends the Trojans? Be this as it may, such is the might\nof my hands that all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you were both of you trembling all over ere ever you saw\nthe fight and its terrible doings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been\u2014I should have struck you with\nlighting, and your chariots would never have brought you back again to Olympus.\u201d\nMinerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and brooded mischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat\nsilent without a word, for she was in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against her father; but Juno could not\ncontain herself and said, \u201cWhat, dread son of Saturn, are you talking about? We know how great your power is,\nnevertheless we have compassion upon the Danaan warriors who are perishing and coming to a bad end. We will,\nhowever, since you so bid us, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to the Argives,\nthat they may not all of them perish in your displeasure.\u201d\n142 The Iliad\nAnd Jove answered, \u201cTo-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do so, you will see the son of Saturn de-\nstroying large numbers of the Argives, for fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has roused the son of Peleus\nwhen they are fighting in dire straits at their ships\u2019 sterns about the body of Patroclus. Like it or no, this is how it is\ndecreed; for aught I care, you may go to the lowest depths beneath earth and sea, where Iapetus and Saturn dwell\nin lone Tartarus with neither ray of light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may go on and on till you get there,\nand I shall not care one whit for your displeasure; you are the greatest vixen living.\u201d\nJuno made him no answer. The sun\u2019s glorious orb now sank into Oceanus and drew down night over the land.\nSorry indeed were the Trojans when light failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for did darkness fall upon the\nAchaeans.\nThen Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held a council on the open space near the river, where\nthere was a spot ear corpses. They left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hear the speech he made them.\nHe grasped a spear eleven cubits long, the bronze point of which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round the\nspear-head was of gold Spear in hand he spoke. \u201cHear me,\u201d said he, \u201cTrojans, Dardanians, and allies. I deemed but\nnow that I should destroy the ships and all the Achaeans with them ere I went back to Ilius, but darkness came\non too soon. It was this alone that saved them and their ships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obey the\nbehests of night, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out of their chariots and give them their feeds of corn;\nthen make speed to bring sheep and cattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for your horses and gather much\nwood, that from dark till dawn we may burn watchfires whose flare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may\ntry to fly beyond the sea by night, and they must not embark scatheless and unmolested; many a man among them\nmust take a dart with him to nurse at home, hit with spear or arrow as he is leaping on board his ship, that others\nmay fear to bring war and weeping upon the Trojans. Moreover let the heralds tell it about the city that the growing\nyouths and grey-bearded men are to camp upon its heaven-built walls. Let the women each of them light a great\nfire in her house, and let watch be safely kept lest the town be entered by surprise while the host is outside. See to\nit, brave Trojans, as I have said, and let this suffice for the moment; at daybreak I will instruct you further. I pray\nin hope to Jove and to the gods that we may then drive those fate-sped hounds from our land, for \u2018tis the fates that\nhave borne them and their ships hither. This night, therefore, let us keep watch, but with early morning let us put\non our armour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the Achaeans; I shall then know whether brave Diomed the son\nof Tydeus will drive me back from the ships to the wall, or whether I shall myself slay him and carry off his blood-\nstained spoils. To-morrow let him show his mettle, abide my spear if he dare. I ween that at break of day, he shall be\namong the first to fall and many another of his comrades round him. Would that I were as sure of being immortal\nand never growing old, and of being worshipped like Minerva and Apollo, as I am that this day will bring evil to the\nArgives.\u201d\nThus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They took their sweating steeds from under the yoke,\nand made them fast each by his own chariot. They made haste to bring sheep and cattle from the city, they brought\nwine also and corn from their houses and gathered much wood. They then offered unblemished hecatombs to the\nimmortals, and the wind carried the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven\u2014but the blessed gods partook not thereof,\nfor they bitterly hated Ilius with Priam and Priam\u2019s people. Thus high in hope they sat through the livelong night by\nthe highways of war, and many a watchfire did they kindle. As when the stars shine clear, and the moon is bright\u2014\nthere is not a breath of air, not a peak nor glade nor jutting headland but it stands out in the ineffable radiance that\nbreaks from the serene of heaven; the stars can all of them be told and the heart of the shepherd is glad\u2014even thus\nshone the watchfires of the Trojans before Ilius midway between the ships and the river Xanthus. A thousand camp-\nfires gleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of each there sat fifty men, while the horses, champing oats and corn\nbeside their chariots, waited till dawn should come.\nBook IX\nTHUS did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of blood-stained Rout, had taken fast hold of the Achaeans\nand their princes were all of them in despair. As when the two winds that blow from Thrace\u2014the north and the\nnorthwest\u2014spring up of a sudden and rouse the fury of the main\u2014in a moment the dark waves uprear their heads\nand scatter their sea-wrack in all directions\u2014even thus troubled were the hearts of the Achaeans.\nThe son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to a council man by man, but not to cry the matter\naloud; he made haste also himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in their assembly. Agamemnon shed tears\nas it were a running stream or cataract on the side of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh he spoke\nto the Achaeans. \u201cMy friends,\u201d said he, \u201cprinces and councillors of the Argives, the hand of heaven has been laid\nheavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise that I should sack the city of Troy before returning, but\nhe has played me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people. Such is\nthe will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dust as he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. Now,\n143 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ntherefore, let us all do as I say and sail back to our own country, for we shall not take Troy.\u201d\nThus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans for a long while sat sorrowful there, but they all held their peace,\ntill at last Diomed of the loud battle-cry made answer saying, \u201cSon of Atreus, I will chide your folly, as is my right\nin council. Be not then aggrieved that I should do so. In the first place you attacked me before all the Danaans and\nsaid that I was a coward and no soldier. The Argives young and old know that you did so. But the son of scheming\nSaturn endowed you by halves only. He gave you honour as the chief ruler over us, but valour, which is the highest\nboth right and might he did not give you. Sir, think you that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlike and\ncowardly as you say they are? If your own mind is set upon going home\u2014go\u2014the way is open to you; the many\nships that followed you from Mycene stand ranged upon the seashore; but the rest of us stay here till we have sacked\nTroy. Nay though these too should turn homeward with their ships, Sthenelus and myself will still fight on till we\nreach the goal of Ilius, for for heaven was with us when we came.\u201d\nThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomed, and presently Nestor rose to speak. \u201cSon of\nTydeus,\u201d said he, \u201cin war your prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all who are of your own years;\nno one of the Achaeans can make light of what you say nor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the end of the\nwhole matter. You are still young\u2014you might be the youngest of my own children\u2014still you have spoken wisely\nand have counselled the chief of the Achaeans not without discretion; nevertheless I am older than you and I will\ntell you every\u201d thing; therefore let no man, not even King Agamemnon, disregard my saying, for he that foments\ncivil discord is a clanless, hearthless outlaw.\n\u201cNow, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our suppers, but let the sentinels every man of them\ncamp by the trench that is without the wall. I am giving these instructions to the young men; when they have been\nattended to, do you, son of Atreus, give your orders, for you are the most royal among us all. Prepare a feast for your\ncouncillors; it is right and reasonable that you should do so; there is abundance of wine in your tents, which the\nships of the Achaeans bring from Thrace daily. You have everything at your disposal wherewith to entertain guests,\nand you have many subjects. When many are got together, you can be guided by him whose counsel is wisest\u2014and\nsorely do we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe has lit his watchfires hard by our ships. Who can be oth-\ner than dismayed? This night will either be the ruin of our host, or save it.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The sentinels went out in their armour under command of\nNestor\u2019s son Thrasymedes, a captain of the host, and of the bold warriors Ascalaphus and Ialmenus: there were also\nMeriones, Aphareus and Deipyrus, and the son of Creion, noble Lycomedes. There were seven captains of the sen-\ntinels, and with each there went a hundred youths armed with long spears: they took their places midway between\nthe trench and the wall, and when they had done so they lit their fires and got every man his supper.\nThe son of Atreus then bade many councillors of the Achaeans to his quarters prepared a great feast in their\nhonour. They laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had enough to eat and\ndrink, old Nestor, whose counsel was ever truest, was the first to lay his mind before them. He, therefore, with all\nsincerity and goodwill addressed them thus.\n\u201cWith yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, will I both begin my speech and end it,\nfor you are king over much people. Jove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the sceptre and to uphold righ-\nteousness, that you may take thought for your people under you; therefore it behooves you above all others both to\nspeak and to give ear, and to out the counsel of another who shall have been minded to speak wisely. All turns on\nyou and on your commands, therefore I will say what I think will be best. No man will be of a truer mind than that\nwhich has been mine from the hour when you, sir, angered Achilles by taking the girl Briseis from his tent against\nmy judgment. I urged you not to do so, but you yielded to your own pride, and dishonoured a hero whom heaven\nitself had honoured\u2014for you still hold the prize that had been awarded to him. Now, however, let us think how we\nmay appease him, both with presents and fair speeches that may conciliate him.\u201d\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \u201cSir, you have reproved my folly justly. I was wrong. I own it. One whom\nheaven befriends is in himself a host, and Jove has shown that he befriends this man by destroying much people of\nthe Achaeans. I was blinded with passion and yielded to my worser mind; therefore I will make amends, and will\ngive him great gifts by way of atonement. I will tell them in the presence of you all. I will give him seven tripods\nthat have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of gold. I will give him twenty iron cauldrons and twelve strong\nhorses that have won races and carried off prizes. Rich, indeed, both in land and gold is he that has as many prizes\nas my horses have won me. I will give him seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom I chose for myself when he\ntook Lesbos\u2014all of surpassing beauty. I will give him these, and with them her whom I erewhile took from him, the\ndaughter of Briseus; and I swear a great oath that I never went up into her couch, nor have been with her after the\nmanner of men and women.\n\u201cAll these things will I give him now down, and if hereafter the gods vouchsafe me to sack the city of Priam, let\nhim come when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold and bronze to his liking; further-\nmore let him take twenty Trojan women, the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean Argos,\n144 The Iliad\nwealthiest of all lands, he shall be my son-in-law and I will show him like honour with my own dear son Orestes,\nwho is being nurtured in all abundance. I have three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, and lphianassa, let him\ntake the one of his choice, freely and without gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; I will add such dower to boot\nas no man ever yet gave his daughter, and will give him seven well established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire,\nwhere there is grass; holy Pherae and the rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus,\nall near the sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will\nhonour him with gifts as though he were a god, and be obedient to his comfortable ordinances. All this will I do if\nhe will now forgo his anger. Let him then yieldit is only Hades who is utterly ruthless and unyielding\u2014and hence he\nis of all gods the one most hateful to mankind. Moreover I am older and more royal than himself. Therefore, let him\nnow obey me.\u201d\nThen Nestor answered, \u201cMost noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon. The gifts you offer are no small\nones, let us then send chosen messengers, who may go to the tent of Achilles son of Peleus without delay. Let those\ngo whom I shall name. Let Phoenix, dear to Jove, lead the way; let Ajax and Ulysses follow, and let the heralds Odi-\nus and Eurybates go with them. Now bring water for our hands, and bid all keep silence while we pray to Jove the\nson of Saturn, if so be that he may have mercy upon us.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men-servants poured water over the hands of the guests,\nwhile pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink-of-\nfering; then, when they had made their offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the envoys set out\nfrom the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; and Nestor, looking first to one and then to another, but most especial-\nly at Ulysses, was instant with them that they should prevail with the noble son of Peleus.\nThey went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayed earnestly to earth-encircling Neptune that the\nhigh spirit of the son of Aeacus might incline favourably towards them. When they reached the ships and tents of\nthe Myrmidons, they found Achilles playing on a lyre, fair, of cunning workmanship, and its cross-bar was of silver.\nIt was part of the spoils which he had taken when he sacked the city of Eetion, and he was now diverting himself\nwith it and singing the feats of heroes. He was alone with Patroclus, who sat opposite to him and said nothing,\nwaiting till he should cease singing. Ulysses and Ajax now came in\u2014Ulysses leading the way\u2014and stood before\nhim. Achilles sprang from his seat with the lyre still in his hand, and Patroclus, when he saw the strangers, rose also.\nAchilles then greeted them saying, \u201cAll hail and welcome\u2014you must come upon some great matter, you, who for all\nmy anger are still dearest to me of the Achaeans.\u201d\nWith this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats covered with purple rugs; then he said to Patroclus\nwho was close by him, \u201cSon of Menoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less water with the wine, and give\nevery man his cup, for these are very dear friends, who are now under my roof.\u201d\nPatroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-block in front of the fire, and on it he laid the loin\nof a sheep, the loin also of a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. Automedon held the meat while Achilles chopped it; he\nthen sliced the pieces and put them on spits while the son of Menoetius made the fire burn high. When the flame\nhad died down, he spread the embers, laid the spits on top of them, lifting them up and setting them upon the spit-\nracks; and he sprinkled them with salt. When the meat was roasted, he set it on platters, and handed bread round\nthe table in fair baskets, while Achilles dealt them their portions. Then Achilles took his seat facing Ulysses against\nthe opposite wall, and bade his comrade Patroclus offer sacrifice to the gods; so he cast the offerings into the fire,\nand they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\ndrink, Ajax made a sign to Phoenix, and when he saw this, Ulysses filled his cup with wine and pledged Achilles.\n\u201cHail,\u201d said he, \u201cAchilles, we have had no scant of good cheer, neither in the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here;\nthere has been plenty to eat and drink, but our thought turns upon no such matter. Sir, we are in the face of great\ndisaster, and without your help know not whether we shall save our fleet or lose it. The Trojans and their allies have\ncamped hard by our ships and by the wall; they have lit watchfires throughout their host and deem that nothing can\nnow prevent them from falling on our fleet. Jove, moreover, has sent his lightnings on their right; Hector, in all his\nglory, rages like a maniac; confident that Jove is with him he fears neither god nor man, but is gone raving mad, and\nprays for the approach of day. He vows that he will hew the high sterns of our ships in pieces, set fire to their hulls,\nand make havoc of the Achaeans while they are dazed and smothered in smoke; I much fear that heaven will make\ngood his boasting, and it will prove our lot to perish at Troy far from our home in Argos. Up, then, and late though\nit be, save the sons of the Achaeans who faint before the fury of the Trojans. You will repent bitterly hereafter if you\ndo not, for when the harm is done there will be no curing it; consider ere it be too late, and save the Danaans from\ndestruction.\n\u201cMy good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon, did he not charge you say-\ning, \u2018Son, Minerva and Juno will make you strong if they choose, but check your high temper, for the better part is\nin goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and the Achaeans old and young will respect you more for doing so.\u2019 These\nwere his words, but you have forgotten them. Even now, however, be appeased, and put away your anger from you.\n145 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAgamemnon will make you great amends if you will forgive him; listen, and I will tell you what he has said in his\ntent that he will give you. He will give you seven tripods that have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of gold;\ntwenty iron cauldrons, and twelve strong horses that have won races and carried off prizes. Rich indeed both in land\nand gold is he who has as many prizes as these horses have won for Agamemnon. Moreover he will give you seven\nexcellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom he chose for himself, when you took Lesbos\u2014all of surpassing beauty. He\nwill give you these, and with them her whom he erewhile took from you, the daughter of Briseus, and he will swear\na great oath, he has never gone up into her couch nor been with her after the manner of men and women. All these\nthings will he give you now down, and if hereafter the gods vouchsafe him to sack the city of Priam, you can come\nwhen we Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and load your ship with gold and bronze to your liking. You can take\ntwenty Trojan women, the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean Argos, wealthiest of all lands,\nyou shall be his son-in-law, and he will show you like honour with his own dear son Orestes, who is being nurtured\nin all abundance. Agamemnon has three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa; you may take the one\nof your choice, freely and without gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; he will add such dower to boot as no man\never yet gave his daughter, and will give you seven well-established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire where there\nis grass; holy Pheras and the rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, all near\nthe sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will honour\nyou with gifts as though were a god, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances. All this will he do if you will\nnow forgo your anger. Moreover, though you hate both him and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the rest of the\nAchaeans who are being harassed in all their host; they will honour you as a god, and you will earn great glory at\ntheir hands. You might even kill Hector; he will come within your reach, for he is infatuated, and declares that not a\nDanaan whom the ships have brought can hold his own against him.\u201d\nAchilles answered, \u201cUlysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give you formal notice plainly and in all fixity of\npurpose that there be no more of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come. Him do I hate even as the\ngates of hell who says one thing while he hides another in his heart; therefore I will say what I mean. I will be\nappeased neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any other of the Danaans, for I see that I have no thanks for\nall my fighting. He that fights fares no better than he that does not; coward and hero are held in equal honour, and\ndeath deals like measure to him who works and him who is idle. I have taken nothing by all my hardships\u2014with my\nlife ever in my hand; as a bird when she has found a morsel takes it to her nestlings, and herself fares hardly, even so\nman a long night have I been wakeful, and many a bloody battle have I waged by day against those who were fight-\ning for their women. With my ships I have taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormed with my\nmen by land; I took great store of wealth from every one of them, but I gave all up to Agamemnon son of Atreus.\nHe stayed where he was by his ships, yet of what came to him he gave little, and kept much himself.\n\u201cNevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among the chieftains and kings, and these have them\nstill; from me alone of the Achaeans did he take the woman in whom I delighted\u2014let him keep her and sleep with\nher. Why, pray, must the Argives needs fight the Trojans? What made the son of Atreus gather the host and bring\nthem? Was it not for the sake of Helen? Are the sons of Atreus the only men in the world who love their wives?\nAny man of common right feeling will love and cherish her who is his own, as I this woman, with my whole heart,\nthough she was but a fruitling of my spear. Agamemnon has taken her from me; he has played me false; I know\nhim; let him tempt me no further, for he shall not move me. Let him look to you, Ulysses, and to the other princes\nto save his ships from burning. He has done much without me already. He has built a wall; he has dug a trench deep\nand wide all round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; but even so he stays not the murderous might of\nHector. So long as I fought the Achaeans Hector suffered not the battle range far from the city walls; he would come\nto the Scaean gates and to the oak tree, but no further. Once he stayed to meet me and hardly did he escape my\nonset: now, however, since I am in no mood to fight him, I will to-morrow offer sacrifice to Jove and to all the gods;\nI will draw my ships into the water and then victual them duly; to-morrow morning, if you care to look, you will\nsee my ships on the Hellespont, and my men rowing out to sea with might and main. If great Neptune vouchsafes\nme a fair passage, in three days I shall be in Phthia. I have much there that I left behind me when I came here to my\nsorrow, and I shall bring back still further store of gold, of red copper, of fair women, and of iron, my share of the\nspoils that we have taken; but one prize, he who gave has insolently taken away. Tell him all as I now bid you, and\ntell him in public that the Achaeans may hate him and beware of him should he think that he can yet dupe others\nfor his effrontery never fails him.\n\u201cAs for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. I will take no counsel with him, and will under-\ntake nothing in common with him. He has wronged me and deceived me enough, he shall not cozen me further;\nlet him go his own way, for Jove has robbed him of his reason. I loathe his presents, and for himself care not one\nstraw. He may offer me ten or even twenty times what he has now done, nay\u2014not though it be all that he has in the\nworld, both now or ever shall have; he may promise me the wealth of Orchomenus or of Egyptian Thebes, which is\nthe richest city in the whole world, for it has a hundred gates through each of which two hundred men may drive at\n146 The Iliad\nonce with their chariots and horses; he may offer me gifts as the sands of the sea or the dust of the plain in multi-\ntude, but even so he shall not move me till I have been revenged in full for the bitter wrong he has done me. I will\nnot marry his daughter; she may be fair as Venus, and skilful as Minerva, but I will have none of her: let another\ntake her, who may be a good match for her and who rules a larger kingdom. If the gods spare me to return home,\nPeleus will find me a wife; there are Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia, daughters of kings that have cities under\nthem; of these I can take whom I will and marry her. Many a time was I minded when at home in Phthia to woo\nand wed a woman who would make me a suitable wife, and to enjoy the riches of my old father Peleus. My life\nis more to me than all the wealth of Ilius while it was yet at peace before the Achaeans went there, or than all the\ntreasure that lies on the stone floor of Apollo\u2019s temple beneath the cliffs of Pytho. Cattle and sheep are to be had for\nharrying, and a man buy both tripods and horses if he wants them, but when his life has once left him it can neither\nbe bought nor harried back again.\n\u201cMy mother Thetis tells me that there are two ways in which I may meet my end. If I stay here and fight, I shall\nnot return alive but my name will live for ever: whereas if I go home my name will die, but it will be long ere death\nshall take me. To the rest of you, then, I say, \u2018Go home, for you will not take Ilius.\u2019 Jove has held his hand over her to\nprotect her, and her people have taken heart. Go, therefore, as in duty bound, and tell the princes of the Achaeans\nthe message that I have sent them; tell them to find some other plan for the saving of their ships and people, for so\nlong as my displeasure lasts the one that they have now hit upon may not be. As for Phoenix, let him sleep here that\nhe may sail with me in the morning if he so will. But I will not take him by force.\u201d\nThey all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which he had denied them, till presently the old knight\nPhoenix in his great fear for the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and said, \u201cNoble Achilles, if you are now\nminded to return, and in the fierceness of your anger will do nothing to save the ships from burning, how, my son,\ncan I remain here without you? Your father Peleus bade me go with you when he sent you as a mere lad from Phthia\nto Agamemnon. You knew nothing neither of war nor of the arts whereby men make their mark in council, and he\nsent me with you to train you in all excellence of speech and action. Therefore, my son, I will not stay here without\nyou\u2014no, not though heaven itself vouchsafe to strip my years from off me, and make me young as I was when I\nfirst left Hellas the land of fair women. I was then flying the anger of father Amyntor, son of Ormenus, who was\nfurious with me in the matter of his concubine, of whom he was enamoured to the wronging of his wife my mother.\nMy mother, therefore, prayed me without ceasing to lie with the woman myself, that so she hate my father, and in\nthe course of time I yielded. But my father soon came to know, and cursed me bitterly, calling the dread Erinyes to\nwitness. He prayed that no son of mine might ever sit upon knees\u2014and the gods, Jove of the world below and awful\nProserpine, fulfilled his curse. I took counsel to kill him, but some god stayed my rashness and bade me think on\nmen\u2019s evil tongues and how I should be branded as the murderer of my father: nevertheless I could not bear to stay\nin my father\u2019s house with him so bitter a against me. My cousins and clansmen came about me, and pressed me\nsorely to remain; many a sheep and many an ox did they slaughter, and many a fat hog did they set down to roast\nbefore the fire; many a jar, too, did they broach of my father\u2019s wine. Nine whole nights did they set a guard over me\ntaking it in turns to watch, and they kept a fire always burning, both in the cloister of the outer court and in the\ninner court at the doors of the room wherein I lay; but when the darkness of the tenth night came, I broke through\nthe closed doors of my room, and climbed the wall of the outer court after passing quickly and unperceived through\nthe men on guard and the women servants. I then fled through Hellas till I came to fertile Phthia, mother of sheep,\nand to King Peleus, who made me welcome and treated me as a father treats an only son who will be heir to all his\nwealth. He made me rich and set me over much people, establishing me on the borders of Phthia where I was chief\nruler over the Dolopians.\n\u201cIt was I, Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with all my heart: for you would eat neither at home\nnor when you had gone out elsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut up the dainty morsel that you were\nto eat, and held the wine-cup to your lips. Many a time have you slobbered your wine in baby helplessness over\nmy shirt; I had infinite trouble with you, but I knew that heaven had vouchsafed me no offspring of my own, and I\nmade a son of you, Achilles, that in my hour of need you might protect me. Now, therefore, I say battle with your\npride and beat it; cherish not your anger for ever; the might and majesty of heaven are more than ours, but even\nheaven may be appeased; and if a man has sinned he prays the gods, and reconciles them to himself by his piteous\ncries and by frankincense, with drink-offerings and the savour of burnt sacrifice. For prayers are as daughters to\ngreat Jove; halt, wrinkled, with eyes askance, they follow in the footsteps of sin, who, being fierce and fleet of foot,\nleaves them far behind him, and ever baneful to mankind outstrips them even to the ends of the world; but never-\ntheless the prayers come hobbling and healing after. If a man has pity upon these daughters of Jove when they draw\nnear him, they will bless him and hear him too when he is praying; but if he deny them and will not listen to them,\nthey go to Jove the son of Saturn and pray that he may presently fall into sin\u2014to his ruing bitterly hereafter. There-\nfore, Achilles, give these daughters of Jove due reverence, and bow before them as all good men will bow. Were not\nthe son of Atreus offering you gifts and promising others later\u2014if he were still furious and implacable\u2014I am not\n147 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nhe that would bid you throw off your anger and help the Achaeans, no matter how great their need; but he is giving\nmuch now, and more hereafter; he has sent his captains to urge his suit, and has chosen those who of all the Argives\nare most acceptable to you; make not then their words and their coming to be of none effect. Your anger has been\nrighteous so far. We have heard in song how heroes of old time quarrelled when they were roused to fury, but still\nthey could be won by gifts, and fair words could soothe them.\n\u201cI have an old story in my mind\u2014a very old one\u2014but you are all friends and I will tell it. The Curetes and the\nAetolians were fighting and killing one another round Calydon\u2014the Aetolians defending the city and the Curetes\ntrying to destroy it. For Diana of the golden throne was angry and did them hurt because Oeneus had not offered\nher his harvest first-fruits. The other gods had all been feasted with hecatombs, but to the daughter of great Jove\nalone he had made no sacrifice. He had forgotten her, or somehow or other it had escaped him, and this was a\ngrievous sin. Thereon the archer goddess in her displeasure sent a prodigious creature against him\u2014a savage wild\nboar with great white tusks that did much harm to his orchard lands, uprooting apple-trees in full bloom and\nthrowing them to the ground. But Meleager son of Oeneus got huntsmen and hounds from many cities and killed\nit\u2014for it was so monstrous that not a few were needed, and many a man did it stretch upon his funeral pyre. On\nthis the goddess set the Curetes and the Aetolians fighting furiously about the head and skin of the boar.\n\u201cSo long as Meleager was in the field things went badly with the Curetes, and for all their numbers they could\nnot hold their ground under the city walls; but in the course of time Meleager was angered as even a wise man will\nsometimes be. He was incensed with his mother Althaea, and therefore stayed at home with his wedded wife fair\nCleopatra, who was daughter of Marpessa daughter of Euenus, and of Ides the man then living. He it was who took\nhis bow and faced King Apollo himself for fair Marpessa\u2019s sake; her father and mother then named her Alcyone, be-\ncause her mother had mourned with the plaintive strains of the halcyon-bird when Phoebus Apollo had carried her\noff. Meleager, then, stayed at home with Cleopatra, nursing the anger which he felt by reason of his mother\u2019s curses.\nHis mother, grieving for the death of her brother, prayed the gods, and beat the earth with her hands, calling upon\nHades and on awful Proserpine; she went down upon her knees and her bosom was wet with tears as she prayed\nthat they would kill her son\u2014and Erinys that walks in darkness and knows no ruth heard her from Erebus.\n\u201cThen was heard the din of battle about the gates of Calydon, and the dull thump of the battering against their\nwalls. Thereon the elders of the Aetolians besought Meleager; they sent the chiefest of their priests, and begged\nhim to come out and help them, promising him a great reward. They bade him choose fifty plough-gates, the most\nfertile in the plain of Calydon, the one-half vineyard and the other open plough-land. The old warrior Oeneus im-\nplored him, standing at the threshold of his room and beating the doors in supplication. His sisters and his mother\nherself besought him sore, but he the more refused them; those of his comrades who were nearest and dearest to\nhim also prayed him, but they could not move him till the foe was battering at the very doors of his chamber, and\nthe Curetes had scaled the walls and were setting fire to the city. Then at last his sorrowing wife detailed the hor-\nrors that befall those whose city is taken; she reminded him how the men are slain, and the city is given over to the\nflames, while the women and children are carried into captivity; when he heard all this, his heart was touched, and\nhe donned his armour to go forth. Thus of his own inward motion he saved the city of the Aetolians; but they now\ngave him nothing of those rich rewards that they had offered earlier, and though he saved the city he took nothing\nby it. Be not then, my son, thus minded; let not heaven lure you into any such course. When the ships are burning it\nwill be a harder matter to save them. Take the gifts, and go, for the Achaeans will then honour you as a god; whereas\nif you fight without taking them, you may beat the battle back, but you will not be held in like honour.\u201d\nAnd Achilles answered, \u201cPhoenix, old friend and father, I have no need of such honour. I have honour from\nJove himself, which will abide with me at my ships while I have breath in my body, and my limbs are strong. I say\nfurther\u2014and lay my saying to your heart\u2014vex me no more with this weeping and lamentation, all in the cause of\nthe son of Atreus. Love him so well, and you may lose the love I bear you. You ought to help me rather in troubling\nthose that trouble me; be king as much as I am, and share like honour with myself; the others shall take my answer;\nstay here yourself and sleep comfortably in your bed; at daybreak we will consider whether to remain or go.\u201d\nOn this she nodded quietly to Patroclus as a sign that he was to prepare a bed for Phoenix, and that the others\nshould take their leave. Ajax son of Telamon then said, \u201cUlysses, noble son of Laertes, let us be gone, for I see that\nour journey is vain. We must now take our answer, unwelcome though it be, to the Danaans who are waiting to\nreceive it. Achilles is savage and remorseless; he is cruel, and cares nothing for the love his comrades lavished upon\nhim more than on all the others. He is implacable \u2014 and yet if a man\u2019s brother or son has been slain he will accept\na fine by way of amends from him that killed him, and the wrong-doer having paid in full remains in peace among\nhis own people; but as for you, Achilles, the gods have put a wicked unforgiving spirit in your heart, and this, all\nabout one single girl, whereas we now offer you the seven best we have, and much else into the bargain. Be then of\na more gracious mind, respect the hospitality of your own roof. We are with you as messengers from the host of the\nDanaans, and would fain he held nearest and dearest to yourself of all the Achaeans.\u201d\n\u201cAjax,\u201d replied Achilles, \u201cnoble son of Telamon, you have spoken much to my liking, but my blood boils when I\n148 The Iliad\nthink it all over, and remember how the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as though I were some vile tramp,\nand that too in the presence of the Argives. Go, then, and deliver your message; say that I will have no concern with\nfighting till Hector, son of noble Priam, reaches the tents of the Myrmidons in his murderous course, and flings fire\nupon their ships. For all his lust of battle, I take it he will be held in check when he is at my own tent and ship.\u201d\nOn this they took every man his double cup, made their drink-offerings, and went back to the ships, Ulysses\nleading the way. But Patroclus told his men and the maid-servants to make ready a comfortable bed for Phoenix;\nthey therefore did so with sheepskins, a rug, and a sheet of fine linen. The old man then laid himself down and wait-\ned till morning came. But Achilles slept in an inner room, and beside him the daughter of Phorbas lovely Diomede,\nwhom he had carried off from Lesbos. Patroclus lay on the other side of the room, and with him fair Iphis whom\nAchilles had given him when he took Scyros the city of Enyeus.\nWhen the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the Achaeans rose, pledged them in cups of gold, and\nbegan to question them. King Agamemnon was the first to do so. Tell me, Ulysses,\u201d said he, \u201cwill he save the ships\nfrom burning, or did be refuse, and is he still furious?\u201d\nUlysses answered, \u201cMost noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, Achilles will not be calmed, but is\nmore fiercely angry than ever, and spurns both you and your gifts. He bids you take counsel with the Achaeans to\nsave the ships and host as you best may; as for himself, he said that at daybreak he should draw his ships into the\nwater. He said further that he should advise every one to sail home likewise, for that you will not reach the goal of\nIlius. \u2018Jove,\u2019 he said, \u2018has laid his hand over the city to protect it, and the people have taken heart.\u2019 This is what he\nsaid, and the others who were with me can tell you the same story\u2014Ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them,\nwho may be trusted. The old man Phoenix stayed where he was to sleep, for so Achilles would have it, that he might\ngo home with him in the morning if he so would; but he will not take him by force.\u201d\nThey all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and dejected, by reason of the sternness with which\nAchilles had refused them, till presently Diomed said, \u201cMost noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, you\nought not to have sued the son of Peleus nor offered him gifts. He is proud enough as it is, and you have encouraged\nhim in his pride am further. Let him stay or go as he will. He will fight later when he is in the humour, and heaven\nputs it in his mind to do so. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; we have eaten and drunk our fill, let us then take\nour rest, for in rest there is both strength and stay. But when fair rosy-fingered morn appears, forthwith bring out\nyour host and your horsemen in front of the ships, urging them on, and yourself fighting among the foremost.\u201d\nThus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. They then made their drink-offerings and went\nevery man to his own tent, where they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.\nBook X\nNOW the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole night through, but Agamemnon son of Atreus\nwas troubled, so that he could get no rest. As when fair Juno\u2019s lord flashes his lightning in token of great rain or\nhail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the ground, or again as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungry\nwar, even so did Agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled within him. When he looked upon\nthe plain of Troy he marvelled at the many watchfires burning in front of Ilius, and at the sound of pipes and flutes\nand of the hum of men, but when presently he turned towards the ships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hair\nby handfuls before Jove on high, and groaned aloud for the very disquietness of his soul. In the end he deemed it\nbest to go at once to Nestor son of Neleus, and see if between them they could find any way of the Achaeans from\ndestruction. He therefore rose, put on his shirt, bound his sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge\ntawny lion over his shoulders\u2014a skin that reached his feet\u2014and took his spear in his hand.\nNeither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argives who for his sake had sailed from far over\nthe seas to fight the Trojans. He covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther, put a casque of bronze\nupon his head, and took his spear in his brawny hand. Then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the most\npowerful of the Achaeans, and was honoured by the people as though he were a god. He found him by the stern of\nhis ship already putting his goodly array about his shoulders, and right glad was he that his brother had come.\nMenelaus spoke first. \u201cWhy,\u201d said he, \u201cmy dear brother, are you thus arming? Are you going to send any of our\ncomrades to exploit the Trojans? I greatly fear that no one will do you this service, and spy upon the enemy alone in\nthe dead of night. It will be a deed of great daring.\u201d\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \u201cMenelaus, we both of us need shrewd counsel to save the Argives and our\nships, for Jove has changed his mind, and inclines towards Hector\u2019s sacrifices rather than ours. I never saw nor\nheard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in one day as Hector has now wrought against the sons of the\nAchaeans\u2014and that too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to god nor goddess. The Argives will rue it\nlong and deeply. Run, therefore, with all speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus. Meanwhile I\nwill go to Nestor, and bid him rise and go about among the companies of our sentinels to give them their instruc-\n149 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ntions; they will listen to him sooner than to any man, for his own son, and Meriones brother in arms to Idomeneus,\nare captains over them. It was to them more particularly that we gave this charge.\u201d\nMenelaus replied, \u201cHow do I take your meaning? Am I to stay with them and wait your coming, or shall I\nreturn here as soon as I have given your orders?\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d answered King Agamemnon, \u201cfor there are so many paths\nabout the camp that we might miss one another. Call every man on your way, and bid him be stirring; name him by\nhis lineage and by his father\u2019s name, give each all titular observance, and stand not too much upon your own digni-\nty; we must take our full share of toil, for at our birth Jove laid this heavy burden upon us.\u201d\nWith these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went on to Nestor shepherd of his people. He found\nhim sleeping in his tent hard by his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him\u2014his shield, his two spears and his\nhelmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdle with which the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his\npeople into battle\u2014for his age stayed him not. He raised himself on his elbow and looked up at Agamemnon. \u201cWho\nis it,\u201d said he, \u201cthat goes thus about the host and the ships alone and in the dead of night, when men are sleeping?\nAre you looking for one of your mules or for some comrade? Do not stand there and say nothing, but speak. What\nis your business?\u201d\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \u201cNestor, son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, it is I, Agamemnon son of\nAtreus, on whom Jove has laid labour and sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and my limbs carry me. I\nam thus abroad because sleep sits not upon my eyelids, but my heart is big with war and with the jeopardy of the\nAchaeans. I am in great fear for the Danaans. I am at sea, and without sure counsel; my heart beats as though it\nwould leap out of my body, and my limbs fail me. If then you can do anything\u2014for you too cannot sleep\u2014let us\ngo the round of the watch, and see whether they are drowsy with toil and sleeping to the neglect of their duty. The\nenemy is encamped hard and we know not but he may attack us by night.\u201d\nNestor replied, \u201cMost noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, Jove will not do all for Hector that Hec-\ntor thinks he will; he will have troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger. I will go with you, and we\nwill rouse others, either the son of Tydeus, or Ulysses, or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Some one had\nalso better go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for their ships are not near at hand but the farthest of all. I cannot\nhowever refrain from blaming Menelaus, much as I love him and respect him\u2014and I will say so plainly, even at the\nrisk of offending you\u2014for sleeping and leaving all this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going about imploring aid\nfrom all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are in extreme danger.\u201d\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \u201cSir, you may sometimes blame him justly, for he is often remiss and unwilling\nto exert himself\u2014not indeed from sloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects me to take\nthe lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before I was, and came to me of his own accord. I have already\nsent him to call the very men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We shall find them with the watch\noutside the gates, for it was there I said that we would meet them.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d answered Nestor, \u201cthe Argives will not blame him nor disobey his orders when he urges them to\nfight or gives them instructions.\u201d\nWith this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his comely feet. He buckled on his purple coat, of\ntwo thicknesses, large, and of a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and wended his\nway along the line of the Achaean ships. First he called loudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him, for\nhe was soon roused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside his tent and said, \u201cWhy do you go thus alone\nabout the host, and along the line of the ships in the stillness of the night? What is it that you find so urgent?\u201d And\nNestor knight of Gerene answered, \u201cUlysses, noble son of Laertes, take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great\nstraits. Come with me and let us wake some other, who may advise well with us whether we shall fight or fly.\u201d\nOn this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about his shoulders and came out with them. First\nthey went to Diomed son of Tydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with his comrades sleep-\ning round him and using their shields as pillows; as for their spears, they stood upright on the spikes of their butts\nthat were driven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed afar like the lightning of father Jove. The hero\nwas sleeping upon the skin of an ox, with a piece of fine carpet under his head; Nestor went up to him and stirred\nhim with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding him and urging him to bestir himself. \u201cWake up,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cson of\nTydeus. How can you sleep on in this way? Can you not see that the Trojans are encamped on the brow of the plain\nhard by our ships, with but a little space between us and them?\u201d\nOn these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, \u201cOld man, your heart is of iron; you rest not one moment\nfrom your labours. Are there no younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse the princes? There\nis no tiring you.\u201d\nAnd Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, \u201cMy son, all that you have said is true. I have good sons, and also\nmuch people who might call the chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger; life and death are balanced\nas it were on the edge of a razor. Go then, for you are younger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajax and the fleet\nson of Phyleus.\u201d\n150 The Iliad\nDiomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders\u2014a skin that reached his feet\u2014and grasped\nhis spear. When he had roused the heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went the round of those who\nwere on guard, and found the captains not sleeping at their posts but wakeful and sitting with their arms about\nthem. As sheep dogs that watch their flocks when they are yarded, and hear a wild beast coming through the moun-\ntain forest towards them\u2014forthwith there is a hue and cry of dogs and men, and slumber is broken\u2014even so was\nsleep chased from the eyes of the Achaeans as they kept the watches of the wicked night, for they turned constantly\ntowards the plain whenever they heard any stir among the Trojans. The old man was glad bade them be of good\ncheer. \u201cWatch on, my children,\u201d said he, \u201cand let not sleep get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph over us.\u201d\nWith this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of the Achaeans who had been called to the coun-\ncil. Meriones and the brave son of Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they were beyond the trench\nthat was dug round the wall they held their meeting on the open ground where there was a space clear of corpses,\nfor it was here that when night fell Hector had turned back from his onslaught on the Argives. They sat down,\ntherefore, and held debate with one another.\nNestor spoke first. \u201cMy friends,\u201d said he, \u201cis there any man bold enough to venture the Trojans, and cut off some\nstraggler, or us news of what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here by the ships away from the city,\nor whether, now that they have worsted the Achaeans, they will retire within their walls. If he could learn all this\nand come back safely here, his fame would be high as heaven in the mouths of all men, and he would be rewarded\nrichly; for the chiefs from all our ships would each of them give him a black ewe with her lamb\u2014which is a present\nof surpassing value\u2014and he would be asked as a guest to all feasts and clan-gatherings.\u201d\nThey all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spoke saying, \u201cNestor, gladly will I visit the host of\nthe Trojans over against us, but if another will go with me I shall do so in greater confidence and comfort. When\ntwo men are together, one of them may see some opportunity which the other has not caught sight of; if a man is\nalone he is less full of resource, and his wit is weaker.\u201d\nOn this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes, servants of Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor\nall wanted to go, so did Menelaus son of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the host of the Trojans, for he was\never full of daring, and thereon Agamemnon king of men spoke thus: \u201cDiomed,\u201d said he, \u201cson of Tydeus, man after\nmy own heart, choose your comrade for yourself\u2014take the best man of those that have offered, for many would\nnow go with you. Do not through delicacy reject the better man, and take the worst out of respect for his lineage,\nbecause he is of more royal blood.\u201d\nHe said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, \u201cIf you bid me take the man of my own choice,\nhow in that case can I fail to think of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to face all kinds of danger\u2014\nand Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he were to go with me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he is quick\nto see and understand.\u201d\n\u201cSon of Tydeus,\u201d replied Ulysses, \u201csay neither good nor ill about me, for you are among Argives who know me\nwell. Let us be going, for the night wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone forward, two-thirds of the night\nare already spent, and the third is alone left us.\u201d\nThey then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son of Tydeus with a sword and a shield (for\nhe had left his own at his ship) and on his head he set a helmet of bull\u2019s hide without either peak or crest; it is called\na skull-cap and is a common headgear. Meriones found a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his head he set a\nleathern helmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leathern thongs, while on the outside it was thickly studded\nwith boar\u2019s teeth, well and skilfully set into it; next the head there was an inner lining of felt. This helmet had been\nstolen by Autolycus out of Eleon when he broke into the house of Amyntor son of Ormenus. He gave it to Am-\nphidamas of Cythera to take to Scandea, and Amphidamas gave it as a guest-gift to Molus, who gave it to his son\nMeriones; and now it was set upon the head of Ulysses.\nWhen the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftains behind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a\nheron by the wayside upon their right hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but they heard its cry. Ulysses\nwas glad when he heard it and prayed to Minerva: \u201cHear me,\u201d he cried, \u201cdaughter of aegis-bearing Jove, you who\nspy out all my ways and who are with me in all my hardships; befriend me in this mine hour, and grant that we\nmay return to the ships covered with glory after having achieved some mighty exploit that shall bring sorrow to the\nTrojans.\u201d\nThen Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: \u201cHear me too,\u201d said he, \u201cdaughter of Jove, unweariable; be with\nme even as you were with my noble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by the Achaeans. He left\nthe Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopus, and went to the city bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeians;\non his return thence, with your help, goddess, he did great deeds of daring, for you were his ready helper. Even so\nguide me and guard me now, and in return I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbro-\nken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild her horns and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.\u201d\nThus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When they had done praying to the daughter of great\n151 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nJove, they went their way like two lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stained bodies of them that\nhad fallen.\nNeither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too called the princes and councillors of the Trojans that\nhe might set his counsel before them. \u201cIs there one,\u201d said he, \u201cwho for a great reward will do me the service of which\nI will tell you? He shall be well paid if he will. I will give him a chariot and a couple of horses, the fleetest that can\nbe found at the ships of the Achaeans, if he will dare this thing; and he will win infinite honour to boot; he must go\nto the ships and find out whether they are still guarded as heretofore, or whether now that we have beaten them the\nAchaeans design to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their watches.\u201d\nThey all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certain man named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the\nfamous herald\u2014a man rich in gold and bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an only son among\nfive sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans. \u201cI, Hector,\u201d said he, \u201cWill to the ships and will exploit them.\nBut first hold up your sceptre and swear that you will give me the chariot, bedight with bronze, and the horses that\nnow carry the noble son of Peleus. I will make you a good scout, and will not fail you. I will go through the host\nfrom one end to the other till I come to the ship of Agamemnon, where I take it the princes of the Achaeans are\nnow consulting whether they shall fight or fly.\u201d\nWhen he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and swore him his oath saying, \u201cMay Jove the thunder-\ning husband of Juno bear witness that no other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds, and that you shall have\nyour will with them for ever.\u201d\nThe oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on going. He hung his bow over his shoul-\nder, and as an overall he wore the skin of a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferret skin. Then he took a\npointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships, but he was not to return with any news for Hector. When he had left\nthe horses and the troops behind him, he made all speed on his way, but Ulysses perceived his coming and said to\nDiomed, \u201cDiomed, here is some one from the camp; I am not sure whether he is a spy, or whether it is some thief\nwho would plunder the bodies of the dead; let him get a little past us, we can then spring upon him and take him.\nIf, however, he is too quick for us, go after him with your spear and hem him in towards the ships away from the\nTrojan camp, to prevent his getting back to the town.\u201d\nWith this they turned out of their way and lay down among the corpses. Dolon suspected nothing and soon\npassed them, but when he had got about as far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds one that has\nbeen ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow land quicker than oxen) they ran after him, and when he heard\ntheir footsteps he stood still, for he made sure they were friends from the Trojan camp come by Hector\u2019s orders to\nbid him return; when, however, they were only a spear\u2019s cast, or less away form him, he saw that they were ene-\nmies as fast as his legs could take him. The others gave chase at once, and as a couple of well-trained hounds press\nforward after a doe or hare that runs screaming in front of them, even so did the son of Tydeus and Ulysses pursue\nDolon and cut him off from his own people. But when he had fled so far towards the ships that he would soon have\nfallen in with the outposts, Minerva infused fresh strength into the son of Tydeus for fear some other of the Achae-\nans might have the glory of being first to hit him, and he might himself be only second; he therefore sprang forward\nwith his spear and said, \u201cStand, or I shall throw my spear, and in that case I shall soon make an end of you.\u201d\nHe threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flew over the man\u2019s right shoulder, and then\nstuck in the ground. He stood stock still, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered, and he turned pale with\nfear. The two came breathless up to him and seized his hands, whereon he began to weep and said, \u201cTake me alive;\nI will ransom myself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this my father will satisfy you\nwith a very large ransom, should he hear of my being alive at the ships of the Achaeans.\u201d\n\u201cFear not,\u201d replied Ulysses, \u201clet no thought of death be in your mind; but tell me, and tell me true, why are you\nthus going about alone in the dead of night away from your camp and towards the ships, while other men are sleep-\ning? Is it to plunder the bodies of the slain, or did Hector send you to spy out what was going on at the ships? Or\ndid you come here of your own mere notion?\u201d\nDolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: \u201cHector, with his vain flattering promises, lured me from\nmy better judgement. He said he would give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus and his bronze-bedizened\nchariot; he bade me go through the darkness of the flying night, get close to the enemy, and find out whether the\nships are still guarded as heretofore, or whether, now that we have beaten them, the Achaeans design to fly, and\nthrough sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their watches.\u201d\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, \u201cYou had indeed set your heart upon a great reward, but the horses of the\ndescendant of Aeacus are hardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than Achilles himself, whose\nmother was an immortal. But tell me, and tell me true, where did you leave Hector when you started? Where lies\nhis armour and his horses? How, too, are the watches and sleeping-ground of the Trojans ordered? What are their\nplans? Will they stay here by the ships and away from the city, or now that they have worsted the Achaeans, will\nthey retire within their walls?\u201d\n152 The Iliad\nAnd Dolon answered, \u201cI will tell you truly all. Hector and the other councillors are now holding conference by\nthe monument of great Ilus, away from the general tumult; as for the guards about which you ask me, there is no\nchosen watch to keep guard over the host. The Trojans have their watchfires, for they are bound to have them; they,\ntherefore, are awake and keep each other to their duty as sentinels; but the allies who have come from other places\nare asleep and leave it to the Trojans to keep guard, for their wives and children are not here.\u201d\nUlysses then said, \u201cNow tell me; are they sleeping among the Trojan troops, or do they lie apart? Explain this\nthat I may understand it.\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you truly all,\u201d replied Dolon. \u201cTo the seaward lie the Carians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the\nCauconians, and the noble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians and Meonians, have their\nplace on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask about an this? If you want to find your way into the host of the\nTrojans, there are the Thracians, who have lately come here and lie apart from the others at the far end of the camp;\nand they have Rhesus son of Eioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and strongest that I have ever seen,\nthey are whiter than snow and fleeter than any wind that blows. His chariot is bedight with silver and gold, and he\nhas brought his marvellous golden armour, of the rarest workmanship\u2014too splendid for any mortal man to carry,\nand meet only for the gods. Now, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securely here, until you come back and\nhave proved my words whether they be false or true.\u201d\nDiomed looked sternly at him and answered, \u201cThink not, Dolon, for all the good information you have given\nus, that you shall escape now you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you will come some second\ntime to the ships of the Achaeans either as a spy or as an open enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you will\ngive no more trouble.\u201d\nOn this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech him further, but Diomed struck him in the mid-\ndle of his neck with his sword and cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in the dust while he was yet\nspeaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from his head, and also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Ulysses\nhung them up aloft in honour of Minerva the goddess of plunder, and prayed saying, \u201cAccept these, goddess, for we\ngive them to you in preference to all the gods in Olympus: therefore speed us still further towards the horses and\nsleeping-ground of the Thracians.\u201d\nWith these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk tree, and they marked the place by pulling\nup reeds and gathering boughs of tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through the\u2019 flying hours\nof darkness. The two then went onwards amid the fallen armour and the blood, and came presently to the company\nof Thracian soldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with their day\u2019s toil; their goodly armour was lying on the ground\nbeside them all orderly in three rows, and each man had his yoke of horses beside him. Rhesus was sleeping in the\nmiddle, and hard by him his horses were made fast to the topmost rim of his chariot. Ulysses from some way off\nsaw him and said, \u201cThis, Diomed, is the man, and these are the horses about which Dolon whom we killed told us.\nDo your very utmost; dally not about your armour, but loose the horses at once\u2014or else kill the men yourself, while\nI see to the horses.\u201d\nThereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smote them right and left. They made a hid-\neous groaning as they were being hacked about, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lion springs furiously\nupon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds without their shepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thracian\nsoldiers till he had killed twelve. As he killed them Ulysses came and drew them aside by their feet one by one, that\nthe horses might go forward freely without being frightened as they passed over the dead bodies, for they were not\nyet used to them. When the son of Tydeus came to the king, he killed him too (which made thirteen), as he was\nbreathing hard, for by the counsel of Minerva an evil dream, the seed of Oeneus, hovered that night over his head.\nMeanwhile Ulysses untied the horses, made them fast one to another and drove them off, striking them with his\nbow, for he had forgotten to take the whip from the chariot. Then he whistled as a sign to Diomed.\nBut Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed he might accomplish. He was doubting\nwhether to take the chariot in which the king\u2019s armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to lift the armour\nout and carry it off; or whether again, he should not kill some more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Miner-\nva came up to him and said, \u201cGet back, Diomed, to the ships or you may be driven thither, should some other god\nrouse the Trojans.\u201d\nDiomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the horses. Ulysses beat them with his bow and\nthey flew onward to the ships of the Achaeans.\nBut Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the son of Tydeus. He was angry with her, and\ncoming to the host of the Trojans he roused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noble kinsman of\nRhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that the horses were no longer in their place, and that the men were\ngasping in their death-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his friend by name. Then the whole Trojan\ncamp was in an uproar as the people kept hurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds of the heroes who had\nnow got away towards the ships.\n153 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nWhen they reached the place where they had killed Hector\u2019s scout, Ulysses stayed his horses, and the son of\nTydeus, leaping to the ground, placed the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses and remounted: then he\nlashed the horses onwards, and they flew forward nothing loth towards the ships as though of their own free will.\nNestor was first to hear the tramp of their feet. \u201cMy friends,\u201d said he, \u201cprinces and counsellors of the Argives, shall\nI guess right or wrong?\u2014but I must say what I think: there is a sound in my ears as of the tramp of horses. I hope\nit may Diomed and Ulysses driving in horses from the Trojans, but I much fear that the bravest of the Argives may\nhave come to some harm at their hands.\u201d\nHe had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted, whereon the others shook hands\nright gladly with them and congratulated them. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to question them. \u201cTell me,\u201d said\nhe, \u201crenowned Ulysses, how did you two come by these horses? Did you steal in among the Trojan forces, or did\nsome god meet you and give them to you? They are like sunbeams. I am well conversant with the Trojans, for old\nwarrior though I am I never hold back by the ships, but I never yet saw or heard of such horses as these are. Surely\nsome god must have met you and given them to you, for you are both of dear to Jove, and to Jove\u2019s daughter Miner-\nva.\u201d\nAnd Ulysses answered, \u201cNestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, heaven, if it so will, can give us\neven better horses than these, for the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses, however, about which you ask\nme, are freshly come from Thrace. Diomed killed their king with the twelve bravest of his companions. Hard by the\nships we took a thirteenth man\u2014a scout whom Hector and the other Trojans had sent as a spy upon our ships.\u201d\nHe laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while the other Achaeans followed him gladly.\nWhen they reached the strongly built quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses with thongs of leather to\nthe manger, where the steeds of Diomed stood eating their sweet corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoils\nof Dolon at the stern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred offering to Minerva. As for themselves, they went\ninto the sea and washed the sweat from their bodies, and from their necks and thighs. When the sea-water had tak-\nen all the sweat from off them, and had refreshed them, they went into the baths and washed themselves. After they\nhad so done and had anointed themselves with oil, they sat down to table, and drawing from a full mixing-bowl,\nmade a drink-offering of wine to Minerva.\nBook XI\nAND now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger of light alike to mortals and immortals,\nJove sent fierce Discord with the ensign of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans. She took her stand by the\nhuge black hull of Ulysses\u2019 ship which was middlemost of all, so that her voice might carry farthest on either side,\non the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other towards those of Achilles\u2014for these\ntwo heroes, well-assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the two ends of the line.\nThere she took her stand, and raised a cry both loud and shrill that filled the Achaeans with courage, giving them\nheart to fight resolutely and with all their might, so that they had rather stay there and do battle than go home in\ntheir ships.\nThe son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird themselves for battle while he put on his armour.\nFirst he girded his goodly greaves about his legs, making them fast with ankle clasps of silver; and about his chest\nhe set the breastplate which Cinyras had once given him as a guest-gift. It had been noised abroad as far as Cyprus\nthat the Achaeans were about to sail for Troy, and therefore he gave it to the king. It had ten courses of dark cyanus,\ntwelve of gold, and ten of tin. There were serpents of cyanus that reared themselves up towards the neck, three upon\neither side, like the rainbows which the son of Saturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortal men. About his shoulders\nhe threw his sword, studded with bosses of gold; and the scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold wherewith to\nhang it. He took moreover the richly-dight shield that covered his body when he was in battle\u2014fair to see, with ten\ncircles of bronze running all round see, wit it. On the body of the shield there were twenty bosses of white tin, with\nanother of dark cyanus in the middle: this last was made to show a Gorgon\u2019s head, fierce and grim, with Rout and\nPanic on either side. The band for the arm to go through was of silver, on which there was a writhing snake of cy-\nanus with three heads that sprang from a single neck, and went in and out among one another. On his head Agam-\nemnon set a helmet, with a peak before and behind, and four plumes of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above\nit; then he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears, and the gleam of his armour shot from him as a flame into\nthe firmament, while Juno and Minerva thundered in honour of the king of rich Mycene.\nEvery man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold them in readiness by the trench, while he went\ninto battle on foot clad in full armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into the dawning. The chiefs were armed\nand at the trench before the horses got there, but these came up presently. The son of Saturn sent a portent of evil\nsound about their host, and the dew fell red with blood, for he was about to send many a brave man hurrying down\nto Hades.\n154 The Iliad\nThe Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain, were gathered round great Hector, noble Poly-\ndamas, Aeneas who was honoured by the Trojans like an immortal, and the three sons of Antenor, Polybus, Agenor,\nand young Acamas beauteous as a god. Hector\u2019s round shield showed in the front rank, and as some baneful star\nthat shines for a moment through a rent in the clouds and is again hidden beneath them; even so was Hector now\nseen in the front ranks and now again in the hindermost, and his bronze armour gleamed like the lightning of\naegis-bearing Jove.\nAnd now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon a rich man\u2019s land, and the sheaves fall thick\nbefore them, even so did the Trojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no mood for yielding but\nfought like wolves, and neither side got the better of the other. Discord was glad as she beheld them, for she was the\nonly god that went among them; the others were not there, but stayed quietly each in his own home among the dells\nand valleys of Olympus. All of them blamed the son of Saturn for wanting to Live victory to the Trojans, but father\nJove heeded them not: he held aloof from all, and sat apart in his all-glorious majesty, looking down upon the city\nof the Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam of bronze, and alike upon the slayers and on the slain.\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their darts rained thick on one another and the people\nperished, but as the hour drew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest will get his midday meal\u2014\nfor he has felled till his hands are weary; he is tired out, and must now have food\u2014then the Danaans with a cry that\nrang through all their ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy. Agamemnon led them on, and slew first Bienor, a\nleader of his people, and afterwards his comrade and charioteer Oileus, who sprang from his chariot and was com-\ning full towards him; but Agamemnon struck him on the forehead with his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail\nagainst the weapon, which pierced both bronze and bone, so that his brains were battered in and he was killed in\nfull fight.\nAgamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with their breasts all bare to lie where they had\nfallen. He then went on to kill Isus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, the other born in wedlock;\nthey were in the same chariot\u2014the bastard driving, while noble Antiphus fought beside him. Achilles had once tak-\nen both of them prisoners in the glades of Ida, and had bound them with fresh withes as they were shepherding, but\nhe had taken a ransom for them; now, however, Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus in the chest above the nipple\nwith his spear, while he struck Antiphus hard by the ear and threw him from his chariot. Forthwith he stripped\ntheir goodly armour from off them and recognized them, for he had already seen them at ships when Achilles\nbrought them in from Ida. As a lion fastens on the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his great jaws, robbing them\nof their tender life while he on his way back to his lair\u2014the hind can do nothing for them even though she be close\nby, for she is in an agony of fear, and flies through the thick forest, sweating, and at her utmost speed before the\nmighty monster\u2014so, no man of the Trojans could help Isus and Antiphus, for they were themselves flying panic\nbefore the Argives.\nThen King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander and brave Hippolochus. It was Antimachus\nwho had been foremost in preventing Helen\u2019s being restored to Menelaus, for he was largely bribed by Alexandrus;\nand now Agamemnon took his two sons, both in the same chariot, trying to bring their horses to a stand\u2014for they\nhad lost hold of the reins and the horses were mad with fear. The son of Atreus sprang upon them like a lion, and\nthe pair besought him from their chariot. \u201cTake us alive,\u201d they cried, \u201cson of Atreus, and you shall receive a great\nransom for us. Our father Antimachus has great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this he will satis-\nfy you with a very large ransom should he hear of our being alive at the ships of the Achaeans.\u201d\nWith such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but they heard no pitiful answer in return. \u201cIf,\u201d\nsaid Agamemnon, \u201cyou are sons of Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans proposed that Menelaus and\nUlysses, who had come to you as envoys, should be killed and not suffered to return, you shall now pay for the foul\niniquity of your father.\u201d\nAs he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth, smiting him on the chest with his spear, so that he\nlay face uppermost upon the ground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did Agamemnon smite; he cut off his hands\nand his head\u2014which he sent rolling in among the crowd as though it were a ball. There he let them both lie, and\nwherever the ranks were thickest thither he flew, while the other Achaeans followed. Foot soldiers drove the foot\nsoldiers of the foe in rout before them, and slew them; horsemen did the like by horsemen, and the thundering\ntramp of the horses raised a cloud of dust frim off the plain. King Agamemnon followed after, ever slaying them and\ncheering on the Achaeans. As when some mighty forest is all ablaze\u2014the eddying gusts whirl fire in all directions\ntill the thickets shrivel and are consumed before the blast of the flame\u2014even so fell the heads of the flying Trojans\nbefore Agamemnon son of Atreus, and many a noble pair of steeds drew an empty chariot along the highways of\nwar, for lack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more useful now to vultures than to their wives.\nJove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage and din of battle; but the son of Atreus sped\nonwards, calling out lustily to the Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus, son of Dardanus, in the middle\nof the plain, and past the place of the wild fig-tree making always for the city\u2014the son of Atreus still shouting, and\n155 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nwith hands all bedrabbled in gore; but when they had reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, there they halted\nand waited for the others to come up. Meanwhile the Trojans kept on flying over the middle of the plain like a herd\ncows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them in the dead of night\u2014he springs on one of them, seizes\nher neck in the grip of his strong teeth and then laps up her blood and gorges himself upon her entrails\u2014even so\ndid King Agamemnon son of Atreus pursue the foe, ever slaughtering the hindmost as they fled pell-mell before\nhim. Many a man was flung headlong from his chariot by the hand of the son of Atreus, for he wielded his spear\nwith fury.\nBut when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city, the father of gods and men came down from\nheaven and took his seat, thunderbolt in hand, upon the crest of many-fountained Ida. He then told Iris of the gold-\nen wings to carry a message for him. \u201cGo,\u201d said he, \u201cfleet Iris, and speak thus to Hector\u2014say that so long as he sees\nAgamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, he is to keep aloof and bid the others bear the\nbrunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then will I\nvouchsafe him strength to slay till he reach the ships and night falls at the going down of the sun.\u201d\nIris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from the crests of Ida, and found Hector son of\nPriam standing by his chariot and horses. Then she said, \u201cHector son of Priam, peer of gods in counsel, father Jove\nhas sent me to bear you this message\u2014so long as you see Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the\nTrojan ranks, you are to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon is wound-\ned either by spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then will Jove vouchsafe you strength to slay till you reach the\nships, and till night falls at the going down of the sun.\u201d\nWhen she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full armed from his chariot to the ground, bran-\ndishing his spear as he went about everywhere among the host, cheering his men on to fight, and stirring the dread\nstrife of battle. The Trojans then wheeled round, and again met the Achaeans, while the Argives on their part\nstrengthened their battalions. The battle was now in array and they stood face to face with one another, Agamem-\nnon ever pressing forward in his eagerness to be ahead of all others.\nTell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who, whether of the Trojans or of their allies,\nwas first to face Agamemnon? It was Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and of great stature, who was\nbrought up in fertile Thrace the mother of sheep. Cisses, his mother\u2019s father, brought him up in his own house when\nhe was a child\u2014Cisses, father to fair Theano. When he reached manhood, Cisses would have kept him there, and\nwas for giving him his daughter in marriage, but as soon as he had married he set out to fight the Achaeans with\ntwelve ships that followed him: these he had left at Percote and had come on by land to Ilius. He it was that naw\nmet Agamemnon son of Atreus. When they were close up with one another, the son of Atreus missed his aim, and\nIphidamas hit him on the girdle below the cuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting to his strength of\narm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor nearly so, for the point of the spear struck against the silver and was\nturned aside as though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught it from his hand, and drew it towards him with\nthe fury of a lion; he then drew his sword, and killed Iphidamas by striking him on the neck. So there the poor fel-\nlow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were of bronze, killed in the defence of his fellow-citizens, far from his wedded wife, of\nwhom he had had no joy though he had given much for her: he had given a hundred-head of cattle down, and had\npromised later on to give a thousand sheep and goats mixed, from the countless flocks of which he was possessed.\nAgamemnon son of Atreus then despoiled him, and carried off his armour into the host of the Achaeans.\nWhen noble Coon, Antenor\u2019s eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were his eyes at the sight of his fallen brother.\nUnseen by Agamemnon he got beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle of his arm below the\nelbow, the point of the spear going right through the arm. Agamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not even\nfor this did he leave off struggling and fighting, but grasped his spear that flew as fleet as the wind, and sprang upon\nCoon who was trying to drag off the body of his brother\u2014his father\u2019s son\u2014by the foot, and was crying for help to\nall the bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnon struck him with a bronze-shod spear and killed him as he was\ndragging the dead body through the press of men under cover of his shield: he then cut off his head, standing over\nthe body of Iphidamas. Thus did the sons of Antenor meet their fate at the hands of the son of Atreus, and go down\ninto the house of Hades.\nAs long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon went about attacking the ranks of the\nenemy with spear and sword and with great handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased to flow and the\nwound grew dry, the pain became great. As the sharp pangs which the Eilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth, daughters\nof Juno and dispensers of cruel pain, send upon a woman when she is in labour\u2014even so sharp were the pangs of\nthe son of Atreus. He sprang on to his chariot, and bade his charioteer drive to the ships, for he was in great agony.\nWith a loud clear voice he shouted to the Danaans, \u201cMy friends, princes and counsellors of the Argives, defend the\nships yourselves, for Jove has not suffered me to fight the whole day through against the Trojans.\u201d\nWith this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and they flew forward nothing loth. Their chests\nwere white with foam and their bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of the battle.\n156 The Iliad\nWhen Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying, \u201cTrojans, Lycians,\nand Dardanian warriors, be men, my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; their best man has left them,\nand Jove has vouchsafed me a great triumph; charge the foe with your chariots that. you may win still greater glory.\u201d\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a huntsman hounds his dogs on against a lion\nor wild boar, even so did Hector, peer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the Achaeans. Full of hope he\nplunged in among the foremost, and fell on the fight like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and\nlashes its deep blue waters into fury.\nWhat, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killed in the hour of triumph which Jove then\nvouchsafed him? First Asaeus, Autonous, and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius, Opheltius and Agelaus; Aesymnus,\nOrus and Hipponous steadfast in battle; these chieftains of the Achaeans did Hector slay, and then he fell upon the\nrank and file. As when the west wind hustles the clouds of the white south and beats them down with the fierceness\nof its fury\u2014the waves of the sea roll high, and the spray is flung aloft in the rage of the wandering wind\u2014even so\nthick were the heads of them that fell by the hand of Hector.\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans would have fled pell-mell to their ships, had not\nUlysses cried out to Diomed, \u201cSon of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus forget our prowess? Come, my\ngood fellow, stand by my side and help me, we shall be shamed for ever if Hector takes the ships.\u201d\nAnd Diomed answered, \u201cCome what may, I will stand firm; but we shall have scant joy of it, for Jove is minded\nto give victory to the Trojans rather than to us.\u201d\nWith these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to the ground, smiting him in the left breast with his\nspear, while Ulysses killed Molion who was his squire. These they let lie, now that they had stopped their fighting;\nthe two heroes then went on playing havoc with the foe, like two wild boars that turn in fury and rend the hounds\nthat hunt them. Thus did they turn upon the Trojans and slay them, and the Achaeans were thankful to have\nbreathing time in their flight from Hector.\nThey then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of Merops of Percote, who excelled all others in the\narts of divination. He had forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they would not obey him, for fate lured them to\ntheir fall. Diomed son of Tydeus slew them both and stripped them of their armour, while Ulysses killed Hippoda-\nmus and Hypeirochus.\nAnd now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained that neither side should have the advantage,\nand they kept on killing one another. The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of Paeon in the hip-joint with his\nspear. His chariot was not at hand for him to fly with, so blindly confident had he been. His squire was in charge of\nit at some distance and he was fighting on foot among the foremost until he lost his life. Hector soon marked the\nhavoc Diomed and Ulysses were making, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followed by the Trojan ranks;\nbrave Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and said to Ulysses who was beside him, \u201cGreat Hector is bearing\ndown upon us and we shall be undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.\u201d\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss his mark. He had aimed at Hector\u2019s head near\nthe top of his helmet, but bronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was untouched, for the spear was stayed by the\nvisored helm made with three plates of metal, which Phoebus Apollo had given him. Hector sprang back with a\ngreat bound under cover of the ranks; he fell on his knees and propped himself with his brawny hand leaning on\nthe ground, for darkness had fallen on his eyes. The son of Tydeus having thrown his spear dashed in among the\nforemost fighters, to the place where he had seen it strike the ground; meanwhile Hector recovered himself and\nspringing back into his chariot mingled with the crowd, by which means he saved his life. But Diomed made at him\nwith his spear and said, \u201cDog, you have again got away though death was close on your heels. Phoebus Apollo, to\nwhom I ween you pray ere you go into battle, has again saved you, nevertheless I will meet you and make and end\nof you hereafter, if there is any god who will stand by me too and be my helper. For the present I must pursue those\nI can lay hands on.\u201d\nAs he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon, but Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen\naimed an arrow at him, leaning against a pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilus son of Dardanus, a\nruler in days of old. Diomed had taken the cuirass from off the breast of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet also, and\nthe shield from off his shoulders, when Paris drew his bow and let fly an arrow that sped not from his hand in vain,\nbut pierced the flat of Diomed\u2019s right foot, going right through it and fixing itself in the ground. Thereon Paris with\na hearty laugh sprang forward from his hiding-place, and taunted him saying, \u201cYou are wounded\u2014my arrow has\nnot been shot in vain; would that it had hit you in the belly and killed you, for thus the Trojans, who fear you as\ngoats fear a lion, would have had a truce from evil.\u201d\nDiomed all undaunted answered, \u201cArcher, you who without your bow are nothing, slanderer and seducer, if\nyou were to be tried in single combat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows would serve you in little\nstead. Vain is your boast in that you have scratched the sole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some silly\nboy had hit me. A worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when I wound a man though I but graze his skin\n157 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nit is another matter, for my weapon will lay him low. His wife will tear her cheeks for grief and his children will be\nfatherless: there will he rot, reddening the earth with his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather round him.\u201d\nThus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under this cover he sat down to draw the arrow from\nhis foot, and sharp was the pain he suffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his chariot and bade the charioteer\ndrive him to the ships, for he was sick at heart.\nUlysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for they were all panic-stricken. \u201cAlas,\u201d said he to\nhimself in his dismay, \u201cwhat will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly before these odds, but it will be worse if I\nam left alone and taken prisoner, for the son of Saturn has struck the rest of the Danaans with panic. But why talk\nto myself in this way? Well do I know that though cowards quit the field, a hero, whether he wound or be wounded,\nmust stand firm and hold his own.\u201d\nWhile he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advanced and hemmed him in, and bitterly did they\ncome to me it. As hounds and lusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from his lair whetting his white tusks\u2014\nthey attack him from every side and can hear the gnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness they still hold\ntheir ground\u2014even so furiously did the Trojans attack Ulysses. First he sprang spear in hand upon Deiopites and\nwounded him on the shoulder with a downward blow; then he killed Thoon and Ennomus. After these he struck\nChersidamas in the loins under his shield as he had just sprung down from his chariot; so he fell in the dust and\nclutched the earth in the hollow of his hand. These he let lie, and went on to wound Charops son of Hippasus own\nbrother to noble Socus. Socus, hero that he was, made all speed to help him, and when he was close to Ulysses he\nsaid, \u201cFar-famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil, this day you shall either boast of having killed both the sons of\nHippasus and stripped them of their armour, or you shall fall before my spear.\u201d\nWith these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear went through the shield and passed on through his\nrichly wrought cuirass, tearing the flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did not suffer it to pierce the entrails of\nthe hero. Ulysses knew that his hour was not yet come, but he gave ground and said to Socus, \u201cWretch, you shall\nnow surely die. You have stayed me from fighting further with the Trojans, but you shall now fall by my spear, yield-\ning glory to myself, and your soul to Hades of the noble steeds.\u201d\nSocus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck him in the back midway between the shoulders,\nand went right through his chest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses vaunted over him saying, \u201cO Socus,\nson of Hippasus tamer of horses, death has been too quick for you and you have not escaped him: poor wretch, not\neven in death shall your father and mother close your eyes, but the ravening vultures shall enshroud you with the\nflapping of their dark wings and devour you. Whereas even though I fall the Achaeans will give me my due rites of\nburial.\u201d\nSo saying he drew Socus\u2019s heavy spear out of his flesh and from his shield, and the blood welled forth when the\nspear was withdrawn so that he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Ulysses was bleeding they raised\na great shout and came on in a body towards him; he therefore gave ground, and called his comrades to come and\nhelp him. Thrice did he cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice did brave Menelaus hear him; he turned, therefore,\nto Ajax who was close beside him and said, \u201cAjax, noble son of Telamon, captain of your people, the cry of Ulysses\nrings in my ears, as though the Trojans had cut him off and were worsting him while he is single-handed. Let us\nmake our way through the throng; it will be well that we defend him; I fear he may come to harm for all his valour\nif he be left without support, and the Danaans would miss him sorely.\u201d\nHe led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans had gathered round Ulysses like ravenous moun-\ntain jackals round the carcase of some homed stag that has been hit with an arrow\u2014the stag has fled at full speed so\nlong as his blood was warm and his strength has lasted, but when the arrow has overcome him, the savage jackals\ndevour him in the shady glades of the forest. Then heaven sends a fierce lion thither, whereon the jackals fly in\nterror and the lion robs them of their prey\u2014even so did Trojans many and brave gather round crafty Ulysses, but\nthe hero stood at bay and kept them off with his spear. Ajax then came up with his shield before him like a wall,\nand stood hard by, whereon the Trojans fled in all directions. Menelaus took Ulysses by the hand, and led him out\nof the press while his squire brought up his chariot, but Ajax rushed furiously on the Trojans and killed Doryclus, a\nbastard son of Priam; then he wounded Pandocus, Lysandrus, Pyrasus, and Pylartes; as some swollen torrent comes\nrushing in full flood from the mountains on to the plain, big with the rain of heaven\u2014many a dry oak and many a\npine does it engulf, and much mud does it bring down and cast into the sea\u2014even so did brave Ajax chase the foe\nfuriously over the plain, slaying both men and horses.\nHector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fighting on the extreme left of the battle by the banks\nof the river Scamander, where the carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest round Nestor and brave Idome-\nneus. Among these Hector was making great slaughter with his spear and furious driving, and was destroying the\nranks that were opposed to him; still the Achaeans would have given no ground, had not Alexandrus husband of\nlovely Helen stayed the prowess of Machaon shepherd of his people, by wounding him in the right shoulder with\na triple-barbed arrow. The Achaeans were in great fear that as the fight had turned against them the Trojans might\n158 The Iliad\ntake him prisoner, and Idomeneus said to Nestor, \u201cNestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, mount your\nchariot at once; take Machaon with you and drive your horses to the ships as fast as you can. A physician is worth\nmore than several other men put together, for he can cut out arrows and spread healing herbs.\u201d\nNestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he at once mounted his chariot, and Machaon son\nof the famed physician Aesculapius went with him. He lashed his horses and they flew onward nothing loth towards\nthe ships, as though of their own free will.\nThen Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector from his place beside him, \u201cHector, here are we\ntwo fighting on the extreme wing of the battle, while the other Trojans are in pell-mell rout, they and their horses.\nAjax son of Telamon is driving them before him; I know him by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our chariot\nand horses thither, where horse and foot are fighting most desperately, and where the cry of battle is loudest.\u201d\nWith this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the whip they drew the chariot full speed among the\nAchaeans and Trojans, over the bodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle was bespattered with blood,\nand the rail round the car was covered with splashes both from the horses\u2019 hoofs and from the tyres of the wheels.\nHector tore his way through and flung himself into the thick of the fight, and his presence threw the Danaans into\nconfusion, for his spear was not long idle; nevertheless though he went among the ranks with sword and spear, and\nthrowing great stones, he avoided Ajax son of Telamon, for Jove would have been angry with him if he had fought a\nbetter man than himself.\nThen father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart of Ajax, so that he stood there dazed and threw\nhis shield behind him\u2014looking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were some wild beast, and turning\nhither and thither but crouching slowly backwards. As peasants with their hounds chase a lion from their stock-\nyard, and watch by night to prevent his carrying off the pick of their herd\u2014he makes his greedy spring, but in vain,\nfor the darts from many a strong hand fall thick around him, with burning brands that scare him for all his fury,\nand when morning comes he slinks foiled and angry away\u2014even so did Ajax, sorely against his will, retreat angrily\nbefore the Trojans, fearing for the ships of the Achaeans. Or as some lazy ass that has had many a cudgel broken\nabout his back, when he into a field begins eating the corn\u2014boys beat him but he is too many for them, and though\nthey lay about with their sticks they cannot hurt him; still when he has had his fill they at last drive him from the\nfield\u2014even so did the Trojans and their allies pursue great Ajax, ever smiting the middle of his shield with their\ndarts. Now and again he would turn and show fight, keeping back the battalions of the Trojans, and then he would\nagain retreat; but he prevented any of them from making his way to the ships. Single-handed he stood midway\nbetween the Trojans and Achaeans: the spears that sped from their hands stuck some of them in his mighty shield,\nwhile many, though thirsting for his blood, fell to the ground ere they could reach him to the wounding of his fair\nflesh.\nNow when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax was being overpowered by the rain of arrows,\nhe went up to him and hurled his spear. He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver below the midriff, and laid\nhim low. Eurypylus sprang upon him, and stripped the armour from his shoulders; but when Alexandrus saw him,\nhe aimed an arrow at him which struck him in the right thigh; the arrow broke, but the point that was left in the\nwound dragged on the thigh; he drew back, therefore, under cover of his comrades to save his life, shouting as he\ndid so to the Danaans, \u201cMy friends, princes and counsellors of the Argives, rally to the defence of Ajax who is being\noverpowered, and I doubt whether he will come out of the fight alive. Hither, then, to the rescue of great Ajax son of\nTelamon.\u201d\nEven so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came near, and gathered round him, holding\ntheir shields upwards from their shoulders so as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards them, and turned\nround to stand at bay as soon as he had reached his men.\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the mares of Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were\nbearing Nestor out of the fight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people. Achilles saw and took note, for he\nwas standing on the stern of his ship watching the hard stress and struggle of the fight. He called from the ship to\nhis comrade Patroclus, who heard him in the tent and came out looking like Mars himself\u2014here indeed was the\nbeginning of the ill that presently befell him. \u201cWhy,\u201d said he, \u201cAchilles do you call me? what do you what do you\nwant with me?\u201d And Achilles answered, \u201cNoble son of Menoetius, man after my own heart, I take it that I shall now\nhave the Achaeans praying at my knees, for they are in great straits; go, Patroclus, and ask Nestor who is that he is\nbearing away wounded from the field; from his back I should say it was Machaon son of Aesculapius, but I could\nnot see his face for the horses went by me at full speed.\u201d\nPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off running by the ships and tents of the Achaeans.\nWhen Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son of Neleus, they dismounted, and an esquire, Eu-\nrymedon, took the horses from the chariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the seaside to dry the sweat from\ntheir shirts, and when they had so done they came inside and took their seats. Fair Hecamede, whom Nestor had\nhad awarded to him from Tenedos when Achilles took it, mixed them a mess; she was daughter of wise Arsinous,\n159 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nand the Achaeans had given her to Nestor because he excelled all of them in counsel. First she set for them a fair\nand well-made table that had feet of cyanus; on it there was a vessel of bronze and an onion to give relish to the\ndrink, with honey and cakes of barley-meal. There was also a cup of rare workmanship which the old man had\nbrought with him from home, studded with bosses of gold; it had four handles, on each of which there were two\ngolden doves feeding, and it had two feet to stand on. Any one else would hardly have been able to lift it from the\ntable when it was full, but Nestor could do so quite easily. In this the woman, as fair as a goddess, mixed them a\nmess with Pramnian wine; she grated goat\u2019s milk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in a handful of white\nbarley-meal, and having thus prepared the mess she bade them drink it. When they had done so and had thus\nquenched their thirst, they fell talking with one another, and at this moment Patroclus appeared at the door.\nWhen the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his hand, led him into the tent, and bade him take\nhis place among them; but Patroclus stood where he was and said, \u201cNoble sir, I may not stay, you cannot persuade\nme to come in; he that sent me is not one to be trifled with, and he bade me ask who the wounded man was whom\nyou were bearing away from the field. I can now see for myself that he is Machaon shepherd of his people. I must\ngo back and tell Achilles. You, sir, know what a terrible man he is, and how ready to blame even where no blame\nshould lie.\u201d\nAnd Nestor answered, \u201cWhy should Achilles care to know how many of the Achaeans may be wounded? He\nrecks not of the dismay that reigns in our host; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave Diomed son of Tydeus\nis wounded; so are Ulysses and Agamemnon; Eurypylus has been hit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just\nbeen bringing this man from the field\u2014he too wounded\u2014with an arrow; nevertheless Achilles, so valiant though\nhe be, cares not and knows no ruth. Will he wait till the ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and we perish one\nupon the other? As for me, I have no strength nor stay in me any longer; would that I Were still young and strong as\nin the days when there was a fight between us and the men of Elis about some cattle-raiding. I then killed Itymo-\nneus the valiant son of Hypeirochus a dweller in Elis, as I was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart thrown my\nhand while fighting in the front rank in defence of his cows, so he fell and the country people around him were in\ngreat fear. We drove off a vast quantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds of cattle and as many flocks of sheep;\nfifty droves also of pigs, and as many wide-spreading flocks of goats. Of horses moreover we seized a hundred and\nfifty, all of them mares, and many had foals running with them. All these did we drive by night to Pylus the city of\nNeleus, taking them within the city; and the heart of Neleus was glad in that I had taken so much, though it was the\nfirst time I had ever been in the field. At daybreak the heralds went round crying that all in Elis to whom there was\na debt owing should come; and the leading Pylians assembled to divide the spoils. There were many to whom the\nEpeans owed chattels, for we men of Pylus were few and had been oppressed with wrong; in former years Hercules\nhad come, and had laid his hand heavy upon us, so that all our best men had perished. Neleus had had twelve sons,\nbut I alone was left; the others had all been killed. The Epeans presuming upon all this had looked down upon us\nand had done us much evil. My father chose a herd of cattle and a great flock of sheep\u2014three hundred in all\u2014and\nhe took their shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to him in Elis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes.\nThey and their chariots with them had gone to the games and were to run for a tripod, but King Augeas took them,\nand sent back their driver grieving for the loss of his horses. Neleus was angered by what he had both said and\ndone, and took great value in return, but he divided the rest, that no man might have less than his full share.\n\u201cThus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods throughout the city; but three days afterwards the\nEpeans came in a body, many in number, they and their chariots, in full array, and with them the two Moliones in\ntheir armour, though they were still lads and unused to fighting. Now there is a certain town, Thryoessa, perched\nupon a rock on the river Alpheus, the border city Pylus; this they would destroy, and pitched their camp about it,\nbut when they had crossed their whole plain, Minerva darted down by night from Olympus and bade us set our-\nselves in array; and she found willing soldiers in Pylos, for the men meant fighting. Neleus would not let me arm,\nand hid my horses, for he said that as yet I could know nothing about war; nevertheless Minerva so ordered the\nfight that, all on foot as I was, I fought among our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of them. There is a\nriver Minyeius that falls into the sea near Arene, and there they that were mounted (and I with them) waited till\nmorning, when the companies of foot soldiers came up with us in force. Thence in full panoply and equipment we\ncame towards noon to the sacred waters of the Alpheus, and there we offered victims to almighty Jove, with a bull\nto Alpheus, another to Neptune, and a herd-heifer to Minerva. After this we took supper in our companies, and laid\nus down to rest each in his armour by the river.\n\u201cThe Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to take it, but ere this might be there was a des-\nperate fight in store for them. When the sun\u2019s rays began to fall upon the earth we joined battle, praying to Jove and\nto Minerva, and when the fight had begun, I was the first to kill my man and take his horses\u2014to wit the warrior\nMulius. He was son-in-law to Augeas, having married his eldest daughter, golden-haired Agamede, who knew the\nvirtues of every herb which grows upon the face of the earth. I speared him as he was coming towards me, and\nwhen he fell headlong in the dust, I sprang upon his chariot and took my place in the front ranks. The Epeans fled\n160 The Iliad\nin all directions when they saw the captain of their horsemen (the best man they had) laid low, and I swept down on\nthem like a whirlwind, taking fifty chariots\u2014and in each of them two men bit the dust, slain by my spear. I should\nhave even killed the two Moliones sons of Actor, unless their real father, Neptune lord of the earthquake, had hid-\nden them in a thick mist and borne them out of the fight. Thereon Jove vouchsafed the Pylians a great victory, for\nwe chased them far over the plain, killing the men and bringing in their armour, till we had brought our horses to\nBuprasium rich in wheat and to the Olenian rock, with the hill that is called Alision, at which point Minerva turned\nthe people back. There I slew the last man and left him; then the Achaeans drove their horses back from Buprasium\nto Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among the gods, and among mortal men to Nestor.\n\u201cSuch was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles is for keeping all his valour for himself; bitterly\nwill he rue it hereafter when the host is being cut to pieces. My good friend, did not Menoetius charge you thus, on\nthe day when he sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon? Ulysses and I were in the house, inside, and heard all that\nhe said to you; for we came to the fair house of Peleus while beating up recruits throughout all Achaea, and when\nwe got there we found Menoetius and yourself, and Achilles with you. The old knight Peleus was in the outer court,\nroasting the fat thigh-bones of a heifer to Jove the lord of thunder; and he held a gold chalice in his hand from\nwhich he poured drink-offerings of wine over the burning sacrifice. You two were busy cutting up the heifer, and\nat that moment we stood at the gates, whereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led us by the hand into the house, placed\nus at table, and set before us such hospitable entertainment as guests expect. When we had satisfied ourselves with\nmeat and drink, I said my say and urged both of you to join us. You were ready enough to do so, and the two old\nmen charged you much and straitly. Old Peleus bade his son Achilles fight ever among the foremost and outvie his\npeers, while Menoetius the son of Actor spoke thus to you: \u2018My son,\u2019 said he, \u2018Achilles is of nobler birth than you\nare, but you are older than he, though he is far the better man of the two. Counsel him wisely, guide him in the right\nway, and he will follow you to his own profit.\u2019 Thus did your father charge you, but you have forgotten; neverthe-\nless, even now, say all this to Achilles if he will listen to you. Who knows but with heaven\u2019s help you may talk him\nover, for it is good to take a friend\u2019s advice. If, however, he is fearful about some oracle, or if his mother has told\nhim something from Jove, then let him send you, and let the rest of the Myrmidons follow with you, if perchance\nyou may bring light and saving to the Danaans. And let him send you into battle clad in his own armour, that the\nTrojans may mistake you for him and leave off fighting; the sons of the Achaeans may thus have time to get their\nbreath, for they are hard pressed and there is little breathing time in battle. You, who are fresh, might easily drive a\ntired enemy back to his walls and away from the tents and ships.\u201d\nWith these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set off running by the line of the ships to Achilles,\ndescendant of Aeacus. When he had got as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was their place of assembly and court\nof justice, with their altars dedicated to the gods, Eurypylus son of Euaemon met him, wounded in the thigh with\nan arrow, and limping out of the fight. Sweat rained from his head and shoulders, and black blood welled from his\ncruel wound, but his mind did not wander. The son of Menoetius when he saw him had compassion upon him\nand spoke piteously saying, \u201cO unhappy princes and counsellors of the Danaans, are you then doomed to feed the\nhounds of Troy with your fat, far from your friends and your native land? say, noble Eurypylus, will the Achaeans\nbe able to hold great Hector in check, or will they fall now before his spear?\u201d\nWounded Eurypylus made answer, \u201cNoble Patroclus, there is no hope left for the Achaeans but they will perish\nat their ships. All they that were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at the hands of the Trojans,\nwho are waxing stronger and stronger. But save me and take me to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh;\nwash the black blood from off it with warm water, and lay upon it those gracious herbs which, so they say, have\nbeen shown you by Achilles, who was himself shown them by Chiron, most righteous of all the centaurs. For of the\nphysicians Podalirius and Machaon, I hear that the one is lying wounded in his tent and is himself in need of heal-\ning, while the other is fighting the Trojans upon the plain.\u201d\n\u201cHero Eurypylus,\u201d replied the brave son of Menoetius, \u201chow may these things be? What can I do? I am on my\nway to bear a message to noble Achilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans, but even so I will not be\nunmindful your distress.\u201d\nWith this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent, and a servant, when he saw him, spread\nbullock-skins on the ground for him to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharp arrow from his thigh;\nhe washed the black blood from the wound with warm water; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between his\nhands, and spread it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb which killed all pain; so the wound presently dried\nand the blood left off flowing.\nBook XII\nSO THE son of Menoetius was attending to the hurt of Eurypylus within the tent, but the Argives and Trojans\nstill fought desperately, nor were the trench and the high wall above it, to keep the Trojans in check longer. They\n161 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nhad built it to protect their ships, and had dug the trench all round it that it might safeguard both the ships and\nthe rich spoils which they had taken, but they had not offered hecatombs to the gods. It had been built without the\nconsent of the immortals, and therefore it did not last. So long as Hector lived and Achilles nursed his anger, and\nso long as the city of Priam remained untaken, the great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of\nthe Trojans were no more, and many also of the Argives, though some were yet left alive when, moreover, the city\nwas sacked in the tenth year, and the Argives had gone back with their ships to their own country\u2014then Neptune\nand Apollo took counsel to destroy the wall, and they turned on to it the streams of all the rivers from Mount Ida\ninto the sea, Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus, Rhodius, Grenicus, Aesopus, and goodly Scamander, with Simois, where\nmany a shield and helm had fallen, and many a hero of the race of demigods had bitten the dust. Phoebus Apollo\nturned the mouths of all these rivers together and made them flow for nine days against the wall, while Jove rained\nthe whole time that he might wash it sooner into the sea. Neptune himself, trident in hand, surveyed the work and\nthrew into the sea all the foundations of beams and stones which the Achaeans had laid with so much toil; he made\nall level by the mighty stream of the Hellespont, and then when he had swept the wall away he spread a great beach\nof sand over the place where it had been. This done he turned the rivers back into their old courses.\nThis was what Neptune and Apollo were to do in after time; but as yet battle and turmoil were still raging round\nthe wall till its timbers rang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives, cowed by the scourge of Jove,\nwere hemmed in at their ships in fear of Hector the mighty minister of Rout, who as heretofore fought with the\nforce and fury of a whirlwind. As a lion or wild boar turns fiercely on the dogs and men that attack him, while these\nform solid wall and shower their javelins as they face him \u2014 his courage is all undaunted, but his high spirit will be\nthe death of him; many a time does he charge at his pursuers to scatter them, and they fall back as often as he does\nso\u2014even so did Hector go about among the host exhorting his men, and cheering them on to cross the trench.\nBut the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its brink, for the width frightened them. They could\nneither jump it nor cross it, for it had overhanging banks all round upon either side, above which there were the\nsharp stakes that the sons of the Achaeans had planted so close and strong as a defence against all who would assail\nit; a horse, therefore, could not get into it and draw his chariot after him, but those who were on foot kept trying\ntheir very utmost. Then Polydamas went up to Hector and said, \u201cHector, and you other captains of the Trojans and\nallies, it is madness for us to try and drive our horses across the trench; it will be very hard to cross, for it is full of\nsharp stakes, and beyond these there is the wall. Our horses therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of no\nuse if they did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come to harm. If, indeed, great Jove is minded to help\nthe Trojans, and in his anger will utterly destroy the Achaeans, I would myself gladly see them perish now and here\nfar from Argos; but if they should rally and we are driven back from the ships pell-mell into the trench there will\nbe not so much as a man get back to the city to tell the tale. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let our squires hold\nour horses by the trench, but let us follow Hector in a body on foot, clad in full armour, and if the day of their doom\nis at hand the Achaeans will not be able to withstand us.\u201d\nThus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased Hector, who sprang in full armour to the ground, and all the oth-\ner Trojans, when they saw him do so, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his horses over to his charioteer\nin charge to hold them ready for him at the trench. Then they formed themselves into companies, made themselves\nready, and in five bodies followed their leaders. Those that went with Hector and Polydamas were the bravest and\nmost in number, and the most determined to break through the wall and fight at the ships. Cebriones was also\njoined with them as third in command, for Hector had left his chariot in charge of a less valiant soldier. The next\ncompany was led by Paris, Alcathous, and Agenor; the third by Helenus and Deiphobus, two sons of Priam, and\nwith them was the hero Asius\u2014Asius the son of Hyrtacus, whose great black horses of the breed that comes from\nthe river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe. Aeneas the valiant son of Anchises led the fourth; he and the two\nsons of Antenor, Archelochus and Acamas, men well versed in all the arts of war. Sarpedon was captain over the\nallies, and took with him Glaucus and Asteropaeus whom he deemed most valiant after himself\u2014for he was far the\nbest man of them all. These helped to array one another in their ox-hide shields, and then charged straight at the\nDanaans, for they felt sure that they would not hold out longer and that they should themselves now fall upon the\nships.\nThe rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel of Polydamas but Asius son of Hyrtacus would\nnot leave his horses and his esquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took them on with him towards the ships,\nnor did he fail to come by his end in consequence. Nevermore was he to return to wind-beaten Ilius, exulting in his\nchariot and his horses; ere he could do so, death of ill-omened name had overshadowed him and he had fallen by\nthe spear of Idomeneus the noble son of Deucalion. He had driven towards the left wing of the ships, by which way\nthe Achaeans used to return with their chariots and horses from the plain. Hither he drove and found the gates with\ntheir doors opened wide, and the great bar down\u2014for the gatemen kept them open so as to let those of their com-\nrades enter who might be flying towards the ships. Hither of set purpose did he direct his horses, and his men fol-\nlowed him with a loud cry, for they felt sure that the Achaeans would not hold out longer, and that they should now\n162 The Iliad\nfall upon the ships. Little did they know that at the gates they should find two of the bravest chieftains, proud sons\nof the fighting Lapithae\u2014the one, Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, and the other Leonteus, peer of murderous\nMars. These stood before the gates like two high oak trees upon the mountains, that tower from their wide-spread-\ning roots, and year after year battle with wind and rain\u2014even so did these two men await the onset of great Asius\nconfidently and without flinching. The Trojans led by him and by Iamenus, Orestes, Adamas the son of Asius,\nThoon and Oenomaus, raised a loud cry of battle and made straight for the wall, holding their shields of dry ox-\nhide above their heads; for a while the two defenders remained inside and cheered the Achaeans on to stand firm in\nthe defence of their ships; when, however, they saw that the Trojans were attacking the wall, while the Danaans were\ncrying out for help and being routed, they rushed outside and fought in front of the gates like two wild boars upon\nthe mountains that abide the attack of men and dogs, and charging on either side break down the wood all round\nthem tearing it up by the roots, and one can hear the clattering of their tusks, till some one hits them and makes an\nend of them\u2014even so did the gleaming bronze rattle about their breasts, as the weapons fell upon them; for they\nfought with great fury, trusting to their own prowess and to those who were on the wall above them. These threw\ngreat stones at their assailants in defence of themselves their tents and their ships. The stones fell thick as the flakes\nof snow which some fierce blast drives from the dark clouds and showers down in sheets upon the earth\u2014even\nso fell the weapons from the hands alike of Trojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang out as the great stones\nrained upon them, and Asius the son of Hyrtacus in his dismay cried aloud and smote his two thighs. \u201cFather Jove,\u201d\nhe cried, \u201cof a truth you too are altogether given to lying. I made sure the Argive heroes could not withstand us,\nwhereas like slim-waisted wasps, or bees that have their nests in the rocks by the wayside\u2014they leave not the holes\nwherein they have built undefended, but fight for their little ones against all who would take them \u2014 even so these\nmen, though they be but two, will not be driven from the gates, but stand firm either to slay or be slain.\u201d\nHe spoke, but moved not the mind of Jove, whose counsel it then was to give glory to Hector. Meanwhile the\nrest of the Trojans were fighting about the other gates; I, however, am no god to be able to tell about all these things,\nfor the battle raged everywhere about the stone wall as it were a fiery furnace. The Argives, discomfited though they\nwere, were forced to defend their ships, and all the gods who were defending the Achaeans were vexed in spirit; but\nthe Lapithae kept on fighting with might and main.\nThereon Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, hit Damasus with a spear upon his cheek-pierced helmet. The\nhelmet did not protect him, for the point of the spear went through it, and broke the bone, so that the brain inside\nwas scattered about, and he died fighting. He then slew Pylon and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race of Mars, killed\nHippomachus the son of Antimachus by striking him with his spear upon the girdle. He then drew his sword and\nsprang first upon Antiphates whom he killed in combat, and who fell face upwards on the earth. After him he killed\nMenon, Iamenus, and Orestes, and laid them low one after the other.\nWhile they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, the youths who were led on by Polydamas and\nHector (and these were the greater part and the most valiant of those that were trying to break through the wall and\nfire the ships) were still standing by the trench, uncertain what they should do; for they had seen a sign from heav-\nen when they had essayed to cross it\u2014a soaring eagle that flew skirting the left wing of their host, with a monstrous\nblood-red snake in its talons still alive and struggling to escape. The snake was still bent on revenge, wriggling and\ntwisting itself backwards till it struck the bird that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the bird being in pain,\nlet it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host, and then flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans were\nstruck with terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing Jove, writhing in the midst of them, and Poly-\ndamas went up to Hector and said, \u201cHector, at our councils of war you are ever given to rebuke me, even when I\nspeak wisely, as though it were not well, forsooth, that one of the people should cross your will either in the field or\nat the council board; you would have them support you always: nevertheless I will say what I think will be best; let\nus not now go on to fight the Danaans at their ships, for I know what will happen if this soaring eagle which skirted\nthe left wing of our with a monstrous blood-red snake in its talons (the snake being still alive) was really sent as an\nomen to the Trojans on their essaying to cross the trench. The eagle let go her hold; she did not succeed in taking it\nhome to her little ones, and so will it be\u2014with ourselves; even though by a mighty effort we break through the gates\nand wall of the Achaeans, and they give way before us, still we shall not return in good order by the way we came,\nbut shall leave many a man behind us whom the Achaeans will do to death in defence of their ships. Thus would\nany seer who was expert in these matters, and was trusted by the people, read the portent.\u201d\nHector looked fiercely at him and said, \u201cPolydamas, I like not of your reading. You can find a better saying than\nthis if you will. If, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of your reason.\nYou would have me pay no heed to the counsels of Jove, nor to the promises he made me\u2014and he bowed his head\nin confirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight of wild-fowl. What care I whether they fly towards dawn\nor dark, and whether they be on my right hand or on my left? Let us put our trust rather in the counsel of great\nJove, king of mortals and immortals. There is one omen, and one only\u2014that a man should fight for his country.\nWhy are you so fearful? Though we be all of us slain at the ships of the Argives you are not likely to be killed your-\n163 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nself, for you are not steadfast nor courageous. If you will. not fight, or would talk others over from doing so, you\nshall fall forthwith before my spear.\u201d\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after with a cry that rent the air. Then Jove the lord\nof thunder sent the blast of a mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore the dust down towards the ships;\nhe thus lulled the Achaeans into security, and gave victory to Hector and to the Trojans, who, trusting to their\nown might and to the signs he had shown them, essayed to break through the great wall of the Achaeans. They\ntore down the breastworks from the walls, and overthrew the battlements; they upheaved the buttresses, which the\nAchaeans had set in front of the wall in order to support it; when they had pulled these down they made sure of\nbreaking through the wall, but the Danaans still showed no sign of giving ground; they still fenced the battlements\nwith their shields of ox-hide, and hurled their missiles down upon the foe as soon as any came below the wall.\nThe two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on the Achaeans, giving fair words to some while\nthey spoke sharply to any one whom they saw to be remiss. \u201cMy friends,\u201d they cried, \u201cArgives one and all\u2014good\nbad and indifferent, for there was never fight yet, in which all were of equal prowess\u2014there is now work enough, as\nyou very well know, for all of you. See that you none of you turn in flight towards the ships, daunted by the shouting\nof the foe, but press forward and keep one another in heart, if it may so be that Olympian Jove the lord of lightning\nwill vouchsafe us to repel our foes, and drive them back towards the city.\u201d\nThus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on. As the flakes that fall thick upon a winter\u2019s\nday, when Jove is minded to snow and to display these his arrows to mankind\u2014he lulls the wind to rest, and snows\nhour after hour till he has buried the tops of the high mountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassy\nplains, and the tilled fields of men; the snow lies deep upon the forelands, and havens of the grey sea, but the waves\nas they come rolling in stay it that it can come no further, though all else is wrapped as with a mantle so heavy are\nthe heavens with snow\u2014even thus thickly did the stones fall on one side and on the other, some thrown at the Tro-\njans, and some by the Trojans at the Achaeans; and the whole wall was in an uproar.\nStill the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken down the gates and the great bar, had not Jove\nturned his son Sarpedon against the Argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle. Before him he held his shield\nof hammered bronze, that the smith had beaten so fair and round, and had lined with ox hides which he had made\nfast with rivets of gold all round the shield; this he held in front of him, and brandishing his two spears came on\nlike some lion of the wilderness, who has been long famished for want of meat and will dare break even into a\nwell-fenced homestead to try and get at the sheep. He may find the shepherds keeping watch over their flocks with\ndogs and spears, but he is in no mind to be driven from the fold till he has had a try for it; he will either spring on\na sheep and carry it off, or be hit by a spear from strong hand\u2014even so was Sarpedon fain to attack the wall and\nbreak down its battlements. Then he said to Glaucus son of Hippolochus, \u201cGlaucus, why in Lycia do we receive\nespecial honour as regards our place at table? Why are the choicest portions served us and our cups kept brimming,\nand why do men look up to us as though we were gods? Moreover we hold a large estate by the banks of the river\nXanthus, fair with orchard lawns and wheat-growing land; it becomes us, therefore, to take our stand at the head\nof all the Lycians and bear the brunt of the fight, that one may say to another, Our princes in Lycia eat the fat of the\nland and drink best of wine, but they are fine fellows; they fight well and are ever at the front in battle.\u2019 My good\nfriend, if, when we were once out of this fight, we could escape old age and death thenceforward and for ever, I\nshould neither press forward myself nor bid you do so, but death in ten thousand shapes hangs ever over our heads,\nand no man can elude him; therefore let us go forward and either win glory for ourselves, or yield it to another.\u201d\nGlaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host of Lycians. Menestheus son of Peteos was\ndismayed when he saw them, for it was against his part of the wall that they came\u2014bringing destruction with them;\nhe looked along the wall for some chieftain to support his comrades and saw the two Ajaxes, men ever eager for the\nfray, and Teucer, who had just come from his tent, standing near them; but he could not make his voice heard by\nshouting to them, so great an uproar was there from crashing shields and helmets and the battering of gates with a\ndin which reached the skies. For all the gates had been closed, and the Trojans were hammering at them to try and\nbreak their way through them. Menestheus, therefore, sent Thootes with a message to Ajax. \u201cRun, good Thootes,\u201d\nsaid and call Ajax, or better still bid both come, for it will be all over with us here directly; the leaders of the Lycians\nare upon us, men who have ever fought desperately heretofore. But if the have too much on their hands to let them\ncome, at any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer the famous bowman come with him.\u201d\nThe messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the wall of the Achaeans. When he reached the\nAjaxes he said to them, \u201cSirs, princes of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you come to him for a while and\nhelp him. You had better both come if you can, or it will be all over with him directly; the leaders of the Lycians are\nupon him, men who have ever fought desperately heretofore; if you have too much on your hands to let both come,\nat any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer the famous bowman come with him.\u201d\nGreat Ajax, son of Telamon, heeded the message, and at once spoke to the son of Oileus. \u201cAjax,\u201d said he, \u201cdo you\ntwo, yourself and brave Lycomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight their hardest. I will go over\n164 The Iliad\nyonder, and bear my part in the fray, but I will come back here at once as soon as I have given them the help they\nneed.\u201d\nWith this, Ajax son of Telamon set off, and Teucer his brother by the same father went also, with Pandion to\ncarry Teucer\u2019s bow. They went along inside the wall, and when they came to the tower where Menestheus was (and\nhard pressed indeed did they find him) the brave captains and leaders of the Lycians were storming the battlements\nas it were a thick dark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and raising the battle-cry aloud.\nFirst, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epicles, a comrade of Sarpedon, hitting him with a jagged stone that lay\nby the battlements at the very top of the wall. As men now are, even one who is in the bloom of youth could hardly\nlift it with his two hands, but Ajax raised it high aloft and flung it down, smashing Epicles\u2019 four-crested helmet so\nthat the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell from the high wall as though he were diving, with no\nmore life left in him. Then Teucer wounded Glaucus the brave son of Hippolochus as he was coming on to attack\nthe wall. He saw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at it, which made Glaucus leave off fighting. Thereon he\nsprang covertly down for fear some of the Achaeans might see that he was wounded and taunt him. Sarpedon was\nstung with grief when he saw Glaucus leave him, still he did not leave off fighting, but aimed his spear at Alcma-\non the son of Thestor and hit him. He drew his spear back again Alcmaon came down headlong after it with his\nbronzed armour rattling round him. Then Sarpedon seized the battlement in his strong hands, and tugged at it till it\nan gave way together, and a breach was made through which many might pass.\nAjax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit him with an arrow on the band that bore the shield\nwhich covered his body, but Jove saved his son from destruction that he might not fall by the ships\u2019 sterns. Mean-\nwhile Ajax sprang on him and pierced his shield, but the spear did not go clean through, though it hustled him back\nthat he could come on no further. He therefore retired a little space from the battlement, yet without losing all his\nground, for he still thought to cover himself with glory. Then he turned round and shouted to the brave Lycians\nsaying, \u201cLycians, why do you thus fail me? For all my prowess I cannot break through the wall and open a way to\nthe ships single-handed. Come close on behind me, for the more there are of us the better.\u201d\nThe Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who was their counsellor their king. The Argives\non their part got their men in fighting order within the wall, and there was a deadly struggle between them. The\nLycians could not break through the wall and force their way to the ships, nor could the Danaans drive the Lycians\nfrom the wall now that they had once reached it. As two men, measuring-rods in hand, quarrel about their bound-\naries in a field that they own in common, and stickle for their rights though they be but in a mere strip, even so did\nthe battlements now serve as a bone of contention, and they beat one another\u2019s round shields for their possession.\nMany a man\u2019s body was wounded with the pitiless bronze, as he turned round and bared his back to the foe, and\nmany were struck clean through their shields; the wall and battlements were everywhere deluged with the blood\nalike of Trojans and of Achaeans. But even so the Trojans could not rout the Achaeans, who still held on; and as\nsome honest hard-working woman weighs wool in her balance and sees that the scales be true, for she would gain\nsome pitiful earnings for her little ones, even so was the fight balanced evenly between them till the time came\nwhen Jove gave the greater glory to Hector son of Priam, who was first to spring towards the wall of the Achaeans.\nAs he did so, he cried aloud to the Trojans, \u201cUp, Trojans, break the wall of the Argives, and fling fire upon their\nships.\u201d\nThus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight at the wall as he had bidden them, and\nscaled the battlements with sharp spears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone that lay just outside the gates\nand was thick at one end but pointed at the other; two of the best men in a town, as men now are, could hardly raise\nit from the ground and put it on to a waggon, but Hector lifted it quite easily by himself, for the son of scheming\nSaturn made it light for him. As a shepherd picks up a ram\u2019s fleece with one hand and finds it no burden, so easily\ndid Hector lift the great stone and drive it right at the doors that closed the gates so strong and so firmly set. These\ndoors were double and high, and were kept closed by two cross-bars to which there was but one key. When he had\ngot close up to them, Hector strode towards them that his blow might gain in force and struck them in the middle,\nleaning his whole weight against them. He broke both hinges, and the stone fell inside by reason of its great weight.\nThe portals re-echoed with the sound, the bars held no longer, and the doors flew open, one one way, and the other\nthe other, through the force of the blow. Then brave Hector leaped inside with a face as dark as that of flying night.\nThe gleaming bronze flashed fiercely about his body and he had tow spears in his hand. None but a god could have\nwithstood him as he flung himself into the gateway, and his eyes glared like fire. Then he turned round towards the\nTrojans and called on them to scale the wall, and they did as he bade them\u2014some of them at once climbing over\nthe wall, while others passed through the gates. The Danaans then fled panic-stricken towards their ships, and all\nwas uproar and confusion.\nBook XIII\n165 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nNOW when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to the ships, he left them to their never-ending toil,\nand turned his keen eyes away, looking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of Thrace, the Mysians, fighters at\nclose quarters, the noble Hippemolgi, who live on milk, and the Abians, justest of mankind. He no longer turned so\nmuch as a glance towards Troy, for he did not think that any of the immortals would go and help either Trojans or\nDanaans.\nBut King Neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been looking admiringly on the battle from his seat on\nthe topmost crests of wooded Samothrace, whence he could see all Ida, with the city of Priam and the ships of the\nAchaeans. He had come from under the sea and taken his place here, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being\novercome by the Trojans; and he was furiously angry with Jove.\nPresently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as he strode swiftly onwards the high hills and\nthe forest quaked beneath the tread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took, and with the fourth he reached his\ngoal\u2014Aegae, where is his glittering golden palace, imperishable, in the depths of the sea. When he got there, he\nyoked his fleet brazen-footed steeds with their manes of gold all flying in the wind; he clothed himself in raiment of\ngold, grasped his gold whip, and took his stand upon his chariot. As he went his way over the waves the sea-mon-\nsters left their lairs, for they knew their lord, and came gambolling round him from every quarter of the deep, while\nthe sea in her gladness opened a path before his chariot. So lightly did the horses fly that the bronze axle of the car\nwas not even wet beneath it; and thus his bounding steeds took him to the ships of the Achaeans.\nNow there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midway between Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here\nNeptune lord of the earthquake stayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them their ambrosial forage. He\nhobbled their feet with hobbles of gold which none could either unloose or break, so that they might stay there in\nthat place until their lord should return. This done he went his way to the host of the Achaeans.\nNow the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like a storm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with\nmight and main and raising the cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of the Achaeans and kill\nall their chiefest heroes then and there. Meanwhile earth-encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake cheered on the\nArgives, for he had come up out of the sea and had assumed the form and voice of Calchas.\nFirst he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already, and said, \u201cAjaxes, you two can be the saving\nof the Achaeans if you will put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted. I am not afraid that the\nTrojans, who have got over the wall in force, will be victorious in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all of\nthem in check, but I much fear that some evil will befall us here where furious Hector, who boasts himself the son\nof great Jove himself, is leading them on like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put it into your hearts to make a\nfirm stand here, and to incite others to do the like. In this case you will drive him from the ships even though he be\ninspired by Jove himself.\u201d\nAs he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck both of them with his sceptre and filled their\nhearts with daring. He made their legs light and active, as also their hands and their feet. Then, as the soaring falcon\npoises on the wing high above some sheer rock, and presently swoops down to chase some bird over the plain, even\nso did Neptune lord of the earthquake wing his flight into the air and leave them. Of the two, swift Ajax son of Oil-\neus was the first to know who it was that had been speaking with them, and said to Ajax son of Telamon, \u201cAjax, this\nis one of the gods that dwell on Olympus, who in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by our ships. It\nwas not Calchas the seer and diviner of omens; I knew him at once by his feet and knees as he turned away, for the\ngods are soon recognised. Moreover I feel the lust of battle burn more fiercely within me, while my hands and my\nfeet under me are more eager for the fray.\u201d\nAnd Ajax son of Telamon answered, \u201cI too feel my hands grasp my spear more firmly; my strength is greater,\nand my feet more nimble; I long, moreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam, even in single combat.\u201d\nThus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with which the god had filled them. Meanwhile the\nearth-encircler roused the Achaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome at once by hard fighting\nand by grief at seeing that the Trojans had got over the wall in force. Tears began falling from their eyes as they be-\nheld them, for they made sure that they should not escape destruction; but the lord of the earthquake passed lightly\nabout among them and urged their battalions to the front.\nFirst he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, and Thoas and Deipyrus; Meriones also and Antilo-\nchus, valiant warriors; all did he exhort. \u201cShame on you young Argives,\u201d he cried, \u201cit was on your prowess I relied\nfor the saving of our ships; if you fight not with might and main, this very day will see us overcome by the Trojans.\nOf a truth my eyes behold a great and terrible portent which I had never thought to see\u2014the Trojans at our ships\u2014\nthey, who were heretofore like panic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals and wolves in a forest, with no strength but\nin flight for they cannot defend themselves. Hitherto the Trojans dared not for one moment face the attack of the\nAchaeans, but now they have sallied far from their city and are fighting at our very ships through the cowardice of\nour leader and the disaffection of the people themselves, who in their discontent care not to fight in defence of the\nships but are being slaughtered near them. True, King Agamemnon son of Atreus is the cause of our disaster by\n166 The Iliad\nhaving insulted the son of Peleus, still this is no reason why we should leave off fighting. Let us be quick to heal, for\nthe hearts of the brave heal quickly. You do ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the finest soldiers in our whole army.\nI blame no man for keeping out of battle if he is a weakling, but I am indignant with such men as you are. My good\nfriends, matters will soon become even worse through this slackness; think, each one of you, of his own honour and\ncredit, for the hazard of the fight is extreme. Great Hector is now fighting at our ships; he has broken through the\ngates and the strong bolt that held them.\u201d\nThus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge them on. Thereon round the two Ajaxes there gath-\nered strong bands of men, of whom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could make light if they went\namong them, for they were the picked men of all those who were now awaiting the onset of Hector and the Trojans.\nThey made a living fence, spear to spear, shield to shield, buckler to buckler, helmet to helmet, and man to man. The\nhorse-hair crests on their gleaming helmets touched one another as they nodded forward, so closely seffied were\nthey; the spears they brandished in their strong hands were interlaced, and their hearts were set on battle.\nThe Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their head pressing right on as a rock that comes thun-\ndering down the side of some mountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; the foundations of the\ndull thing have been loosened by floods of rain, and as it bounds headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in an\nuproar; it swerves neither to right nor left till it reaches level ground, but then for all its fury it can go no further\u2014\neven so easily did Hector for a while seem as though he would career through the tents and ships of the Achaeans\ntill he had reached the sea in his murderous course; but the closely serried battalions stayed him when he reached\nthem, for the sons of the Achaeans thrust at him with swords and spears pointed at both ends, and drove him from\nthem so that he staggered and gave ground; thereon he shouted to the Trojans, \u201cTrojans, Lycians, and Dardanians,\nfighters in close combat, stand firm: the Achaeans have set themselves as a wall against me, but they will not check\nme for long; they will give ground before me if the mightiest of the gods, the thundering spouse of Juno, has indeed\ninspired my onset.\u201d\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobus son of Priam went about among them intent\non deeds of daring with his round shield before him, under cover of which he strode quickly forward. Meriones\ntook aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hit the broad orb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for the\nspear broke in two pieces long ere he could do so; moreover Deiphobus had seen it coming and had held his shield\nwell away from him. Meriones drew back under cover of his comrades, angry alike at having failed to vanquish\nDeiphobus, and having broken his spear. He turned therefore towards the ships and tents to fetch a spear which he\nhad left behind in his tent.\nThe others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into the heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the\nfirst to kill his man, to wit, the warrior Imbrius son of Mentor rich in horses. Until the Achaeans came he had lived\nin Pedaeum, and had married Medesicaste a bastard daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet he\nhad gone back to Ilius, and was a great man among the Trojans, dwelling near Priam himself, who gave him like\nhonour with his own sons. The son of Telamon now struck him under the ear with a spear which he then drew\nback again, and Imbrius fell headlong as an ash-tree when it is felled on the crest of some high mountain beacon,\nand its delicate green foliage comes toppling down to the ground. Thus did he fall with his bronze-dight armour\nringing harshly round him, and Teucer sprang forward with intent to strip him of his armour; but as he was doing\nso, Hector took aim at him with a spear. Teucer saw the spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hit Amphima-\nchus, son of Cteatus son of Actor, in the chest as he was coming into battle, and his armour rang rattling round him\nas he fell heavily to the ground. Hector sprang forward to take Amphimachus\u2019s helmet from off his temples, and in\na moment Ajax threw a spear at him, but did not wound him, for he was encased all over in his terrible armour;\nnevertheless the spear struck the boss of his shield with such force as to drive him back from the two corpses, which\nthe Achaeans then drew off. Stichius and Menestheus, captains of the Athenians, bore away Amphimachus to the\nhost of the Achaeans, while the two brave and impetuous Ajaxes did the like by Imbrius. As two lions snatch a goat\nfrom the hounds that have it in their fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high above the ground in their\njaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the body of Imbrius, and strip it of its armour. Then the son of Oileus severed\nthe head from the neck in revenge for the death of Amphimachus, and sent it whirling over the crowd as though it\nhad been a ball, till fell in the dust at Hector\u2019s feet.\nNeptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus should have fallen; he therefore went to the\ntents and ships of the Achaeans to urge the Danaans still further, and to devise evil for the Trojans. Idomeneus\nmet him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, who had just come to him from the fight, wounded in the knee. His\nfellow-soldiers bore him off the field, and Idomeneus having given orders to the physicians went on to his tent, for\nhe was still thirsting for battle. Neptune spoke in the likeness and with the voice of Thoas son of Andraemon who\nruled the Aetolians of all Pleuron and high Calydon, and was honoured among his people as though he were a god.\n\u201cIdomeneus,\u201d said he, \u201clawgiver to the Cretans, what has now become of the threats with which the sons of the\nAchaeans used to threaten the Trojans?\u201d\n167 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAnd Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, \u201cThoas, no one, so far as I know, is in fault, for we can all\nfight. None are held back neither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the of almighty Jove that the Achaeans\nshould perish ingloriously here far from Argos: you, Thoas, have been always staunch, and you keep others in heart\nif you see any fail in duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all to do their utmost.\u201d\nTo this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, \u201cIdomeneus, may he never return from Troy, but remain\nhere for dogs to batten upon, who is this day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armour and go, we must make all\nhaste together if we may be of any use, though we are only two. Even cowards gain courage from companionship,\nand we two can hold our own with the bravest.\u201d\nTherewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and Idomeneus when he had reached his tent donned\nhis armour, grasped his two spears, and sallied forth. As the lightning which the son of Saturn brandishes from\nbright Olympus when he would show a sign to mortals, and its gleam flashes far and wide\u2014even so did his armour\ngleam about him as he ran. Meriones his sturdy squire met him while he was still near his tent (for he was going to\nfetch his spear) and Idomeneus said\n\u201cMeriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you left the field? Are you wounded, and is the point\nof the weapon hurting you? or have you been sent to fetch me? I want no fetching; I had far rather fight than stay in\nmy tent.\u201d\n\u201cIdomeneus,\u201d answered Meriones, \u201cI come for a spear, if I can find one in my tent; I have broken the one I had,\nin throwing it at the shield of Deiphobus.\u201d\nAnd Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, \u201cYou will find one spear, or twenty if you so please, standing\nup against the end wall of my tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have killed, for I am not one to keep my\nenemy at arm\u2019s length; therefore I have spears, bossed shields, helmets, and burnished corslets.\u201d\nThen Meriones said, \u201cI too in my tent and at my ship have spoils taken from the Trojans, but they are not at\nhand. I have been at all times valorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting have held my own among the\nforemost. There may be those among the Achaeans who do not know how I fight, but you know it well enough\nyourself.\u201d\nIdomeneus answered, \u201cI know you for a brave man: you need not tell me. If the best men at the ships were\nbeing chosen to go on an ambush\u2014and there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of; it comes out\nthen who is cowardly and who brave; the coward will change colour at every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and\nkeeps shifting his weight first on one knee and then on the other; his heart beats fast as he thinks of death, and one\ncan hear the chattering of his teeth; whereas the brave man will not change colour nor be on finding himself in\nambush, but is all the time longing to go into action\u2014if the best men were being chosen for such a service, no one\ncould make light of your courage nor feats of arms. If you were struck by a dart or smitten in close combat, it would\nnot be from behind, in your neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest or belly as you were pressing\nforward to a place in the front ranks. But let us no longer stay here talking like children, lest we be ill spoken of; go,\nfetch your spear from the tent at once.\u201d\nOn this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself a spear of bronze. He then followed after\nIdomeneus, big with great deeds of valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to battle, and his son Panic so strong\nand dauntless goes with him, to strike terror even into the heart of a hero\u2014the pair have gone from Thrace to arm\nthemselves among the Ephyri or the brave Phlegyans, but they will not listen to both the contending hosts, and will\ngive victory to one side or to the other\u2014even so did Meriones and Idomeneus, captains of men, go out to battle\nclad in their bronze armour. Meriones was first to speak. \u201cSon of Deucalion,\u201d said he, \u201cwhere would you have us\nbegin fighting? On the right wing of the host, in the centre, or on the left wing, where I take it the Achaeans will be\nweakest?\u201d\nIdomeneus answered, \u201cThere are others to defend the centre\u2014the two Ajaxes and Teucer, who is the finest\narcher of all the Achaeans, and is good also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will give Hector son of Priam enough\nto do; fight as he may, he will find it hard to vanquish their indomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son of\nSaturn fling a firebrand upon them with his own hand. Great Ajax son of Telamon will yield to no man who is in\nmortal mould and eats the grain of Ceres, if bronze and great stones can overthrow him. He would not yield even\nto Achilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness of foot there is none to beat him; let us turn therefore towards the\nleft wing, that we may know forthwith whether we are to give glory to some other, or he to us.\u201d\nMeriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to the part of the host which Idomeneus had\nnamed.\nNow when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire, him and his squire clad in their richly\nwrought armour, they shouted and made towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fight raged under\nthe ships\u2019 sterns. Fierce as the shrill winds that whistle upon a day when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts\nraise it into a thick cloud\u2014even such was the fury of the combat, and might and main did they hack at each oth-\ner with spear and sword throughout the host. The field bristled with the long and deadly spears which they bore.\n168 The Iliad\nDazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their fresh-burnished breastplates, and glittering shields as they\njoined battle with one another. Iron indeed must be his courage who could take pleasure in the sight of such a tur-\nmoil, and look on it without being dismayed.\nThus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortal heroes. Jove was minded to give victory to the\nTrojans and to Hector, so as to do honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he did not mean to utterly overthrow the\nAchaean host before Ilius, and only wanted to glorify Thetis and her valiant son. Neptune on the other hand went\nabout among the Argives to incite them, having come up from the grey sea in secret, for he was grieved at seeing\nthem vanquished by the Trojans, and was furiously angry with Jove. Both were of the same race and country, but\nJove was elder born and knew more, therefore Neptune feared to defend the Argives openly, but in the likeness of\nman, he kept on encouraging them throughout their host. Thus, then, did these two devise a knot of war and battle,\nthat none could unloose or break, and set both sides tugging at it, to the failing of men\u2019s knees beneath them.\nAnd now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey, called loud on the Danaans and spread\npanic among the Trojans as he leaped in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a sojourner, who had but\nlately come to take part in the war. He sought Cassandra the fairest of Priam\u2019s daughters in marriage, but offered no\ngifts of wooing, for he promised a great thing, to wit, that he would drive the sons of the Achaeans willy nilly from\nTroy; old King Priam had given his consent and promised her to him, whereon he fought on the strength of the\npromises thus made to him. Idomeneus aimed a spear, and hit him as he came striding on. His cuirass of bronze\ndid not protect him, and the spear stuck in his belly, so that he fell heavily to the ground. Then Idomeneus vaunted\nover him saying, \u201cOthryoneus, there is no one in the world whom I shall admire more than I do you, if you indeed\nperform what you have promised Priam son of Dardanus in return for his daughter. We too will make you an offer;\nwe will give you the loveliest daughter of the son of Atreus, and will bring her from Argos for you to marry, if you\nwill sack the goodly city of Ilius in company with ourselves; so come along with me, that we may make a covenant\nat the ships about the marriage, and we will not be hard upon you about gifts of wooing.\u201d\nWith this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the thick of the fight, but Asius came up to\nprotect the body, on foot, in front of his horses which his esquire drove so close behind him that he could feel their\n\u2018breath upon his shoulder. He was longing to strike down Idomeneus, but ere he could do so Idomeneus smote him\nwith his spear in the throat under the chin, and the bronze point went clean through it. He fell as an oak, or poplar,\nor pine which shipwrights have felled for ship\u2019s timber upon the mountains with whetted axes\u2014even thus did he lie\nfull length in front of his chariot and horses, grinding his teeth and clutching at the bloodstained just. His chario-\nteer was struck with panic and did not dare turn his horses round and escape: thereupon Antilochus hit him in the\nmiddle of his body with a spear; his cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and the spear stuck in his belly. He fell\ngasping from his chariot and Antilochus great Nestor\u2019s son, drove his horses from the Trojans to the Achaeans.\nDeiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, and took aim at him with a spear, but Idomene-\nus was on the look-out and avoided it, for he was covered by the round shield he always bore\u2014a shield of oxhide\nand bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. He crouched under cover of this, and the spear flew over him, but\nthe shield rang out as the spear grazed it, and the weapon sped not in vain from the strong hand of Deiphobus,\nfor it struck Hypsenor son of Hippasus, shepherd of his people, in the liver under the midriff, and his limbs failed\nbeneath him. Deiphobus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying, \u201cOf a truth Asius has not fallen un-\navenied; he will be glad even while passing into the house of Hades, strong warden of the gate, that I have sent some\none to escort him.\u201d\nThus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying. Noble Antilochus was more angry than any one,\nbut grief did not make him forget his friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, and covered him with\nhis shield; then two of his staunch comrades, Mecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor stooped down, and bore him\naway groaning heavily to the ships. But Idomeneus ceased not his fury. He kept on striving continually either to\nenshroud some Trojan in the darkness of death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil day from the Achae-\nans. Then fell Alcathous son of noble Aesyetes: he was son-in-law to Anchises, having married his eldest daughter\nHippodameia who was the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her generation in beauty, accomplish-\nments, and understanding, wherefore the bravest man in all Troy had taken her to wife\u2014him did Neptune lay low\nby the hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and binding his strong limbs in fetters so that he could neither\ngo back nor to one side, but stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus struck him with a spear in the\nmiddle of his chest. The coat of mail that had hitherto protected his body was now broken, and rang harshly as the\nspear tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground, and the spear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the\nbutt-end of the spear quiver till dread Mars put an end to his life. Idomeneus vaunted over him and cried with a\nloud voice saying, \u201cDeiphobus, since you are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits now that we have killed three\nmen to your one? Nay, sir, stand in fight with me yourself, that you may learn what manner of Jove-begotten man\nam I that have come hither. Jove first begot Minos chief ruler in Crete, and Minos in his turn begot a son, noble\nDeucalion; Deucalion begot me to be a ruler over many men in Crete, and my ships have now brought me hither, to\n169 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nbe the bane of yourself, your father, and the Trojans.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go back and fetch some other Trojan to help\nhim, or to take up the challenge single-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and fetch Aeneas, whom he\nfound standing in the rear, for he had long been aggrieved with Priam because in spite his brave deeds he did not\ngive him his due share of honour. Deiphobus went up to him and said, \u201cAeneas, prince among the Trojans, if you\nknow any ties of kinship, help me now to defend the body of your sister\u2019s husband; come with me to the rescue of\nAlcathous, who being husband to your sister brought you up when you were a child in his house, and now Idome-\nneus has slain him.\u201d\nWith these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went in pursuit of Idomeneus, big with great deeds\nof valour; but Idomeneus was not to be thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held his ground as a wild\nboar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the coming of a great crowd of men in some lonely place\u2014the bris-\ntles stand upright on his back, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks in his eagerness to defend himself against\nhounds and men\u2014even so did famed Idomeneus hold his ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas. He cried\naloud to his comrades looking towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus, Deipyrus, Meriones, and Antilochus, all of them\nbrave soldiers\u2014\u201cHither my friends,\u201d he cried, \u201cand leave me not single-handed\u2014I go in great fear by fleet Aeneas,\nwho is coming against me, and is a redoubtable dispenser of death battle. Moreover he is in the flower of youth\nwhen a man\u2019s strength is greatest; if I was of the same age as he is and in my present mind, either he or I should\nsoon bear away the prize of victory\nOn this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on shoulder. Aeneas on the other side called to his\ncomrades, looking towards Deiphobus, Paris, and Agenor, who were leaders of the Trojans along with himself, and\nthe people followed them as sheep follow the ram when they go down to drink after they have been feeding, and the\nheart of the shepherd is glad\u2014even so was the heart of Aeneas gladdened when he saw his people follow him.\nThen they fought furiously in close combat about the body of Alcathous, wielding their long spears; and the\nbronze armour about their bodies rang fearfully as they took aim at one another in the press of the fight, while\nthe two heroes Aeneas and Idomeneus, peers of Mars, outxied every one in their desire to hack at each other with\nsword and spear. Aeneas took aim first, but Idomeneus was on the lookout and avoided the spear, so that it sped\nfrom Aeneas\u2019 strong hand in vain, and fell quivering in the ground. Idomeneus meanwhile smote Oenomaus in the\nmiddle of his belly, and broke the plate of his corslet, whereon his bowels came gushing out and he clutched the\nearth in the palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. Idomeneus drew his spear out of the body, but could\nnot strip him of the rest of his armour for the rain of darts that were showered upon him: moreover his strength\nwas now beginning to fail him so that he could no longer charge, and could neither spring forward to recover his\nown weapon nor swerve aside to avoid one that was aimed at him; therefore, though he still defended himself in\nhand-to-hand fight, his heavy feet could not bear him swiftly out of the battle. Deiphobus aimed a spear at him as\nhe was retreating slowly from the field, for his bitterness against him was as fierce as ever, but again he missed him,\nand hit Ascalaphus, the son of Mars; the spear went through his shoulder, and he clutched the earth in the palms of\nhis hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.\nGrim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had fallen, for he was sitting on the summits of Olym-\npus under the golden clouds, by command of Jove, where the other gods were also sitting, forbidden to take part\nin the battle. Meanwhile men fought furiously about the body. Deiphobus tore the helmet from off his head, but\nMeriones sprang upon him, and struck him on the arm with a spear so that the visored helmet fell from his hand\nand came ringing down upon the ground. Thereon Meriones sprang upon him like a vulture, drew the spear from\nhis shoulder, and fell back under cover of his men. Then Polites, own brother of Deiphobus passed his arms around\nhis waist, and bore him away from the battle till he got to his horses that were standing in the rear of the fight with\nthe chariot and their driver. These took him towards the city groaning and in great pain, with the blood flowing\nfrom his arm.\nThe others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven without ceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of\nCaletor, and struck him with a spear in his throat which was turned towards him; his head fell on one side, his hel-\nmet and shield came down along with him, and death, life\u2019s foe, was shed around him. Antilochus spied his chance,\nflew forward towards Thoon, and wounded him as he was turning round. He laid open the vein that runs all the\nway up the back to the neck; he cut this vein clean away throughout its whole course, and Thoon fell in the dust face\nupwards, stretching out his hands imploringly towards his comrades. Antilochus sprang upon him and stripped\nthe armour from his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so. The Trojans came about him on every side\nand struck his broad and gleaming shield, but could not wound his body, for Neptune stood guard over the son\nof Nestor, though the darts fell thickly round him. He was never clear of the foe, but was always in the thick of the\nfight; his spear was never idle; he poised and aimed it in every direction, so eager was he to hit some one from a\ndistance or to fight him hand to hand.\nAs he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas son of Asius, who rushed towards him and\n170 The Iliad\nstruck him with a spear in the middle of his shield, but Neptune made its point without effect, for he grudged him\nthe life of Antilochus. One half, therefore, of the spear stuck fast like a charred stake in Antilochus\u2019s shield, while\nthe other lay on the ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover of his men, but Meriones followed after\nand hit him with a spear midway between the private parts and the navel, where a wound is particualrly painful\nto wretched mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and he writhed convulsively about the spear as some bull\nwhom mountain herdsmen have bound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce. Even so did he move\nconvulsively for a while, but not for very long, till Meriones came up and drew the spear out of his body, and his\neyes were veiled in darkness.\nHelenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hitting him on the temple in close combat and tear-\ning the helmet from his head; the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were fighting on the Achaean side\ntook charge of it as it rolled at his feet, but the eyes of Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.\nOn this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards Helenus, brandishing his spear; but Helenus\ndrew his bow, and the two attacked one another at one and the same moment, the one with his spear, and the other\nwith his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hit the breastplate of Menelaus\u2019s corslet, but the arrow glanced from off\nit. As black beans or pulse come pattering down on to a threshing-floor from the broad winnowing-shovel, blown\nby shrill winds and shaken by the shovel\u2014even so did the arrow glance off and recoil from the shield of Menelaus,\nwho in his turn wounded the hand with which Helenus carried his bow; the spear went right through his hand and\nstuck in the bow itself, so that to his life he retreated under cover of his men, with his hand dragging by his side\u2014\nfor the spear weighed it down till Agenor drew it out and bound the hand carefully up in a woollen sling which his\nesquire had with him.\nPisander then made straight at Menelaus\u2014his evil destiny luring him on to his doom, for he was to fall in fight\nwith you, O Menelaus. When the two were hard by one another the spear of the son of Atreus turned aside and he\nmissed his aim; Pisander then struck the shield of brave Menelaus but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed the\nspear and broke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure of victory; forthwith, however, the son of Atreus\ndrew his sword and sprang upon him. Pisander then seized the bronze battle-axe, with its long and polished handle\nof olive wood that hung by his side under his shield, and the two made at one another. Pisander struck the peak\nof Menelaus\u2019s crested helmet just under the crest itself, and Menelaus hit Pisander as he was coming towards him,\non the forehead, just at the rise of his nose; the bones cracked and his two gore-bedrabbled eyes fell by his feet in\nthe dust. He fell backwards to the ground, and Menelaus set his heel upon him, stripped him of his armour, and\nvaunted over him saying, \u201cEven thus shall you Trojans leave the ships of the Achaeans, proud and insatiate of battle\nthough you be: nor shall you lack any of the disgrace and shame which you have heaped upon myself. Cowardly\nshe-wolves that you are, you feared not the anger of dread Jove, avenger of violated hospitality, who will one day\ndestroy your city; you stole my wedded wife and wickedly carried off much treasure when you were her guest, and\nnow you would fling fire upon our ships, and kill our heroes. A day will come when, rage as you may, you shall be\nstayed. O father Jove, you, who they say art above all both gods and men in wisdom, and from whom all things that\nbefall us do proceed, how can you thus favour the Trojans\u2014men so proud and overweening, that they are never\ntired of fighting? All things pall after a while\u2014sleep, love, sweet song, and stately dance\u2014still these are things of\nwhich a man would surely have his fill rather than of battle, whereas it is of battle that the Trojans are insatiate.\u201d\nSo saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the body of Pisander, and handed it over to his\nmen; then he again ranged himself among those who were in the front of the fight.\nHarpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had come to fight at Troy along with his father,\nbut he did not go home again. He struck the middle of Menelaus\u2019s shield with his spear but could not pierce it, and\nto save his life drew back under cover of his men, looking round him on every side lest he should be wounded.\nBut Meriones aimed a bronze-tipped arrow at him as he was leaving the field, and hit him on the right buttock;\nthe arrow pierced the bone through and through, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat down where he was and\nbreathed his last in the arms of his comrades, stretched like a worm upon the ground and watering the earth with\nthe blood that flowed from his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended him with all due care; they raised him into\nhis chariot, and bore him sadly off to the city of Troy; his father went also with him weeping bitterly, but there was\nno ransom that could bring his dead son to life again.\nParis was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his host when he went among the Paphlagonians;\nhe aimed an arrow, therefore, in order to avenge him. Now there was a certain man named Euchenor, son of Poly-\nidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was in Corinth. This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well\nknowing that it would be the death of him, for his good old father Polyidus had often told him that he must either\nstay at home and die of a terrible disease, or go with the Achaeans and perish at the hands of the Trojans; he chose,\ntherefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine the Achaeans would have laid upon him, and at the same time to escape\nthe pain and suffering of disease. Paris now smote him on the jaw under his ear, whereon the life went out of him\nand he was enshrouded in the darkness of death.\n171 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector had not yet heard, and did not know that the\nArgives were making havoc of his men on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere long would have\ntriumphed over them, so vigorously did Neptune cheer them on and help them. He therefore held on at the point\nwhere he had first forced his way through the gates and the wall, after breaking through the serried ranks of Da-\nnaan warriors. It was here that the ships of Ajax and Protesilaus were drawn up by the sea-shore; here the wall was\nat its lowest, and the fight both of man and horse raged most fiercely. The Boeotians and the Ionians with their long\ntunics, the Locrians, the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeans could hardly stay Hector as he rushed\non towards the ships, nor could they drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. The chosen men of the Athe-\nnians were in the van, led by Menestheus son of Peteos, with whom were also Pheidas, Stichius, and stalwart Bias:\nMeges son of Phyleus, Amphion, and Dracius commanded the Epeans, while Medon and staunch Podarces led the\nmen of Phthia. Of these, Medon was bastard son to Oileus and brother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from\nhis own country, for he had killed the brother of his stepmother Eriopis, the wife of Oileus; the other, Podarces, was\nthe son of Iphiclus son of Phylacus. These two stood in the van of the Phthians, and defended the ships along with\nthe Boeotians.\nAjax son of Oileus never for a moment left the side of Ajax son of Telamon, but as two swart oxen both strain\ntheir utmost at the plough which they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat steams upwards from about the\nroots of their horns\u2014nothing but the yoke divides them as they break up the ground till they reach the end of the\nfield\u2014even so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to shoulder by one another. Many and brave comrades followed\nthe son of Telamon, to relieve him of his shield when he was overcome with sweat and toil, but the Locrians did\nnot follow so close after the son of Oileus, for they could not hold their own in a hand-to-hand fight. They had no\nbronze helmets with plumes of horse-hair, neither had they shields nor ashen spears, but they had come to Troy\narmed with bows, and with slings of twisted wool from which they showered their missiles to break the ranks of the\nTrojans. The others, therefore, with their heavy armour bore the brunt of the fight with the Trojans and with Hector,\nwhile the Locrians shot from behind, under their cover; and thus the Trojans began to lose heart, for the arrows\nthrew them into confusion.\nThe Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the ships and tents back to windy Ilius, had not\nPolydamas presently said to Hector, \u201cHector, there is no persuading you to take advice. Because heaven has so rich-\nly endowed you with the arts of war, you think that you must therefore excel others in counsel; but you cannot thus\nclaim preeminence in all things. Heaven has made one man an excellent soldier; of another it has made a dancer\nor a singer and player on the lyre; while yet in another Jove has implanted a wise understanding of which men reap\nfruit to the saving of many, and he himself knows more about it than any one; therefore I will say what I think will\nbe best. The fight has hemmed you in as with a circle of fire, and even now that the Trojans are within the wall some\nof them stand aloof in full armour, while others are fighting scattered and outnumbered near the ships. Draw back,\ntherefore, and call your chieftains round you, that we may advise together whether to fall now upon the ships in\nthe hope that heaven may vouchsafe us victory, or to beat a retreat while we can yet safely do so. I greatly fear that\nthe Achaeans will pay us their debt of yesterday in full, for there is one abiding at their ships who is never weary of\nbattle, and who will not hold aloof much longer.\u201d\nThus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He sprang in full armour from his chariot and said,\n\u201cPolydamas, gather the chieftains here; I will go yonder into the fight, but will return at once when I have given\nthem their orders.\u201d\nHe then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a loud cry flew through the ranks of the\nTrojans and their allies. When they heard his voice they all hastened to gather round Polydamas the excellent son of\nPanthous, but Hector kept on among the foremost, looking everywhere to find Deiphobus and prince Helenus, Ad-\namas son of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus; living, indeed, and scatheless he could no longer find them, for the\ntwo last were lying by the sterns of the Achaean ships, slain by the Argives, while the others had been also stricken\nand wounded by them; but upon the left wing of the dread battle he found Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen,\ncheering his men and urging them on to fight. He went up to him and upbraided him. \u201cParis,\u201d said he, \u201cevil-hearted\nParis, fair to see but woman-mad and false of tongue, where are Deiphobus and King Helenus? Where are Adamas\nson of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus? Where too is Othryoneus? Ilius is undone and will now surely fall!\u201d\nAlexandrus answered, \u201cHector, why find fault when there is no one to find fault with? I should hold aloof from\nbattle on any day rather than this, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward about me. From the moment\nwhen you set our men fighting about the ships we have been staying here and doing battle with the Danaans. Our\ncomrades about whom you ask me are dead; Deiphobus and King Helenus alone have left the field, wounded both\nof them in the hand, but the son of Saturn saved them alive. Now, therefore, lead on where you would have us go,\nand we will follow with right goodwill; you shall not find us fail you in so far as our strength holds out, but no man\ncan do more than in him lies, no matter how willing he may be.\u201d\nWith these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went towards the part of the battle where the fight was\n172 The Iliad\nthickest, about Cebriones, brave Polydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike Polyphetes, Palmys, Ascanius, and Morys\nson of Hippotion, who had come from fertile Ascania on the preceding day to relieve other troops. Then Jove urged\nthem on to fight. They flew forth like the blasts of some fierce wind that strike earth in the van of a thunderstorm\u2014\nthey buffet the salt sea into an uproar; many and mighty are the great waves that come crashing in one after the\nother upon the shore with their arching heads all crested with foam\u2014even so did rank behind rank of Trojans ar-\nrayed in gleaming armour follow their leaders onward. The way was led by Hector son of Priam, peer of murderous\nMars, with his round shield before him\u2014his shield of ox-hides covered with plates of bronze\u2014and his gleaming\nhelmet upon his temples. He kept stepping forward under cover of his shield in every direction, making trial of the\nranks to see if they would give way be him, but he could not daunt the courage of the Achaeans. Ajax was the first\nto stride out and challenge him. \u201cSir,\u201d he cried, \u201cdraw near; why do you think thus vainly to dismay the Argives? We\nAchaeans are excellent soldiers, but the scourge of Jove has fallen heavily upon us. Your heart, forsooth, is set on\ndestroying our ships, but we too have bands that can keep you at bay, and your own fair town shall be sooner taken\nand sacked by ourselves. The time is near when you shall pray Jove and all the gods in your flight, that your steeds\nmay be swifter than hawks as they raise the dust on the plain and bear you back to your city.\u201d\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and the host of the Achaeans shouted, for they took\nheart at the omen. But Hector answered, \u201cAjax, braggart and false of tongue, would that I were as sure of being son\nfor evermore to aegis-bearing Jove, with Queen Juno for my mother, and of being held in like honour with Minerva\nand Apollo, as I am that this day is big with the destruction of the Achaeans; and you shall fall among them if you\ndare abide my spear; it shall rend your fair body and bid you glut our hounds and birds of prey with your fat and\nyour flesh, as you fall by the ships of the Achaeans.\u201d\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after with a cry that rent the air, while the host shout-\ned behind them. The Argives on their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget their prowess, but stood firm\nagainst the onslaught of the Trojan chieftains, and the cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and to the bright-\nness of Jove\u2019s presence.\nBook XIV\nNESTOR was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not escape him, and he said to the son of Aescula-\npius, \u201cWhat, noble Machaon, is the meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting by our ships grow stronger and\nstronger; stay here, therefore, and sit over your wine, while fair Hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clotted\nblood from off you. I will go at once to the look-out station and see what it is all about.\u201d\nAs he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that was lying in his tent, all gleaming with bronze,\nfor Thrasymedes had taken his father\u2019s shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and as soon as he was\noutside saw the disastrous rout of the Achaeans who, now that their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell be-\nfore the Trojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the waves are dumb\u2014they keep their eyes on the\nwatch for the quarter whence the fierce winds may spring upon them, but they stay where they are and set neither\nthis way nor that, till some particular wind sweeps down from heaven to determine them\u2014even so did the old man\nponder whether to make for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search of Agamemnon. In the end he deemed it best to\ngo to the son of Atreus; but meanwhile the hosts were fighting and killing one another, and the hard bronze rattled\non their bodies, as they thrust at one another with their swords and spears.\nThe wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon son of Atreus, fell in Nestor as they were\ncoming up from their ships\u2014for theirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting was going on, being on\nthe shore itself inasmuch as they had been beached first, while the wall had been built behind the hindermost. The\nstretch of the shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all the ships, and the host was cramped for space,\ntherefore they had placed the ships in rows one behind the other, and had filled the whole opening of the bay be-\ntween the two points that formed it. The kings, leaning on their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being\nin great anxiety, and when old Nestor met them they were filled with dismay. Then King Agamemnon said to him,\n\u201cNestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? I fear that what\ndread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted among the Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till\nhe had fired our ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is all coming true. Alas! others of the Achaeans,\nlike Achilles, are in anger with me that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our ships.\u201d\nThen Nestor knight of Gerene answered, \u201cIt is indeed as you say; it is all coming true at this moment, and even\nJove who thunders from on high cannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we relied as an impregnable bulwark\nboth for us and our fleet. The Trojans are fighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look where you may\nyou cannot see from what quarter the rout of the Achaeans is coming; they are being killed in a confused mass\nand the battle-cry ascends to heaven; let us think, if counsel can be of any use, what we had better do; but I do not\nadvise our going into battle ourselves, for a man cannot fight when he is wounded.\u201d\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \u201cNestor, if the Trojans are indeed fighting at the rear of our ships, and neither\n173 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthe wall nor the trench has served us\u2014over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which they deemed would be\nan impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet\u2014I see it must be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perish\ningloriously here, far from Argos. I knew when Jove was willing to defend us, and I know now that he is raising the\nTrojans to like honour with the gods, while us, on the other hand, he bas bound hand and foot. Now, therefore, let\nus all do as I say; let us bring down the ships that are on the beach and draw them into the water; let us make them\nfast to their mooring-stones a little way out, against the fall of night\u2014if even by night the Trojans will desist from\nfighting; we may then draw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong in flying ruin even by night. It is bet-\nter for a man that he should fly and be saved than be caught and killed.\u201d\nUlysses looked fiercely at him and said, \u201cSon of Atreus, what are you talking about? Wretch, you should have\ncommanded some other and baser army, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has allotted a life of hard fighting\nfrom youth to old age, till we every one of us perish. Is it thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to win which we\nhave suffered so much hardship? Hold your peace, lest some other of the Achaeans hear you say what no man who\nknows how to give good counsel, no king over so great a host as that of the Argives should ever have let fall from his\nlips. I despise your judgement utterly for what you have been saying. Would you, then, have us draw down our ships\ninto the water while the battle is raging, and thus play further into the hands of the conquering Trojans? It would be\nruin; the Achaeans will not go on fighting when they see the ships being drawn into the water, but will cease attack-\ning and keep turning their eyes towards them; your counsel, therefore, Sir captain, would be our destruction.\u201d\nAgamemnon answered, \u201cUlysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart. I am not, however, ordering the\nAchaeans to draw their ships into the sea whether they will or no. Some one, it may be, old or young, can offer us\nbetter counsel which I shall rejoice to hear.\u201d\nThen said Diomed, \u201cSuch an one is at hand; he is not far to seek, if you will listen to me and not resent my\nspeaking though I am younger than any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who lies buried at The-\nbes. For Portheus had three noble sons, two of whom, Agrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The\nthird was the knight Oeneus, my father\u2019s father, and he was the most valiant of them all. Oeeneus remained in his\nown country, but my father (as Jove and the other gods ordained it) migrated to Argos. He married into the fami-\nly of Adrastus, and his house was one of great abundance, for he had large estates of rich corn-growing land, with\nmuch orchard ground as well, and he had many sheep; moreover he excelled all the Argives in the use of the spear.\nYou must yourselves have heard whether these things are true or no; therefore when I say well despise not my words\nas though I were a coward or of ignoble birth. I say, then, let us go to the fight as we needs must, wounded though\nwe be. When there, we may keep out of the battle and beyond the range of the spears lest we get fresh wounds in\naddition to what we have already, but we can spur on others, who have been indulging their spleen and holding\naloof from battle hitherto.\u201d\nThus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out, King Agamemnon leading the way.\nMeanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them in the semblance of an old man. He\ntook Agamemnon\u2019s right hand in his own and said, \u201cSon of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that he sees the\nAchaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse\u2014may he come to a bad end and heaven confound\nhim. As for yourself, the blessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that the princes and counsellors of\nthe Trojans shall again raise the dust upon the plain, and you shall see them flying from the ships and tents towards\ntheir city.\u201d\nWith this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to the plain. The voice that came from his deep\nchest was as that of nine or ten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight, and it put fresh cour-\nage into the hearts of the Achaeans to wage war and do battle without ceasing.\nJuno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak of Olympus and her heart was gladdened at\nthe sight of him who was at once her brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thither amid the fighting.\nThen she turned her eyes to Jove as he sat on the topmost crests of many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She set\nherself to think how she might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemed that it would be best for her to go to Ida\nand array herself in rich attire, in the hope that Jove might become enamoured of her, and wish to embrace her.\nWhile he was thus engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be made to steal over his eyes and senses.\nShe went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had made her, and the doors of which he had cunningly\nfastened by means of a secret key so that no other god could open them. Here she entered and closed the doors be-\nhind her. She cleansed all the dirt from her fair body with ambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil, ambro-\nsial, very soft, and scented specially for herself\u2014if it were so much as shaken in the bronze-floored house of Jove,\nthe scent pervaded the universe of heaven and earth. With this she anointed her delicate skin, and then she plaited\nthe fair ambrosial locks that flowed in a stream of golden tresses from her immortal head. She put on the wondrous\nrobe which Minerva had worked for her with consummate art, and had embroidered with manifold devices; she\nfastened it about her bosom with golden clasps, and she girded herself with a girdle that had a hundred tassels: then\nshe fastened her earrings, three brilliant pendants that glistened most beautifully, through the pierced lobes of her\n174 The Iliad\nears, and threw a lovely new veil over her head. She bound her sandals on to her feet, and when she had arrayed\nherself perfectly to her satisfaction, she left her room and called Venus to come aside and speak to her. \u201cMy dear\nchild,\u201d said she, \u201cwill you do what I am going to ask of you, or will refuse me because you are angry at my being on\nthe Danaan side, while you are on the Trojan?\u201d\nJove\u2019s daughter Venus answered, \u201cJuno, august queen of goddesses, daughter of mighty Saturn, say what you\nwant, and I will do it for at once, if I can, and if it can be done at all.\u201d\nThen Juno told her a lying tale and said, \u201cI want you to endow me with some of those fascinating charms, the\nspells of which bring all things mortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the world\u2019s end to visit Oceanus\n(from whom all we gods proceed) and mother Tethys: they received me in their house, took care of me, and\nbrought me up, having taken me over from Rhaea when Jove imprisoned great Saturn in the depths that are under\nearth and sea. I must go and see them that I may make peace between them; they have been quarrelling, and are so\nangry that they have not slept with one another this long while; if I can bring them round and restore them to one\nanother\u2019s embraces, they will be grateful to me and love me for ever afterwards.\u201d\nThereon laughter-loving Venus said, \u201cI cannot and must not refuse you, for you sleep in the arms of Jove who is\nour king.\u201d\nAs she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered girdle into which all her charms had been\nwrought\u2014love, desire, and that sweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the most prudent. She gave the\ngirdle to Juno and said, \u201cTake this girdle wherein all my charms reside and lay it in your bosom. If you will wear it I\npromise you that your errand, be it what it may, will not be bootless.\u201d\nWhen she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the girdle in her bosom.\nVenus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted down from the summits of Olympus. She\npassed over Pieria and fair Emathia, and went on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of the Thracian horse-\nmen, over whose topmost crests she sped without ever setting foot to ground. When she came to Athos she went\non over the, waves of the sea till she reached Lemnos, the city of noble Thoas. There she met Sleep, own brother to\nDeath, and caught him by the hand, saying, \u201cSleep, you who lord it alike over mortals and immortals, if you ever\ndid me a service in times past, do one for me now, and I shall be grateful to you ever after. Close Jove\u2019s keen eyes for\nme in slumber while I hold him clasped in my embrace, and I will give you a beautiful golden seat, that can never\nfall to pieces; my clubfooted son Vulcan shall make it for you, and he shall give it a footstool for you to rest your fair\nfeet upon when you are at table.\u201d\nThen Sleep answered, \u201cJuno, great queen of goddesses, daughter of mighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the\ngods to sleep without compunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus from whom all of them proceed, but\nI dare not go near Jove, nor send him to sleep unless he bids me. I have had one lesson already through doing what\nyou asked me, on the day when Jove\u2019s mighty son Hercules set sail from Ilius after having sacked the city of the Tro-\njans. At your bidding I suffused my sweet self over the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and laid him to rest; meanwhile\nyou hatched a plot against Hercules, and set the blasts of the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took him to\nthe goodly city of Cos away from all his friends. Jove was furious when he awoke, and began hurling the gods about\nall over the house; he was looking more particularly for myself, and would have flung me down through space into\nthe sea where I should never have been heard of any more, had not Night who cows both men and gods protected\nme. I fled to her and Jove left off looking for me in spite of his being so angry, for he did not dare do anything to\ndisplease Night. And now you are again asking me to do something on which I cannot venture.\u201d\nAnd Juno said, \u201cSleep, why do you take such notions as those into your head? Do you think Jove will be as anx-\nious to help the Trojans, as he was about his own son? Come, I will marry you to one of the youngest of the Graces,\nand she shall be your own\u2014Pasithea, whom you have always wanted to marry.\u201d\nSleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, \u201cThen swear it to me by the dread waters of the river Styx;\nlay one hand on the bounteous earth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that all the gods who dwell down\nbelow with Saturn may be our witnesses, and see that you really do give me one of the youngest of the Graces\u2014Pa-\nsithea, whom I have always wanted to marry.\u201d\nJuno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of the nether world, who are called Titans, to wit-\nness. When she had completed her oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist and sped lightly forward,\nleaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them. Presently they reached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and\nLectum where they left the sea to go on by land, and the tops of the trees of the forest soughed under the going\nof their feet. Here Sleep halted, and ere Jove caught sight of him he climbed a lofty pine-tree \u2014 the tallest that\nreared its head towards heaven on all Ida. He hid himself behind the branches and sat there in the semblance of the\nsweet-singing bird that haunts the mountains and is called Chalcis by the gods, but men call it Cymindis. Juno then\nwent to Gargarus, the topmost peak of Ida, and Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon her. As soon as he did so he\nbecame inflamed with the same passionate desire for her that he had felt when they had first enjoyed each other\u2019s\nembraces, and slept with one another without their dear parents knowing anything about it. He went up to her and\n175 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you want that you have come hither from Olympus\u2014and that too with neither chariot nor horses to\nconvey you?\u201d\nThen Juno told him a lying tale and said, \u201cI am going to the world\u2019s end, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we\ngods proceed, and mother Tethys; they received me into their house, took care of me, and brought me up. I must go\nand see them that I may make peace between them: they have been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have not\nslept with one another this long time. The horses that will take me over land and sea are stationed on the lowermost\nspurs of many-fountained Ida, and I have come here from Olympus on purpose to consult you. I was afraid you\nmight be angry with me later on, if I went to the house of Oceanus without letting you know.\u201d\nAnd Jove said, \u201cJuno, you can choose some other time for paying your visit to Oceanus\u2014for the present let us\ndevote ourselves to love and to the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been so overpowered by passion\nneither for goddess nor mortal woman as I am at this moment for yourself\u2014not even when I was in love with the\nwife of Ixion who bore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet with Danae the daintily-ancled daughter of\nAcrisius, who bore me the famed hero Perseus. Then there was the daughter of Phoenix, who bore me Minos and\nRhadamanthus: there was Semele, and Alcmena in Thebes by whom I begot my lion-hearted son Hercules, while\nSemele became mother to Bacchus the comforter of mankind. There was queen Ceres again, and lovely Leto, and\nyourself\u2014but with none of these was I ever so much enamoured as I now am with you.\u201d\nJuno again answered him with a lying tale. \u201cMost dread son of Saturn,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cwhat are you talking\nabout? Would you have us enjoy one another here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything can be seen? What if\none of the ever-living gods should see us sleeping together, and tell the others? It would be such a scandal that when\nI had risen from your embraces I could never show myself inside your house again; but if you are so minded, there\nis a room which your son Vulcan has made me, and he has given it good strong doors; if you would so have it, let us\ngo thither and lie down.\u201d\nAnd Jove answered, \u201cJuno, you need not be afraid that either god or man will see you, for I will enshroud both\nof us in such a dense golden cloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beams shall not see through it.\u201d\nWith this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace; whereon the earth sprouted them a cushion of\nyoung grass, with dew-bespangled lotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick that it raised them well above the\nground. Here they laid themselves down and overhead they were covered by a fair cloud of gold, from which there\nfell glittering dew-drops.\nThus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the crest of Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love,\nand he held his spouse in his arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the Achaeans, to tell earth-encircling\nNeptune, lord of the earthquake. When he had found him he said, \u201cNow, Neptune, you can help the Danaans with a\nwill, and give them victory though it be only for a short time while Jove is still sleeping. I have sent him into a sweet\nslumber, and Juno has beguiled him into going to bed with her.\u201d\nSleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind, leaving Neptune more eager than ever to\nhelp the Danaans. He darted forward among the first ranks and shouted saying, \u201cArgives, shall we let Hector son of\nPriam have the triumph of taking our ships and covering himself with glory? This is what he says that he shall now\ndo, seeing that Achilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; We shall get on very well without him if we keep each other in\nheart and stand by one another. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us each take the best and largest shield we\ncan lay hold of, put on our helmets, and sally forth with our longest spears in our hands; will lead you on, and Hec-\ntor son of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold out against us. If any good staunch soldier has only a small\nshield, let him hand it over to a worse man, and take a larger one for himself.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon, wounded\nthough they were, set the others in array, and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges of armour; the most\nvaliant took the best armour, and gave the worse to the worse man. When they had donned their bronze armour\nthey marched on with Neptune at their head. In his strong hand he grasped his terrible sword, keen of edge and\nflashing like lightning; woe to him who comes across it in the day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away\nfrom it.\nHector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Neptune and Hector waged fierce war on one anoth-\ner\u2014Hector on the Trojan and Neptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as the two forces met; the sea\ncame rolling in towards the ships and tents of the Achaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly\nwhen driven before the blast of Boreas, nor do the flames of a forest fire roar more fiercely when it is well alight\nupon the mountains, nor does the wind bellow with ruder music as it tears on through the tops of when it is blow-\ning its hardest, than the terrible shout which the Trojans and Achaeans raised as they sprang upon one another.\nHector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards him, nor did he miss his aim. The spear struck\nhim where two bands passed over his chest\u2014the band of his shield and that of his silver-studded sword\u2014and these\nprotected his body. Hector was angry that his spear should have been hurled in vain, and withdrew under cover of\nhis men. As he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamon struck him with a stone, of which there were many lying\n176 The Iliad\nabout under the men\u2019s feet as they fought\u2014brought there to give support to the ships\u2019 sides as they lay on the shore.\nAjax caught up one of them and struck Hector above the rim of his shield close to his neck; the blow made him\nspin round like a top and reel in all directions. As an oak falls headlong when uprooted by the lightning flash of\nfather Jove, and there is a terrible smell of brimstone\u2014no man can help being dismayed if he is standing near it, for\na thunderbolt is a very awful thing\u2014even so did Hector fall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell from his hand,\nbut his shield and helmet were made fast about his body, and his bronze armour rang about him.\nThe sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him, hoping to drag him away, and they\nshowered their darts on the Trojans, but none of them could wound him before he was surrounded and covered\nby the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon captain of the Lycians, and noble Glaucus: of the others, too,\nthere was not one who was unmindful of him, and they held their round shields over him to cover him. His com-\nrades then lifted him off the ground and bore him away from the battle to the place where his horses stood waiting\nfor him at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot; these then took him towards the city groaning and\nin great pain. When they reached the ford of the air stream of Xanthus, begotten of Immortal Jove, they took him\nfrom off his chariot and laid him down on the ground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he breathed\nagain and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he vomited blood, but soon fell back on to the ground, and\nhis eyes were again closed in darkness for he was still sturined by the blow.\nWhen the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart and set upon the Trojans yet more furiously.\nAjax fleet son of Oileus began by springing on Satnius son of Enops and wounding him with his spear: a fair naiad\nnymph had borne him to Enops as he was herding cattle by the banks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus came\nup to him and struck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fierce fight between Trojans and Danaans raged round\nhis body. Polydamas son of Panthous drew near to avenge him, and wounded Prothoenor son of Areilycus on the\nright shoulder; the terrible spear went right through his shoulder, and he clutched the earth as he fell in the dust.\nPolydamas vaunted loudly over him saying, \u201cAgain I take it that the spear has not sped in vain from the strong hand\nof the son of Panthous; an Argive has caught it in his body, and it will serve him for a staff as he goes down into the\nhouse of Hades.\u201d\nThe Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamon was more angry than any, for the man\nhad fallen close be, him; so he aimed at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself by swerving\naside and the spear struck Archelochus son of Antenor, for heaven counselled his destruction; it struck him where\nthe head springs from the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severed both the tendons at the back of the head.\nHis head, mouth, and nostrils reached the ground long before his legs and knees could do so, and Ajax shouted to\nPolydamas saying, \u201cThink, Polydamas, and tell me truly whether this man is not as well worth killing as Prothoenor\nwas: he seems rich, and of rich family, a brother, it may be, or son of the knight Antenor, for he is very like him.\u201d\nBut he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly angered. Acamas then bestrode his brother\u2019s body\nand wounded Promachus the Boeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother\u2019s body away. Acamas\nvaunted loudly over him saying, \u201cArgive archers, braggarts that you are, toil and suffering shall not be for us only,\nbut some of you too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See how Promachus now sleeps, vanquished by my spear;\npayment for my brother\u2019s blood has not long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankful if he leaves a kinsman\nin his house behind him to avenge his fall.\u201d\nHis taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged than any of them. He sprang towards Acam-\nas, but Acamas did not stand his ground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-master Phorbas, whom Mer-\ncury had favoured and endowed with greater wealth than any other of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and\nPeneleos now wounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball from its socket: the spear went right\nthrough the eye into the nape of the neck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him. Peneleos then drew his\nsword and smote him on the neck, so that both head and helmet came tumbling down to the ground with the spear\nstill sticking in the eye; he then held up the head, as though it had been a poppy-head, and showed it to the Trojans,\nvaunting over them as he did so. \u201cTrojans,\u201d he cried, \u201cbid the father and mother of noble Ilioneus make moan for\nhim in their house, for the wife also of Promachus son of Alegenor will never be gladdened by the coming of her\ndear husband\u2014when we Argives return with our ships from Troy.\u201d\nAs he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about to see whither he might fly for safety.\nTell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of the Argives to bear away blood-stained\nspoils after Neptune lord of the earthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon was first to wound\nHyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the staunch Mysians. Antilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones\nslew Morys and Hippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The son of Atreus then wounded Hyper-\nenor shepherd of his people, in the flank, and the bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in among them;\non this his life came hurrying out of him at the place where he had been wounded, and his eyes were closed in dark-\nness. Ajax son of Oileus killed more than any other, for there was no man so fleet as he to pursue flying foes when\nJove had spread panic among them.\n177 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nBook XV\nBUT when their flight had taken them past the trench and the set stakes, and many had fallen by the hands of\nthe Danaans, the Trojans made a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear. Jove now woke on the\ncrests of Ida, where he was lying with golden-throned Juno by his side, and starting to his feet he saw the Trojans\nand Achaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and the others driving them pell-mell before them with King Nep-\ntune in their midst. He saw Hector lying on the ground with his comrades gathered round him, gasping for breath,\nwandering in mind and vomiting blood, for it was not the feeblest of the Achaeans who struck him.\nThe sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on Juno. \u201cI see, Juno,\u201d said he, \u201cyou mischief\u2014\nmaking trickster, that your cunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused the rout of his host. I am in\nhalf a mind to thrash you, in which case you will be the first to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you not\nremember how once upon a time I had you hanged? I fastened two anvils on to your feet, and bound your hands in\na chain of gold which none might break, and you hung in mid-air among the clouds. All the gods in Olympus were\nin a fury, but they could not reach you to set you free; when I caught any one of them I gripped him and hurled him\nfrom the heavenly threshold till he came fainting down to earth; yet even this did not relieve my mind from the\nincessant anxiety which I felt about noble Hercules whom you and Boreas had spitefully conveyed beyond the seas\nto Cos, after suborning the tempests; but I rescued him, and notwithstanding all his mighty labours I brought him\nback again to Argos. I would remind you of this that you may learn to leave off being so deceitful, and discover how\nmuch you are likely to gain by the embraces out of which you have come here to trick me.\u201d\nJuno trembled as he spoke, and said, \u201cMay heaven above and earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of\nthe river Styx\u2014and this is the most solemn oath that a blessed god can take\u2014nay, I swear also by your own al-\nmighty head and by our bridal bed\u2014things over which I could never possibly perjure myself\u2014that Neptune is not\npunishing Hector and the Trojans and helping the Achaeans through any doing of mine; it is all of his own mere\nmotion because he was sorry to see the Achaeans hard pressed at their ships: if I were advising him, I should tell\nhim to do as you bid him.\u201d\nThe sire of gods and men smiled and answered, \u201cIf you, Juno, were always to support me when we sit in coun-\ncil of the gods, Neptune, like it or no, would soon come round to your and my way of thinking. If, then, you are\nspeaking the truth and mean what you say, go among the rank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and Apollo lord of\nthe bow, that I want them \u2014 Iris, that she may go to the Achaean host and tell Neptune to leave off fighting and\ngo home, and Apollo, that he may send Hector again into battle and give him fresh strength; he will thus forget his\npresent sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back in confusion till they fall among the ships of Achilles son of Pele-\nus. Achilles will then send his comrade Patroclus into battle, and Hector will kill him in front of Ilius after he has\nslain many warriors, and among them my own noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will kill Hector to avenge Patroclus,\nand from that time I will bring it about that the Achaeans shall persistently drive the Trojans back till they fulfil the\ncounsels of Minerva and take Ilius. But I will not stay my anger, nor permit any god to help the Danaans till I have\naccomplished the desire of the son of Peleus, according to the promise I made by bowing my head on the day when\nThetis touched my knees and besought me to give him honour.\u201d\nJuno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to great Olympus. Swift as the thought of one whose\nfancy carries him over vast continents, and he says to himself, \u201cNow I will be here, or there,\u201d and he would have all\nmanner of things\u2014even so swiftly did Juno wing her way till she came to high Olympus and went in among the\ngods who were gathered in the house of Jove. When they saw her they all of them came up to her, and held out their\ncups to her by way of greeting. She let the others be, but took the cup offered her by lovely Themis, who was first to\ncome running up to her. \u201cJuno,\u201d said she, \u201cwhy are you here? And you seem troubled\u2014has your husband the son of\nSaturn been frightening you?\u201d\nAnd Juno answered, \u201cThemis, do not ask me about it. You know what a proud and cruel disposition my hus-\nband has. Lead the gods to table, where you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designs which he has\navowed. Many a one, mortal and immortal, will be angered by them, however peaceably he may be feasting now.\u201d\nOn this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the house of Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but\nher brow was furrowed with care, and she spoke up in a rage. \u201cFools that we are,\u201d she cried, \u201cto be thus madly angry\nwith Jove; we keep on wanting to go up to him and stay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof and cares\nfor nobody, for he knows that he is much stronger than any other of the immortals. Make the best, therefore, of\nwhatever ills he may choose to send each one of you; Mars, I take it, has had a taste of them already, for his son As-\ncalaphus has fallen in battle\u2014the man whom of all others he loved most dearly and whose father he owns himself\nto be.\u201d\nWhen he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat of his hands, and said in anger, \u201cDo not\nblame me, you gods that dwell in heaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge the death of my son, even\n178 The Iliad\nthough it end in my being struck by Jove\u2019s lightning and lying in blood and dust among the corpses.\u201d\nAs he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout, while he put on his armour. On this, Jove would\nhave been roused to still more fierce and implacable enmity against the other immortals, had not Minerva, ararmed\nfor the safety of the gods, sprung from her seat and hurried outside. She tore the helmet from his head and the\nshield from his shoulders, and she took the bronze spear from his strong hand and set it on one side; then she said\nto Mars, \u201cMadman, you are undone; you have ears that hear not, or you have lost all judgement and understanding;\nhave you not heard what Juno has said on coming straight from the presence of Olympian Jove? Do you wish to go\nthrough all kinds of suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry to Olympus, after having caused infinite\nmischief to all us others? Jove would instantly leave the Trojans and Achaeans to themselves; he would come to\nOlympus to punish us, and would grip us up one after another, guilty or not guilty. Therefore lay aside your anger\nfor the death of your son; better men than he have either been killed already or will fall hereafter, and one cannot\nprotect every one\u2019s whole family.\u201d\nWith these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Juno called Apollo outside, with Iris the messenger\nof the gods. \u201cJove,\u201d she said to them, \u201cdesires you to go to him at once on Mt. Ida; when you have seen him you are\nto do as he may then bid you.\u201d\nThereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris and Apollo made all haste on their way. When\nthey reached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove seated on topmost Gargarus with a fra-\ngrant cloud encircling his head as with a diadem. They stood before his presence, and he was pleased with them for\nhaving been so quick in obeying the orders his wife had given them.\nHe spoke to Iris first. \u201cGo,\u201d said he, \u201cfleet Iris, tell King Neptune what I now bid you\u2014and tell him true. Bid him\nleave off fighting, and either join the company of the gods, or go down into the sea. If he takes no heed and disobeys\nme, let him consider well whether he is strong enough to hold his own against me if I attack him. I am older and\nmuch stronger than he is; yet he is not afraid to set himself up as on a level with myself, of whom all the other gods\nstand in awe.\u201d\nIris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or snowflakes that fly from out the clouds before the\nblast of Boreas, even so did she wing her way till she came close up to the great shaker of the earth. Then she said, \u201cI\nhave come, O dark-haired king that holds the world in his embrace, to bring you a message from Jove. He bids you\nleave off fighting, and either join the company of the gods or go down into the sea; if, however, you take no heed\nand disobey him, he says he will come down here and fight you. He would have you keep out of his reach, for he\nis older and much stronger than you are, and yet you are not afraid to set yourself up as on a level with himself, of\nwhom all the other gods stand in awe.\u201d\nNeptune was very angry and said, \u201cGreat heavens! strong as Jove may be, he has said more than he can do if he\nhas threatened violence against me, who am of like honour with himself. We were three brothers whom Rhea bore\nto Saturn\u2014Jove, myself, and Hades who rules the world below. Heaven and earth were divided into three parts, and\neach of us was to have an equal share. When we cast lots, it fell to me to have my dwelling in the sea for evermore;\nHades took the darkness of the realms under the earth, while air and sky and clouds were the portion that fell to\nJove; but earth and great Olympus are the common property of all. Therefore I will not walk as Jove would have me.\nFor all his strength, let him keep to his own third share and be contented without threatening to lay hands upon me\nas though I were nobody. Let him keep his bragging talk for his own sons and daughters, who must perforce obey\nhim.\nIris fleet as the wind then answered, \u201cAm I really, Neptune, to take this daring and unyielding message to Jove,\nor will you reconsider your answer? Sensible people are open to argument, and you know that the Erinyes always\nrange themselves on the side of the older person.\u201d\nNeptune answered, \u201cGoddess Iris, your words have been spoken in season. It is well when a messenger shows\nso much discretion. Nevertheless it cuts me to the very heart that any one should rebuke so angrily another who is\nhis own peer, and of like empire with himself. Now, however, I will give way in spite of my displeasure; furthermore\nlet me tell you, and I mean what I say\u2014if contrary to the desire of myself, Minerva driver of the spoil, Juno, Mer-\ncury, and King Vulcan, Jove spares steep Ilius, and will not let the Achaeans have the great triumph of sacking it, let\nhim understand that he will incur our implacable resentment.\u201d\nNeptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely did the Achaeans miss him. Then Jove said to\nApollo, \u201cGo, dear Phoebus, to Hector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his embrace has now gone down under\nthe sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure. Had he not done so those gods who are below with Saturn would\nhave come to hear of the fight between us. It is better for both of us that he should have curbed his anger and kept\nout of my reach, for I should have had much trouble with him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis, and shake it furious-\nly, so as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic; take, moreover, brave Hector, O Far-Darter, into your own care, and\nrouse him to deeds of daring, till the Achaeans are sent flying back to their ships and to the Hellespont. From that\npoint I will think it well over, how the Achaeans may have a respite from their troubles.\u201d\n179 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nApollo obeyed his father\u2019s saying, and left the crests of Ida, flying like a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all\nbirds. He found Hector no longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for he had just come to himself again. He\nknew those who were about him, and the sweat and hard breathing had left him from the moment when the will of\naegis-bearing Jove had revived him. Apollo stood beside him and said, \u201cHector, son of Priam, why are you so faint,\nand why are you here away from the others? Has any mishap befallen you?\u201d\nHector in a weak voice answered, \u201cAnd which, kind sir, of the gods are you, who now ask me thus? Do you not\nknow that Ajax struck me on the chest with a stone as I was killing his comrades at the ships of the Achaeans, and\ncompelled me to leave off fighting? I made sure that this very day I should breathe my last and go down into the\nhouse of Hades.\u201d\nThen King Apollo said to him, \u201cTake heart; the son of Saturn has sent you a mighty helper from Ida to stand\nby you and defend you, even me, Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been guardian hitherto not only\nof yourself but of your city. Now, therefore, order your horsemen to drive their chariots to the ships in great multi-\ntudes. I will go before your horses to smooth the way for them, and will turn the Achaeans in flight.\u201d\nAs he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his people. And as a horse, stabled and full-fed,\nbreaks loose and gallops gloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to take his bath in the river\u2014he\ntosses his head, and his mane streams over his shoulders as in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed to the\npastures where the mares are feeding\u2014even so Hector, when he heard what the god said, urged his horsemen on,\nand sped forward as fast as his limbs could take him. As country peasants set their hounds on to a homed stag or\nwild goat\u2014he has taken shelter under rock or thicket, and they cannot find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom their\nshouts have roused stands in their path, and they are in no further humour for the chase\u2014even so the Achaeans\nwere still charging on in a body, using their swords and spears pointed at both ends, but when they saw Hector\ngoing about among his men they were afraid, and their hearts fell down into their feet.\nThen spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a man who could throw a good throw, and who\nwas staunch also in close fight, while few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided. He then with\nall sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: \u201cWhat, in heaven\u2019s name, do I now see? Is it not Hector come to\nlife again? Every one made sure he had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, but it seems that one of the gods has\nagain rescued him. He has killed many of us Danaans already, and I take it will yet do so, for the hand of Jove must\nbe with him or he would never dare show himself so masterful in the forefront of the battle. Now, therefore, let us\nall do as I say; let us order the main body of our forces to fall back upon the ships, but let those of us who profess\nto be the flower of the army stand firm, and see whether we cannot hold Hector back at the point of our spears as\nsoon as he comes near us; I conceive that he will then think better of it before he tries to charge into the press of the\nDanaans.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those who were about Ajax and King Idomeneus, the\nfollowers moreover of Teucer, Meriones, and Meges peer of Mars called all their best men about them and sustained\nthe fight against Hector and the Trojans, but the main body fell back upon the ships of the Achaeans.\nThe Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding on at their head. Before him went Phoebus\nApollo shrouded in cloud about his shoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with its shaggy fringe, which Vulcan\nthe smith had given Jove to strike terror into the hearts of men. With this in his hand he led on the Trojans.\nThe Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry of battle rose high from either side, and the arrows\nflew from the bowstrings. Many a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in the bodies of many a valiant war-\nrior, while others fell to earth midway, before they could taste of man\u2019s fair flesh and glut themselves with blood. So\nlong as Phoebus Apollo held his aegis quietly and without shaking it, the weapons on either side took effect and the\npeople fell, but when he shook it straight in the face of the Danaans and raised his mighty battle-cry their hearts\nfainted within them and they forgot their former prowess. As when two wild beasts spring in the dead of night on a\nherd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when the herdsman is not there\u2014even so were the Danaans struck helpless,\nfor Apollo filled them with panic and gave victory to Hector and the Trojans.\nThe fight then became more scattered and they killed one another where they best could. Hector killed Stichius\nand Arcesilaus, the one, leader of the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade of Menestheus. Aeneas killed\nMedon and Iasus. The first was bastard son to Oileus, and brother to Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from his\nown country, for he had killed a man, a kinsman of his stepmother Eriopis whom Oileus had married. Iasus had\nbecome a leader of the Athenians, and was son of Sphelus the son of Boucolos. Polydamas killed Mecisteus, and\nPolites Echius, in the front of the battle, while Agenor slew Clonius. Paris struck Deiochus from behind in the lower\npart of the shoulder, as he was flying among the foremost, and the point of the spear went clean through him.\nWhile they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the Achaeans were flying pellmell to the trench and the\nset stakes, and were forced back within their wall. Hector then cried out to the Trojans, \u201cForward to the ships, and\nlet the spoils be. If I see any man keeping back on the other side the wall away from the ships I will have him killed:\nhis kinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his dues of fire, but dogs shall tear him in pieces in front of our city.\u201d\n180 The Iliad\nAs he spoke he laid his whip about his horses\u2019 shoulders and called to the Trojans throughout their ranks; the\nTrojans shouted with a cry that rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck with his own. Phoebus Apollo went\nbefore, and kicked down the banks of the deep trench into its middle so as to make a great broad bridge, as broad\nas the throw of a spear when a man is trying his strength. The Trojan battalions poured over the bridge, and Apollo\nwith his redoubtable aegis led the way. He kicked down the wall of the Achaeans as easily as a child who playing on\nthe sea-shore has built a house of sand and then kicks it down again and destroys it\u2014even so did you, O Apollo,\nshed toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling them with panic and confusion.\nThus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out to one another and raising their hands with\nloud cries every man to heaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted up his hands to the\nstarry firmament of heaven, and prayed more fervently than any of them. \u201cFather Jove,\u201d said he, \u201cif ever any one in\nwheat-growing Argos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heifer and prayed that he might return safely home,\nwhereon you bowed your head to him in assent, bear it in mind now, and suffer not the Trojans to triumph thus\nover the Achaeans.\u201d\nAll counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to die prayer of the aged son of Neleus. When the heard Jove\nthunder they flung themselves yet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breaking over the bulwarks of a ship\nwhen the sea runs high before a gale\u2014for it is the force of the wind that makes the waves so great\u2014even so did the\nTrojans spring over the wall with a shout, and drive their chariots onwards. The two sides fought with their dou-\nble-pointed spears in hand-to-hand encounter-the Trojans from their chariots, and the Achaeans climbing up into\ntheir ships and wielding the long pikes that were lying on the decks ready for use in a sea-fight, jointed and shod\nwith bronze.\nNow Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fighting about the wall, but were not yet within it and\nat the ships, remained sitting in the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining him with his conversation and spreading\nherbs over his wound to ease his pain. When, however, he saw the Trojans swarming through the breach in the wall,\nwhile the Achaeans were clamouring and struck with panic, he cried aloud, and smote his two thighs with the flat\nof his hands. \u201cEurypylus,\u201d said he in his dismay, \u201cI know you want me badly, but I cannot stay with you any longer,\nfor there is hard fighting going on; a servant shall take care of you now, for I must make all speed to Achilles, and\ninduce him to fight if I can; who knows but with heaven\u2019s help I may persuade him. A man does well to listen to the\nadvice of a friend.\u201d\nWhen he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm and resisted the attack of the Trojans, yet\nthough these were fewer in number, they could not drive them back from the ships, neither could the Trojans break\nthe Achaean ranks and make their way in among the tents and ships. As a carpenter\u2019s line gives a true edge to a\npiece of ship\u2019s timber, in the hand of some skilled workman whom Minerva has instructed in all kinds of useful arts\n\u2014 even so level was the issue of the fight between the two sides, as they fought some round one and some round\nanother.\nHector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about the same ship. Hector could not force Ajax\nback and fire the ship, nor yet could Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which heaven had brought him.\nThen Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear as he was bringing fire towards the ship. He\nfell heavily to the ground and the torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his cousin fallen in front of the\nship he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying, \u201cTrojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, bate not a\njot, but rescue the son of Clytius lest the Achaeans strip him of his armour now that he has fallen.\u201d\nHe then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hit Lycophron a follower of Ajax, who came from\nCythera, but was living with Ajax inasmuch as he had killed a man among the Cythereans. Hector\u2019s spear struck\nhim on the head below the ear, and he fell headlong from the ship\u2019s prow on to the ground with no life left in him.\nAjax shook with rage and said to his brother, \u201cTeucer, my good fellow, our trusty comrade the son of Mastor has\nfallen, he came to live with us from Cythera and whom we honoured as much as our own parents. Hector has just\nkilled him; fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow which Phoebus Apollo gave you.\u201d\nTeucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver in his hands. Forthwith he showered his\narrows on the Trojans, and hit Cleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son of Panthous, with\nthe reins in his hands as he was attending to his horses; he was in the middle of the very thickest part of the fight,\ndoing good service to Hector and the Trojans, but evil had now come upon him, and not one of those who were\nfain to do so could avert it, for the arrow struck him on the back of the neck. He fell from his chariot and his horses\nshook the empty car as they swerved aside. King Polydamas saw what had happened, and was the first to come up\nto the horses; he gave them in charge to Astynous son of Protiaon, and ordered him to look on, and to keep the\nhorses near at hand. He then went back and took his place in the front ranks.\nTeucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have been no more fighting at the ships if he had\nhit him and killed him then and there: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector, had his eyes on Teucer, and de-\nprived him of his triumph, by breaking his bowstring for him just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim; on\n181 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthis the arrow went astray and the bow fell from his hands. Teucer shook with anger and said to his brother, \u201cAlas,\nsee how heaven thwarts us in all we do; it has broken my bowstring and snatched the bow from my hand, though I\nstrung it this selfsame morning that it might serve me for many an arrow.\u201d\nAjax son of Telamon answered, \u201cMy good fellow, let your bow and your arrows be, for Jove has made them use-\nless in order to spite the Danaans. Take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and both fight the Trojans\nyourself and urge others to do so. They may be successful for the moment but if we fight as we ought they will find\nit a hard matter to take the ships.\u201d\nTeucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders, and\non his comely head he set his helmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it; he\ngrasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and forthwith he was by the side of Ajax.\nWhen Hector saw that Teucer\u2019s bow was of no more use to him, he shouted out to the Trojans and Lycians,\n\u201cTrojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, be men, my friends, and show your mettle here at the ships,\nfor I see the weapon of one of their chieftains made useless by the hand of Jove. It is easy to see when Jove is helping\npeople and means to help them still further, or again when he is bringing them down and will do nothing for them;\nhe is now on our side, and is going against the Argives. Therefore swarm round the ships and fight. If any of you is\nstruck by spear or sword and loses his life, let him die; he dies with honour who dies fighting for his country; and\nhe will leave his wife and children safe behind him, with his house and allotment unplundered if only the Achaeans\ncan be driven back to their own land, they and their ships.\u201d\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on the other side exhorted his comrades saying,\n\u201cShame on you Argives, we are now utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving the enemy from our\nships. Do you think, if Hector takes them, that you will be able to get home by land? Can you not hear him cheering\non his whole host to fire our fleet, and bidding them remember that they are not at a dance but in battle? Our only\ncourse is to fight them with might and main; we had better chance it, life or death, once for all, than fight long and\nwithout issue hemmed in at our ships by worse men than ourselves.\u201d\nWith these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector then killed Schedius son of Perimedes, leader of the\nPhoceans, and Ajax killed Laodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor. Polydamas killed Otus of Cyllene\na comrade of the son of Phyleus and chief of the proud Epeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon him, but\nPolydamas crouched down, and he missed him, for Apollo would not suffer the son of Panthous to fall in battle; but\nthe spear hit Croesmus in the middle of his chest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and Meges stripped him of\nhis armour. At that moment the valiant soldier Dolops son of Lampus sprang upon Lampus was son of Laomedon\nand for his valour, while his son Dolops was versed in all the ways of war. He then struck the middle of the son of\nPhyleus\u2019 shield with his spear, setting on him at close quarters, but his good corslet made with plates of metal saved\nhim; Phyleus had brought it from Ephyra and the river Selleis, where his host, King Euphetes, had given it him to\nwear in battle and protect him. It now served to save the life of his son. Then Meges struck the topmost crest of\nDolops\u2019s bronze helmet with his spear and tore away its plume of horse-hair, so that all newly dyed with scarlet as it\nwas it tumbled down into the dust. While he was still fighting and confident of victory, Menelaus came up to help\nMeges, and got by the side of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder, from behind, and the point,\ndriven so furiously, went through into his chest, whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him to strip\nhim of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers for help, and he especially upbraided brave Melanippus\nson of Hiketaon, who erewhile used to pasture his herds of cattle in Percote before the war broke out; but when the\nships of the Danaans came, he went back to Ilius, where he was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near Priam\nwho treated him as one of his own sons. Hector now rebuked him and said, \u201cWhy, Melanippus, are we thus remiss?\ndo you take no note of the death of your kinsman, and do you not see how they are trying to take Dolops\u2019s armour?\nFollow me; there must be no fighting the Argives from a distance now, but we must do so in close combat till either\nwe kill them or they take the high wall of Ilius and slay her people.\u201d\nHe led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after. Meanwhile Ajax son of Telamon was cheering\non the Argives. \u201cMy friends,\u201d he cried, \u201cbe men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves in battle so as to win respect\nfrom one another. Men who respect each other\u2019s good opinion are less likely to be killed than those who do not, but\nin flight there is neither gain nor glory.\u201d\nThus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back the Trojans. They laid his words to heart and\nhedged the ships as with a wall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus of the loud battle-cry urged\nAntilochus on. \u201cAntilochus,\u201d said he, \u201cyou are young and there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or more\nvaliant than you are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan and kill him.\u201d\nHe hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at once darted out from the front ranks and\naimed a spear, after looking carefully round him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the dart did not speed from\nhis hand without effect, for it struck Melanippus the proud son of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was\ncoming forward, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Antilochus sprang upon\n182 The Iliad\nhim as a dog springs on a fawn which a hunter has hit as it was breaking away from its covert, and killed it. Even\nso, O Melanippus, did stalwart Antilochus spring upon you to strip you of your armour; but noble Hector marked\nhim, and came running up to him through the thick of the battle. Antilochus, brave soldier though he was, would\nnot stay to face him, but fled like some savage creature which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has killed\na dog or a man who is herding his cattle, before a body of men can be gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of\nNestor fly, and the Trojans and Hector with a cry that rent the air showered their weapons after him; nor did he\nturn round and stay his flight till he had reached his comrades.\nThe Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the ships in fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept\nspurring them on to new deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the Argives and defeated them by en-\ncouraging the Trojans. For he meant giving glory to Hector son of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon the ships,\ntill he had fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that Thetis had made him; Jove, therefore, bided his time till he should\nsee the glare of a blazing ship. From that hour he was about so to order that the Trojans should be driven back from\nthe ships and to vouchsafe glory to the Achaeans. With this purpose he inspired Hector son of Priam, who was\ncager enough already, to assail the ships. His fury was as that of Mars, or as when a fire is raging in the glades of\nsome dense forest upon the mountains; he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared under his terrible eye-brows, and\nhis helmet quivered on his temples by reason of the fury with which he fought. Jove from heaven was with him, and\nthough he was but one against many, vouchsafed him victory and glory; for he was doomed to an early death, and\nalready Pallas Minerva was hurrying on the hour of his destruction at the hands of the son of Peleus. Now, however,\nhe kept trying to break the ranks of the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in the goodliest armour;\nbut do what he might he could not break through them, for they stood as a tower foursquare, or as some high cliff\nrising from the grey sea that braves the anger of the gale, and of the waves that thunder up against it. He fell upon\nthem like flames of fire from every quarter. As when a wave, raised mountain high by wind and storm, breaks over\na ship and covers it deep in foam, the fierce winds roar against the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear,\nand they are saved but by a very little from destruction\u2014even so were the hearts of the Achaeans fainting within\nthem. Or as a savage lion attacking a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in the low-lying meadows\nby some wide-watered shore\u2014the herdsman is at his wit\u2019s end how to protect his herd and keeps going about now\nin the van and now in the rear of his cattle, while the lion springs into the thick of them and fastens on a cow so\nthat they all tremble for fear\u2014even so were the Achaeans utterly panic-stricken by Hector and father Jove. Never-\ntheless Hector only killed Periphetes of Mycenae; he was son of Copreus who was wont to take the orders of King\nEurystheus to mighty Hercules, but the son was a far better man than the father in every way; he was fleet of foot,\na valiant warrior, and in understanding ranked among the foremost men of Mycenae. He it was who then afforded\nHector a triumph, for as he was turning back he stumbled against the rim of his shield which reached his feet, and\nserved to keep the javelins off him. He tripped against this and fell face upward, his helmet ringing loudly about\nhis head as he did so. Hector saw him fall and ran up to him; he then thrust a spear into his chest, and killed him\nclose to his own comrades. These, for all their sorrow, could not help him for they were themselves terribly afraid of\nHector.\nThey had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had been drawn up first were on every side of\nthem, but the Trojans came pouring after them. The Argives were driven back from the first row of ships, but they\nmade a stand by their tents without being broken up and scattered; shame and fear restrained them. They kept\nshouting incessantly to one another, and Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, was loudest in im-\nploring every man by his parents, and beseeching him to stand firm.\n\u201cBe men, my friends,\u201d he cried, \u201cand respect one another\u2019s good opinion. Think, all of you, on your children,\nyour wives, your property, and your parents whether these be alive or dead. On their behalf though they are not\nhere, I implore you to stand firm, and not to turn in flight.\u201d\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva lifted the thick veil of darkness from their eyes,\nand much light fell upon them, alike on the side of the ships and on that where the fight was raging. They could see\nHector and all his men, both those in the rear who were taking no part in the battle, and those who were fighting by\nthe ships.\nAjax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but strode from deck to deck with a great sea-pike in\nhis hands twelve cubits long and jointed with rings. As a man skilled in feats of horsemanship couples four horses\ntogether and comes tearing full speed along the public way from the country into some large town\u2014many both\nmen and women marvel as they see him for he keeps all the time changing his horse, springing from one to another\nwithout ever missing his feet while the horses are at a gallop\u2014even so did Ajax go striding from one ship\u2019s deck to\nanother, and his voice went up into the heavens. He kept on shouting his orders to the Danaans and exhorting them\nto defend their ships and tents; neither did Hector remain within the main body of the Trojan warriors, but as a\ndun eagle swoops down upon a flock of wild-fowl feeding near a river-geese, it may be, or cranes, or long-necked\nswans\u2014even so did Hector make straight for a dark-prowed ship, rushing right towards it; for Jove with his mighty\n183 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nhand impelled him forward, and roused his people to follow him.\nAnd now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You would have thought the men were coming on fresh\nand unwearied, so fiercely did they fight; and this was the mind in which they were\u2014the Achaeans did not believe\nthey should escape destruction but thought themselves doomed, while there was not a Trojan but his heart beat\nhigh with the hope of firing the ships and putting the Achaean heroes to the sword.\nThus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern of the good ship that had brought Protesilaus to\nTroy, but never bore him back to his native land. Round this ship there raged a close hand-to-hand fight between\nDanaans and Trojans. They did not fight at a distance with bows and javelins, but with one mind hacked at one\nanother in close combat with their mighty swords and spears pointed at both ends; they fought moreover with keen\nbattle-axes and with hatchets. Many a good stout blade hilted and scabbarded with iron, fell from hand or shoulder\nas they fought, and the earth ran red with blood. Hector, when he had seized the ship, would not loose his hold but\nheld on to its curved stern and shouted to the Trojans, \u201cBring fire, and raise the battle-cry all of you with a single\nvoice. Now has Jove vouchsafed us a day that will pay us for all the rest; this day we shall take the ships which came\nhither against heaven\u2019s will, and which have caused us such infinite suffering through the cowardice of our coun-\ncillors, who when I would have done battle at the ships held me back and forbade the host to follow me; if Jove did\nthen indeed warp our judgements, himself now commands me and cheers me on.\u201d\nAs he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the Achaeans, and Ajax no longer held his ground,\nfor he was overcome by the darts that were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed. Therefore he left the\nraised deck at the stern, and stepped back on to the seven-foot bench of the oarsmen. Here he stood on the look-\nout, and with his spear held back Trojan whom he saw bringing fire to the ships. All the time he kept on shouting at\nthe top of his voice and exhorting the Danaans. \u201cMy friends,\u201d he cried, \u201cDanaan heroes, servants of Mars, be men\nmy friends, and fight with might and with main. Can we hope to find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us more\nsurely than the one we have? There is no strong city within reach, whence we may draw fresh forces to turn the\nscales in our favour. We are on the plain of the armed Trojans with the sea behind us, and far from our own coun-\ntry. Our salvation, therefore, is in the might of our hands and in hard fighting.\u201d\nAs he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and when any Trojan made towards the ships with fire\nat Hector\u2019s bidding, he would be on the look-out for him, and drive at him with his long spear. Twelve men did he\nthus kill in hand-to-hand fight before the ships.\nBook XVI\nTHUS did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclus drew near to Achilles with tears welling from\nhis eyes, as from some spring whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice. When Achilles saw him\nthus weeping he was sorry for him and said, \u201cWhy, Patroclus, do you stand there weeping like some silly child that\ncomes running to her mother, and begs to be taken up and carried\u2014she catches hold of her mother\u2019s dress to stay\nher though she is in a hurry, and looks tearfully up until her mother carries her\u2014even such tears, Patroclus, are you\nnow shedding. Have you anything to say to the Myrmidons or to myself? or have you had news from Phthia which\nyou alone know? They tell me Menoetius son of Actor is still alive, as also Peleus son of Aeacus, among the Myrmi-\ndons\u2014men whose loss we two should bitterly deplore; or are you grieving about the Argives and the way in which\nthey are being killed at the ships, throu their own high-handed doings? Do not hide anything from me but tell me\nthat both of us may know about it.\u201d\nThen, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered, \u201cAchilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the\nAchaeans, do not be angry, but I weep for the disaster that has now befallen the Argives. All those who have been\ntheir champions so far are lying at the ships, wounded by sword or spear. Brave Diomed son of Tydeus has been hit\nwith a spear, while famed Ulysses and Agamemnon have received sword-wounds; Eurypylus again has been struck\nwith an arrow in the thigh; skilled apothecaries are attending to these heroes, and healing them of their wounds; are\nyou still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May it never be my lot to nurse such a passion as you have done, to the baning\nof your own good name. Who in future story will speak well of you unless you now save the Argives from ruin? You\nknow no pity; knight Peleus was not your father nor Thetis your mother, but the grey sea bore you and the sheer\ncliffs begot you, so cruel and remorseless are you. If however you are kept back through knowledge of some oracle,\nor if your mother Thetis has told you something from the mouth of Jove, at least send me and the Myrmidons with\nme, if I may bring deliverance to the Danaans. Let me moreover wear your armour; the Trojans may thus mistake\nme for you and quit the field, so that the hard-pressed sons of the Achaeans may have breathing time\u2014which while\nthey are fighting may hardly be. We who are fresh might soon drive tired men back from our ships and tents to\ntheir own city.\u201d\nHe knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his own destruction. Achilles was deeply moved and\nanswered, \u201cWhat, noble Patroclus, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am heeding, nor has my mother\n184 The Iliad\ntold me anything from the mouth of Jove, but I am cut to the very heart that one of my own rank should dare to rob\nme because he is more powerful than I am. This, after all that I have gone through, is more than I can endure. The\ngirl whom the sons of the Achaeans chose for me, whom I won as the fruit of my spear on having sacked a city\u2014her\nhas King Agamemnon taken from me as though I were some common vagrant. Still, let bygones be bygones: no\nman may keep his anger for ever; I said I would not relent till battle and the cry of war had reached my own ships;\nnevertheless, now gird my armour about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle, for the dark cloud of\nTrojans has burst furiously over our fleet; the Argives are driven back on to the beach, cooped within a narrow\nspace, and the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out against them, because they see not the visor of my\nhelmet gleaming near them. Had they seen this, there would not have been a creek nor grip that had not been filled\nwith their dead as they fled back again. And so it would have been, if only King Agamemnon had dealt fairly by me.\nAs it is the Trojans have beset our host. Diomed son of Tydeus no longer wields his spear to defend the Danaans,\nneither have I heard the voice of the son of Atreus coming from his hated head, whereas that of murderous Hector\nrings in my cars as he gives orders to the Trojans, who triumph over the Achaeans and fill the whole plain with their\ncry of battle. But even so, Patroclus, fall upon them and save the fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and prevent us from\nbeing able to return. Do, however, as I now bid you, that you may win me great honour from all the Danaans, and\nthat they may restore the girl to me again and give me rich gifts into the bargain. When you have driven the Trojans\nfrom the ships, come back again. Though Juno\u2019s thundering husband should put triumph within your reach, do not\nfight the Trojans further in my absence, or you will rob me of glory that should be mine. And do not for lust of bat-\ntle go on killing the Trojans nor lead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest one of the ever-living gods from Olympus attack\nyou\u2014for Phoebus Apollo loves them well: return when you have freed the ships from peril, and let others wage war\nupon the plain. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that not a single man of all the Trojans might be left\nalive, nor yet of the Argives, but that we two might be alone left to tear aside the mantle that veils the brow of Troy.\u201d\nThus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground for the shower of darts that rained upon him;\nthe will of Jove and the javelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamed about his temples\nrang with the continuous clatter of the missiles that kept pouring on to it and on to the cheek-pieces that protected\nhis face. Moreover his left shoulder was tired with having held his shield so long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they\nwould, they could not make him give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the sweat rained from every pore of\nhis body, he had not a moment\u2019s respite, and on all sides he was beset by danger upon danger.\nAnd now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how fire was thrown upon the ships of the\nAchaeans. Hector came close up and let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax. He cut it clean in\ntwo just behind where the point was fastened on to the shaft of the spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a\nheadless spear, while the bronze point flew some way off and came ringing down on to the ground. Ajax knew the\nhand of heaven in this, and was dismayed at seeing that Jove had now left him utterly defenceless and was willing\nvictory for the Trojans. Therefore he drew back, and the Trojans flung fire upon the ship which was at once wrapped\nin flame.\nThe fire was now flaring about the ship\u2019s stern, whereon Achilles smote his two thighs and said to Patroclus,\n\u201cUp, noble knight, for I see the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they destroy our ships, and there be no way\nby which we may retreat. Gird on your armour at once while I call our people together.\u201d\nAs he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his legs with greaves of good make, and fitted with\nancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus, richly inlaid and studded. He hung\nhis silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his\nhelmet, well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it. He grasped two redoubtable\nspears that suited his hands, but he did not take the spear of noble Achilles, so stout and strong, for none other of\nthe Achaeans could wield it, though Achilles could do so easily. This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion, which\nChiron had cut upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus, wherewith to deal out death among heroes. He bade\nAutomedon yoke his horses with all speed, for he was the man whom he held in honour next after Achilles, and on\nwhose support in battle he could rely most firmly. Automedon therefore yoked the fleet horses Xanthus and Bali-\nus, steeds that could fly like the wind: these were they whom the harpy Podarge bore to the west wind, as she was\ngrazing in a meadow by the waters of the river Oceanus. In the side traces he set the noble horse Pedasus, whom\nAchilles had brought away with him when he sacked the city of Eetion, and who, mortal steed though he was, could\ntake his place along with those that were immortal.\nMeanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and bade his Myrmidons put on their armour.\nEven as fierce ravening wolves that are feasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon the mountains, and\ntheir jaws are red with blood\u2014they go in a pack to lap water from the clear spring with their long thin tongues; and\nthey reek of blood and slaughter; they know not what fear is, for it is hunger drives them\u2014even so did the leaders\nand counsellors of the Myrmidons gather round the good squire of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, and among them\nstood Achilles himself cheering on both men and horses.\n185 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nFifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each there was a crew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set\nfive captains whom he could trust, while he was himself commander over them all. Menesthius of the gleaming\ncorslet, son to the river Spercheius that streams from heaven, was captain of the first company. Fair Polydora daugh-\nter of Peleus bore him to ever-flowing Spercheius\u2014a woman mated with a god\u2014but he was called son of Borus son\nof Perieres, with whom his mother was living as his wedded wife, and who gave great wealth to gain her. The second\ncompany was led by noble Eudorus, son to an unwedded woman. Polymele, daughter of Phylas the graceful dancer,\nbore him; the mighty slayer of Argos was enamoured of her as he saw her among the singing women at a dance held\nin honour of Diana the rushing huntress of the golden arrows; he therefore\u2014 Mercury, giver of all good\u2014went with\nher into an upper chamber, and lay with her in secret, whereon she bore him a noble son Eudorus, singularly fleet\nof foot and in fight valiant. When Ilithuia goddess of the pains of child-birth brought him to the light of day, and he\nsaw the face of the sun, mighty Echecles son of Actor took the mother to wife, and gave great wealth to gain her, but\nher father Phylas brought the child up, and took care of him, doting as fondly upon him as though he were his own\nson. The third company was led by Pisander son of Maemalus, the finest spearman among all the Myrmidons next\nto Achilles\u2019 own comrade Patroclus. The old knight Phoenix was captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon,\nnoble son of Laerceus of the fifth.\nWhen Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all with their captains, he charged them straitly\nsaying, \u201cMyrmidons, remember your threats against the Trojans while you were at the ships in the time of my anger,\nand you were all complaining of me. \u2018Cruel son of Peleus,\u2019 you would say, \u2018your mother must have suckled you on\ngall, so ruthless are you. You keep us here at the ships against our will; if you are so relentless it were better we went\nhome over the sea.\u2019 Often have you gathered and thus chided with me. The hour is now come for those high feats of\narms that you have so long been pining for, therefore keep high hearts each one of you to do battle with the Tro-\njans.\u201d\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they serried their companies yet more closely when\nthey heard the of their king. As the stones which a builder sets in the wall of some high house which is to give\nshelter from the winds\u2014even so closely were the helmets and bossed shields set against one another. Shield pressed\non shield, helm on helm, and man on man; so close were they that the horse-hair plumes on the gleaming ridges of\ntheir helmets touched each other as they bent their heads.\nIn front of them all two men put on their armour\u2014Patroclus and Automedon\u2014two men, with but one mind to\nlead the Myrmidons. Then Achilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chest which silver-footed\nThetis had given him to take on board ship, and which she had filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, and\ngood thick rugs. In this chest he had a cup of rare workmanship, from which no man but himself might drink,\nnor would he make offering from it to any other god save only to father Jove. He took the cup from the chest and\ncleansed it with sulphur; this done he rinsed it clean water, and after he had washed his hands he drew wine. Then\nhe stood in the middle of the court and prayed, looking towards heaven, and making his drink-offering of wine;\nnor was he unseen of Jove whose joy is in thunder. \u201cKing Jove,\u201d he cried, \u201clord of Dodona, god of the Pelasgi, who\ndwellest afar, you who hold wintry Dodona in your sway, where your prophets the Selli dwell around you with their\nfeet unwashed and their couches made upon the ground\u2014if you heard me when I prayed to you aforetime, and did\nme honour while you sent disaster on the Achaeans, vouchsafe me now the fulfilment of yet this further prayer. I\nshall stay here where my ships are lying, but I shall send my comrade into battle at the head of many Myrmidons.\nGrant, O all-seeing Jove, that victory may go with him; put your courage into his heart that Hector may learn\nwhether my squire is man enough to fight alone, or whether his might is only then so indomitable when I myself\nenter the turmoil of war. Afterwards when he has chased the fight and the cry of battle from the ships, grant that he\nmay return unharmed, with his armour and his comrades, fighters in close combat.\u201d\nThus did he pray, and all-counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part of it he did indeed vouchsafe him\u2014but not\nthe whole. He granted that Patroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships, but refused to let him come\nsafely out of the fight.\nWhen he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilles went inside his tent and put back the cup\ninto his chest.\nThen he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fierce fight that raged between the Trojans and\nAchaeans.\nMeanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on till they sprang high in hope upon the Tro-\njans. They came swarming out like wasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children love to tease,\nwhereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung\u2014or again, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes\nthem by accident, every wasp will come flying out in a fury to defend his little ones\u2014even with such rage and cour-\nage did the Myrmidons swarm from their ships, and their cry of battle rose heavenwards. Patroclus called out to his\nmen at the top of his voice, \u201cMyrmidons, followers of Achilles son of Peleus, be men my friends, fight with might\nand with main, that we may win glory for the son of Peleus, who is far the foremost man at the ships of the Ar-\n186 The Iliad\ngives\u2014he, and his close fighting followers. The son of Atreus King Agamemnon will thus learn his folly in showing\nno respect to the bravest of the Achaeans.\u201d\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they fell in a body upon the Trojans. The ships rang\nagain with the cry which the Achaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave son of Menoetius and his squire\nall gleaming in their armour, they were daunted and their battalions were thrown into confusion, for they thought\nthe fleet son of Peleus must now have put aside his anger, and have been reconciled to Agamemnon; every one,\ntherefore, looked round about to see whither he might fly for safety.\nPatroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where men were packed most closely, by the stern of\nthe ship of Protesilaus. He hit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the Amydon and the broad\nwaters of the river Axius; the spear struck him on the right shoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust;\non this his men were thrown into confusion, for by killing their leader, who was the finest soldier among them, Pa-\ntroclus struck panic into them all. He thus drove them from the ship and quenched the fire that was then blazing\u2014\nleaving the half-burnt ship to lie where it was. The Trojans were now driven back with a shout that rent the skies,\nwhile the Danaans poured after them from their ships, shouting also without ceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of the\nthunder-cloud, spreads a dense canopy on the top of some lofty mountain, and all the peaks, the jutting headlands,\nand forest glades show out in the great light that flashes from the bursting heavens, even so when the Danaans had\nnow driven back the fire from their ships, they took breath for a little while; but the fury of the fight was not yet\nover, for the Trojans were not driven back in utter rout, but still gave battle, and were ousted from their ground only\nby sheer fighting.\nThe fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed one another when and how they could. The\nvaliant son of Menoetius first drove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he was turning round; the point\nwent clean through, and broke the bone so that he fell forward. Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the chest,\nwhere it was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. The son of Phyleus saw Amphiclus about to attack\nhim, and ere he could do so took aim at the upper part of his thigh, where the muscles are thicker than in any other\npart; the spear tore through all the sinews of the leg, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Of the sons of Nestor\none, Antilochus, speared Atymnius, driving the point of the spear through his throat, and down he fell. Maris then\nsprang on Antilochus in hand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode the body spear in hand; but valiant\nThrasymedes was too quick for him, and in a moment had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his blow;\nhis aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root of his arm, and tore them right down to the bone,\nso he fell heavily to the ground and his eyes were closed in darkness. Thus did these two noble comrades of Sarpe-\ndon go down to Erebus slain by the two sons of Nestor; they were the warrior sons of Amisodorus, who had reared\nthe invincible Chimaera, to the bane of many. Ajax son of Oileus sprang on Cleobulus and took him alive as he was\nentangled in the crush; but he killed him then and there by a sword-blow on the neck. The sword reeked with his\nblood, while dark death and the strong hand of fate gripped him and closed his eyes.\nPeneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed each other with their spears. They had both\nthrown without effect, so now they drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed crest of Peneleos\u2019 helmet but his\nsword broke at the hilt, while Peneleos smote Lycon on the neck under the ear. The blade sank so deep that the head\nwas held on by nothing but the skin, and there was no more life left in him. Meriones gave chase to Acamas on foot\nand caught him up just as he was about to mount his chariot; he drove a spear through his right shoulder so that\nhe fell headlong from the car, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Idomeneus speared Erymas in the mouth; the\nbronze point of the spear went clean through it beneath the brain, crashing in among the white bones and smashing\nthem up. His teeth were all of them knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream from both his eyes; it also\ncame gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils, and the darkness of death enfolded him round about.\nThus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill his man. As ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs,\nfastening on them when they are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flock through the careless-\nness of the shepherd\u2014and when the wolves see this they pounce upon them at once because they cannot defend\nthemselves\u2014even so did the Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled with ill-omened cries in their panic and had\nno more fight left in them.\nMeanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector, but Hector was so skilful that he held his\nbroad shoulders well under cover of his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the whizzing of the arrows and the\nheavy thud of the spears. He well knew that the fortunes of the day had changed, but still stood his ground and tried\nto protect his comrades.\nAs when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of a clear sky when Jove is brewing a gale\u2014even\nwith such panic stricken rout did the Trojans now fly, and there was no order in their going. Hector\u2019s fleet horses\nbore him and his armour out of the fight, and he left the Trojan host penned in by the deep trench against their\nwill. Many a yoke of horses snapped the pole of their chariots in the trench and left their master\u2019s car behind them.\nPatroclus gave chase, calling impetuously on the Danaans and full of fury against the Trojans, who, being now no\n187 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nlonger in a body, filled all the ways with their cries of panic and rout; the air was darkened with the clouds of dust\nthey raised, and the horses strained every nerve in their flight from the tents and ships towards the city.\nPatroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men flying in confusion, cheering on his men the\nwhile. Chariots were being smashed in all directions, and many a man came tumbling down from his own car to fall\nbeneath the wheels of that of Patroclus, whose immortal steeds, given by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trench\nat a bound as they sped onward. He was intent on trying to get near Hector, for he had set his heart on spearing\nhim, but Hector\u2019s horses were now hurrying him away. As the whole dark earth bows before some tempest on an\nautumn day when Jove rains his hardest to punish men for giving crooked judgement in their courts, and arriving\njustice therefrom without heed to the decrees of heaven\u2014all the rivers run full and the torrents tear many a new\nchannel as they roar headlong from the mountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works of men\u2014even such\nwas the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in their flight.\nPatroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and drove them back to the ships. They were doing\ntheir best to reach the city, but he would not Yet them, and bore down on them between the river and the ships and\nwall. Many a fallen comrade did he then avenge. First he hit Pronous with a spear on the chest where it was exposed\nnear the rim of his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground. Next he sprang on Thestor son of Enops, who was\nsitting all huddled up in his chariot, for he had lost his head and the reins had been torn out of his hands. Patroclus\nwent up to him and drove a spear into his right jaw; he thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear pulled him over\nthe rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of some jutting rock and draws a strong fish out of the sea with a hook\nand a line\u2014even so with his spear did he pull Thestor all gaping from his chariot; he then threw him down on his\nface and he died while falling. On this, as Erylaus was on to attack him, he struck him full on the head with a stone,\nand his brains were all battered inside his helmet, whereon he fell headlong to the ground and the pangs of death\ntook hold upon him. Then he laid low, one after the other, Erymas, Amphoterus, Epaltes, Tlepolemus, Echius son of\nDamastor, Pyris, lpheus, Euippus and Polymelus son of Argeas.\nNow when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled tunics, being overcome by Patroclus son of\nMenoetius, he rebuked the Lycians saying. \u201cShame on you, where are you flying to? Show your mettle; I will myself\nmeet this man in fight and learn who it is that is so masterful; he has done us much hurt, and has stretched many a\nbrave man upon the ground.\u201d\nHe sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he saw this, leaped on to the ground also. The two\nthen rushed at one another with loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned vultures that scream and tear at one\nanother in some high mountain fastness.\nThe son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said to Juno who was his wife and sister, \u201cAlas,\nthat it should be the lot of Sarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand of Patroclus. I am in two minds\nwhether to catch him up out of the fight and set him down safe and sound in the fertile land of Lycia, or to let him\nnow fall by the hand of the son of Menoetius.\u201d\nAnd Juno answered, \u201cMost dread son of Saturn, what is this that you are saying? Would you snatch a mortal\nman, whose doom has long been fated, out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we shall not all of us be of your\nmind. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, that if you send Sarpedon safely to his own home, some other\nof the gods will be also wanting to escort his son out of battle, for there are many sons of gods fighting round the\ncity of Troy, and you will make every one jealous. If, however, you are fond of him and pity him, let him indeed fall\nby the hand of Patroclus, but as soon as the life is gone out of him, send Death and sweet Sleep to bear him off the\nfield and take him to the broad lands of Lycia, where his brothers and his kinsmen will bury him with mound and\npillar, in due honour to the dead.\u201d\nThe sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood upon the earth in honour of his son whom Pa-\ntroclus was about to kill on the rich plain of Troy far from his home.\nWhen they were now come close to one another Patroclus struck Thrasydemus, the brave squire of Sarpedon,\nin the lower part of the belly, and killed him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroclus and missed him, but he\nstruck the horse Pedasus in the right shoulder, and it screamed aloud as it lay, groaning in the dust until the life\nwent out of it. The other two horses began to plunge; the pole of the chariot cracked and they got entangled in the\nreins through the fall of the horse that was yoked along with them; but Automedon knew what to do; without the\nloss of a moment he drew the keen blade that hung by his sturdy thigh and cut the third horse adrift; whereon the\nother two righted themselves, and pulling hard at the reins again went together into battle.\nSarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed him, the point of the spear passed over his left\nshoulder without hitting him. Patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not from his hand in vain, for he\nhit Sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds the ever-beating heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or tall\npine to which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains to make timber for ship-building\u2014even so did\nhe lie stretched at full length in front of his chariot and horses, moaning and clutching at the blood-stained dust.\nAs when a lion springs with a bound upon a herd of cattle and fastens on a great black bull which dies bellowing in\n188 The Iliad\nits clutches\u2014even so did the leader of the Lycian warriors struggle in death as he fell by the hand of Patroclus. He\ncalled on his trusty comrade and said, \u201cGlaucus, my brother, hero among heroes, put forth all your strength, fight\nwith might and main, now if ever quit yourself like a valiant soldier. First go about among the Lycian captains and\nbid them fight for Sarpedon; then yourself also do battle to save my armour from being taken. My name will haunt\nyou henceforth and for ever if the Achaeans rob me of my armour now that I have fallen at their ships. Do your\nvery utmost and call all my people together.\u201d\nDeath closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on his breast and drew the spear from his body,\nwhereon his senses came out along with it, and he drew out both spear-point and Sarpedon\u2019s soul at the same time.\nHard by the Myrmidons held his snorting steeds, who were wild with panic at finding themselves deserted by their\nlords.\nGlaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said, for he could not help him. He had to\nsupport his arm with his other hand, being in great pain through the wound which Teucer\u2019s arrow had given him\nwhen Teucer was defending the wall as he, Glaucus, was assailing it. Therefore he prayed to far-darting Apollo say-\ning, \u201cHear me O king from your seat, may be in the rich land of Lycia, or may be in Troy, for in all places you can\nhear the prayer of one who is in distress, as I now am. I have a grievous wound; my hand is aching with pain, there\nis no staunching the blood, and my whole arm drags by reason of my hurt, so that I cannot grasp my sword nor go\namong my foes and fight them, thou our prince, Jove\u2019s son Sarpedon, is slain. Jove defended not his son, do you,\ntherefore, O king, heal me of my wound, ease my pain and grant me strength both to cheer on the Lycians and to\nfight along with them round the body of him who has fallen.\u201d\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain, staunched the black blood from the wound,\nand gave him new strength. Glaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god had answered his prayer;\nforthwith, therefore, he went among the Lycian captains, and bade them come to fight about the body of Sarpedon.\nFrom these he strode on among the Trojans to Polydamas son of Panthous and Agenor; he then went in search of\nAeneas and Hector, and when he had found them he said, \u201cHector, you have utterly forgotten your allies, who lan-\nguish here for your sake far from friends and home while you do nothing to support them. Sarpedon leader of the\nLycian warriors has fallen\u2014he who was at once the right and might of Lycia; Mars has laid him low by the spear of\nPatroclus. Stand by him, my friends, and suffer not the Myrmidons to strip him of his armour, nor to treat his body\nwith contumely in revenge for all the Danaans whom we have speared at the ships.\u201d\nAs he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable grief; for Sarpedon, alien though he was,\nhad been one of the main stays of their city, both as having much people with him, and himself the foremost among\nthem all. Led by Hector, who was infuriated by the fall of Sarpedon, they made instantly for the Danaans with all\ntheir might, while the undaunted spirit of Patroclus son of Menoetius cheered on the Achaeans. First he spoke to\nthe two Ajaxes, men who needed no bidding. \u201cAjaxes,\u201d said he, \u201cmay it now please you to show youselves the men\nyou have always been, or even better\u2014Sarpedon is fallen \u2014 he who was first to overleap the wall of the Achaeans;\nlet us take the body and outrage it; let us strip the armour from his shoulders, and kill his comrades if they try to\nrescue his body.\u201d\nHe spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides, therefore, the Trojans and Lycians on the one\nhand, and the Myrmidons and Achaeans on the other, strengthened their battalions, and fought desperately about\nthe body of Sarpedon, shouting fiercely the while. Mighty was the din of their armour as they came together, and\nJove shed a thick darkness over the fight, to increase the of the battle over the body of his son.\nAt first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for one of the best men among the Myrmidons\nwas killed, Epeigeus, son of noble Agacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of Budeum; but presently,\nhaving killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he took refuge with Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius the land\nof noble steeds to fight the Trojans under Achilles. Hector now struck him on the head with a stone just as he had\ncaught hold of the body, and his brains inside his helmet were all battered in, so that he fell face foremost upon the\nbody of Sarpedon, and there died. Patroclus was enraged by the death of his comrade, and sped through the front\nranks as swiftly as a hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings. Even so swiftly, O noble knight Patro-\nclus, did you make straight for the Lycians and Trojans to avenge your comrade. Forthwith he struck Sthenelaus\nthe son of Ithaemenes on the neck with a stone, and broke the tendons that join it to the head and spine. On this\nHector and the front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a man can throw a javelin when competing for some\nprize, or even in battle\u2014so far did the Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans. Glaucus, captain of the Lycians, was\nthe first to rally them, by killing Bathycles son of Chalcon who lived in Hellas and was the richest man among the\nMyrmidons. Glaucus turned round suddenly, just as Bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of him,\nand drove his spear right into the middle of his chest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and the fall of so good\na man filled the Achaeans with dismay, while the Trojans were exultant, and came up in a body round the corpse.\nNevertheless the Achaeans, mindful of their prowess, bore straight down upon them.\nMeriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus son of Onetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt.\n189 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nIda, and was honoured by the people as though he were a god. Meriones struck him under the jaw and ear, so that\nlife went out of him and the darkness of death laid hold upon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear at Meriones, hop-\ning to hit him under the shield as he was advancing, but Meriones saw it coming and stooped forward to avoid it,\nwhereon the spear flew past him and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on quivering till Mars\nrobbed it of its force. The spear, therefore, sped from Aeneas\u2019s hand in vain and fell quivering to the ground. Aeneas\nwas angry and said, \u201cMeriones, you are a good dancer, but if I had hit you my spear would soon have made an end\nof you.\u201d\nAnd Meriones answered, \u201cAeneas, for all your bravery, you will not be able to make an end of every one who\ncomes against you. You are only a mortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in the middle of your shield with my\nspear, however strong and self-confident you may be, I should soon vanquish you, and you would yield your life to\nHades of the noble steeds.\u201d\nOn this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, \u201cMeriones, hero though you be, you should not speak thus;\ntaunting speeches, my good friend, will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead body; some of them must\ngo under ground first; blows for battle, and words for council; fight, therefore, and say nothing.\u201d\nHe led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. As the sound of woodcutters in some forest\nglade upon the mountains\u2014and the thud of their axes is heard afar \u2014 even such a din now rose from earth-clash of\nbronze armour and of good ox-hide shields, as men smote each other with their swords and spears pointed at both\nends. A man had need of good eyesight now to know Sarpedon, so covered was he from head to foot with spears\nand blood and dust. Men swarmed about the body, as flies that buzz round the full milk-pails in spring when they\nare brimming with milk\u2014even so did they gather round Sarpedon; nor did Jove turn his keen eyes away for one\nmoment from the fight, but kept looking at it all the time, for he was settling how best to kill Patroclus, and consid-\nering whether Hector should be allowed to end him now in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, and strip him of\nhis armour, or whether he should let him give yet further trouble to the Trojans. In the end, he deemed it best that\nthe brave squire of Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and the Trojans back towards the city and take the\nlives of many. First, therefore, he made Hector turn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot and fled, bidding\nthe other Trojans fly also, for he saw that the scales of Jove had turned against him. Neither would the brave Lycians\nstand firm; they were dismayed when they saw their king lying struck to the heart amid a heap of corpses\u2014for\nwhen the son of Saturn made the fight wax hot many had fallen above him. The Achaeans, therefore stripped the\ngleaming armour from his shoulders and the brave son of Menoetius gave it to his men to take to the ships. Then\nJove lord of the storm-cloud said to Apollo, \u201cDear Phoebus, go, I pray you, and take Sarpedon out of range of the\nweapons; cleanse the black blood from off him, and then bear him a long way off where you may wash him in the\nriver, anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in immortal raiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the two\nfleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who will carry him straightway to the rich land of Lycia, where his brothers and\nkinsmen will inter him, and will raise both mound and pillar to his memory, in due honour to the dead.\u201d\nThus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father\u2019s saying, and came down from the heights of Ida into the thick of the\nfight; forthwith he took Sarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a long way off, where he washed\nhim in the river, anointed him with ambrosia and clothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed him\nto the arms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who presently set him down in the rich land of Lycia.\nMeanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to Automedon, pursued the Trojans and Lycians in\nthe pride and foolishness of his heart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the son of Peleus, he would have, escaped\ndeath and have been scatheless; but the counsels of Jove pass man\u2019s understanding; he will put even a brave man to\nflight and snatch victory from his grasp, or again he will set him on to fight, as he now did when he put a high spirit\ninto the heart of Patroclus.\nWho then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, when the gods had now called you to meet your\ndoom? First Adrestus, Autonous, Echeclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor and Melanippus; after these he killed\nElasus, Mulius, and Pylartes. These he slew, but the rest saved themselves by flight.\nThe sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands of Patroclus, for his spear flew in all direc-\ntions, had not Phoebus Apollo taken his stand upon the wall to defeat his purpose and to aid the Trojans. Thrice did\nPatroclus charge at an angle of the high wall, and thrice did Apollo beat him back, striking his shield with his own\nimmortal hands. When Patroclus was coming on like a god for yet a fourth time, Apollo shouted to him with an\nawful voice and said, \u201cDraw back, noble Patroclus, it is not your lot to sack the city of the Trojan chieftains, nor yet\nwill it be that of Achilles who is a far better man than you are.\u201d On hearing this, Patroclus withdrew to some dis-\ntance and avoided the anger of Apollo.\nMeanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaean gates, in doubt whether to drive out again and\ngo on fighting, or to call the army inside the gates. As he was thus doubting Phoebus Apollo drew near him in the\nlikeness of a young and lusty warrior Asius, who was Hector\u2019s uncle, being own brother to Hecuba, and son of Dy-\nmas who lived in Phrygia by the waters of the river Sangarius; in his likeness Jove\u2019s son Apollo now spoke to Hector\n190 The Iliad\nsaying, \u201cHector, why have you left off fighting? It is ill done of you. If I were as much better a man than you, as I am\nworse, you should soon rue your slackness. Drive straight towards Patroclus, if so be that Apollo may grant you a\ntriumph over him, and you may rull him.\u201d\nWith this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and Hector bade Cebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo\npassed in among them, and struck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to Hector and the Trojans. Hec-\ntor let the other Danaans alone and killed no man, but drove straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then sprang from his\nchariot to the ground, with a spear in his left hand, and in his right a jagged stone as large as his hand could hold.\nHe stood still and threw it, nor did it go far without hitting some one; the cast was not in vain, for the stone struck\nCebriones, Hector\u2019s charioteer, a bastard son of Priam, as he held the reins in his hands. The stone hit him on the\nforehead and drove his brows into his head for the bone was smashed, and his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He\ndropped dead from his chariot as though he were diving, and there was no more life left in him. Over him did you\nthen vaunt, O knight Patroclus, saying, \u201cBless my heart, how active he is, and how well he dives. If we had been at\nsea this fellow would have dived from the ship\u2019s side and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew could stom-\nach, even in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off his chariot on to the ground. It seems, then, that there are\ndivers also among the Trojans.\u201d\nAs he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as it were, of a lion that while attacking a stockyard\nis himself struck in the chest, and his courage is his own bane\u2014even so furiously, O Patroclus, did you then spring\nupon Cebriones. Hector sprang also from his chariot to the ground. The pair then fought over the body of Cebri-\nones. As two lions fight fiercely on some high mountain over the body of a stag that they have killed, even so did\nthese two mighty warriors, Patroclus son of Menoetius and brave Hector, hack and hew at one another over the\ncorpse of Cebriones. Hector would not let him go when he had once got him by the head, while Patroclus kept fast\nhold of his feet, and a fierce fight raged between the other Danaans and Trojans. As the east and south wind buf-\nfet one another when they beat upon some dense forest on the mountains\u2014there is beech and ash and spreading\ncornel; the to of the trees roar as they beat on one another, and one can hear the boughs cracking and breaking\u2014\neven so did the Trojans and Achaeans spring upon one another and lay about each other, and neither side would\ngive way. Many a pointed spear fell to ground and many a winged arrow sped from its bow-string about the body of\nCebriones; many a great stone, moreover, beat on many a shield as they fought around his body, but there he lay in\nthe whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless of his driving now.\nSo long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of either side were alike deadly, and the people\nfell; but when he went down towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Achaeans proved to be beyond all\nforecast stronger, so that they drew Cebriones out of range of the darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped the\narmour from his shoulders. Then Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierce intent and a terrific shout upon the Trojans,\nand thrice did he kill nine men; but as he was coming on like a god for a time, then, O Patroclus, was the hour of\nyour end approaching, for Phoebus fought you in fell earnest. Patroclus did not see him as he moved about in the\ncrush, for he was enshrouded in thick darkness, and the god struck him from behind on his back and his broad\nshoulders with the flat of his hand, so that his eyes turned dizzy. Phoebus Apollo beat the helmet from off his head,\nand it rolled rattling off under the horses\u2019 feet, where its horse-hair plumes were all begrimed with dust and blood.\nNever indeed had that helmet fared so before, for it had served to protect the head and comely forehead of the god-\nlike hero Achilles. Now, however, Zeus delivered it over to be worn by Hector. Nevertheless the end of Hector also\nwas near. The bronze-shod spear, so great and so strong, was broken in the hand of Patroclus, while his shield that\ncovered him from head to foot fell to the ground as did also the band that held it, and Apollo undid the fastenings\nof his corslet.\nOn this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he stood as one dazed; whereon Euphorbus son\nof Panthous a Dardanian, the best spearman of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetest runner, came\nbehind him and struck him in the back with a spear, midway between the shoulders. This man as soon as ever he\nhad come up with his chariot had dismounted twenty men, so proficient was he in all the arts of war\u2014he it was, O\nknight Patroclus, that first drove a weapon into you, but he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbus then ran back\ninto the crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the wound; he would not stand firm and wait for Patroclus,\nunarmed though he now was, to attack him; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by the blow the god had given him and\nby the spear-wound, drew back under cover of his men in fear for his life. Hector on this, seeing him to be wound-\ned and giving ground, forced his way through the ranks, and when close up with him struck him in the lower part\nof the belly with a spear, driving the bronze point right through it, so that he fell heavily to the ground to the great\nof the Achaeans. As when a lion has fought some fierce wild-boar and worsted him\u2014the two fight furiously upon\nthe mountains over some little fountain at which they would both drink, and the lion has beaten the boar till he\ncan hardly breathe\u2014even so did Hector son of Priam take the life of the brave son of Menoetius who had killed so\nmany, striking him from close at hand, and vaunting over him the while. \u201cPatroclus,\u201d said he, \u201cyou deemed that you\nshould sack our city, rob our Trojan women of their freedom, and carry them off in your ships to your own country.\n191 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nFool; Hector and his fleet horses were ever straining their utmost to defend them. I am foremost of all the Trojan\nwarriors to stave the day of bondage from off them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here. Poor wretch, Achilles\nwith all his bravery availed you nothing; and yet I ween when you left him he charged you straitly saying, \u2018Come not\nback to the ships, knight Patroclus, till you have rent the bloodstained shirt of murderous Hector about his body.\nThus I ween did he charge you, and your fool\u2019s heart answered him \u2018yea\u2019 within you.\u201d\nThen, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knight Patroclus: \u201cHector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son\nof Saturn and Apollo have vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquished me so easily, and they who have\nstripped the armour from my shoulders; had twenty such men as you attacked me, all of them would have fallen\nbefore my spear. Fate and the son of Leto have overpowered me, and among mortal men Euphorbus; you are your-\nself third only in the killing of me. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, you too shall live but for a little\nseason; death and the day of your doom are close upon you, and they will lay you low by the hand of Achilles son of\nAeacus.\u201d\nWhen he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul left his body and flitted down to the house\nof Hades, mourning its sad fate and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Dead though he was,\nHector still spoke to him saying, \u201cPatroclus, why should you thus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son\nof lovely Thetis, may be smitten by my spear and die before me?\u201d\nAs he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his foot upon the body, which he thrust off\nand let lie on its back. He then went spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, for\nhe longed to lay him low, but the immortal steeds which the gods had given as a rich gift to Peleus bore him swiftly\nfrom the field.\nBook XVII\nBRAVE Menelaus son of Atreus now came to know that Patroclus had fallen, and made his way through the\nfront ranks clad in full armour to bestride him. As a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even so did yellow-haired\nMenelaus bestride Patroclus. He held his round shield and his spear in front of him, resolute to kill any who should\ndare face him. But the son of Panthous had also noted the body, and came up to Menelaus saying, \u201cMenelaus, son of\nAtreus, draw back, leave the body, and let the bloodstained spoils be. I was first of the Trojans and their brave allies\nto drive my spear into Patroclus, let me, therefore, have my full glory among the Trojans, or I will take aim and kill\nyou.\u201d\nTo this Menelaus answered in great anger \u201cBy father Jove, boasting is an ill thing. The pard is not more bold,\nnor the lion nor savage wild-boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all creatures, than are the proud sons of\nPanthous. Yet Hyperenor did not see out the days of his youth when he made light of me and withstood me, deem-\ning me the meanest soldier among the Danaans. His own feet never bore him back to gladden his wife and parents.\nEven so shall I make an end of you too, if you withstand me; get you back into the crowd and do not face me, or it\nshall be worse for you. Even a fool may be wise after the event.\u201d\nEuphorbus would not listen, and said, \u201cNow indeed, Menelaus, shall you pay for the death of my brother over\nwhom you vaunted, and whose wife you widowed in her bridal chamber, while you brought grief unspeakable on\nhis parents. I shall comfort these poor people if I bring your head and armour and place them in the hands of Pan-\nthous and noble Phrontis. The time is come when this matter shall be fought out and settled, for me or against me.\u201d\nAs he spoke he struck Menelaus full on the shield, but the spear did not go through, for the shield turned its\npoint. Menelaus then took aim, praying to father Jove as he did so; Euphorbus was drawing back, and Menelaus\nstruck him about the roots of his throat, leaning his whole weight on the spear, so as to drive it home. The point\nwent clean through his neck, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. His hair\nwhich was like that of the Graces, and his locks so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold, were all bedrabbled\nwith blood. As one who has grown a fine young olive tree in a clear space where there is abundance of water\u2014the\nplant is full of promise, and though the winds beat upon it from every quarter it puts forth its white blossoms till\nthe blasts of some fierce hurricane sweep down upon it and level it with the ground\u2014even so did Menelaus strip the\nfair youth Euphorbus of his armour after he had slain him. Or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in the pride\nof his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it is feeding\u2014first he breaks her neck with his strong jaws,\nand then gorges on her blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue and cry against him, but they stand aloof\nand will not come close to him, for they are pale with fear\u2014even so no one had the courage to face valiant Mene-\nlaus. The son of Atreus would have then carried off the armour of the son of Panthous with ease, had not Phoebus\nApollo been angry, and in the guise of Mentes chief of the Cicons incited Hector to attack him. \u201cHector,\u201d said he,\n\u201cyou are now going after the horses of the noble son of Aeacus, but you will not take them; they cannot be kept in\nhand and driven by mortal man, save only by Achilles, who is son to an immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaus son\nof Atreus has bestridden the body of Patroclus and killed the noblest of the Trojans, Euphorbus son of Panthous, so\n192 The Iliad\nthat he can fight no more.\u201d\nThe god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul of Hector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he\nlooked along the ranks and saw Euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still flowing from his wound, and\nMenelaus stripping him of his armour. On this he made his way to the front like a flame of fire, clad in his gleaming\narmour, and crying with a loud voice. When the son of Atreus heard him, he said to himself in his dismay, \u201cAlas!\nwhat shall I do? I may not let the Trojans take the armour of Patroclus who has fallen fighting on my behalf, lest\nsome Danaan who sees me should cry shame upon me. Still if for my honour\u2019s sake I fight Hector and the Trojans\nsingle-handed, they will prove too many for me, for Hector is bringing them up in force. Why, however, should I\nthus hesitate? When a man fights in despite of heaven with one whom a god befriends, he will soon rue it. Let no\nDanaan think ill of me if I give place to Hector, for the hand of heaven is with him. Yet, if I could find Ajax, the two\nof us would fight Hector and heaven too, if we might only save the body of Patroclus for Achilles son of Peleus. This,\nof many evils would be the least.\u201d\nWhile he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him with Hector at their head; he therefore drew back\nand left the body, turning about like some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs and men from a stockyard with\nspears and hue and cry, whereon he is daunted and slinks sulkily off\u2014even so did Menelaus son of Atreus turn and\nleave the body of Patroclus. When among the body of his men, he looked around for mighty Ajax son of Telamon,\nand presently saw him on the extreme left of the fight, cheering on his men and exhorting them to keep on fighting,\nfor Phoebus Apollo had spread a great panic among them. He ran up to him and said, \u201cAjax, my good friend, come\nwith me at once to dead Patroclus, if so be that we may take the body to Achilles\u2014as for his armour, Hector already\nhas it.\u201d\nThese words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among the front ranks, Menelaus going with him.\nHector had stripped Patroclus of his armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his head and take the body to\nfling before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax came up with his shield like wall before him, on which Hector withdrew\nunder shelter of his men, and sprang on to his chariot, giving the armour over to the Trojans to take to the city, as a\ngreat trophy for himself; Ajax, therefore, covered the body of Patroclus with his broad shield and bestrode him; as\na lion stands over his whelps if hunters have come upon him in a forest when he is with his little ones\u2014in the pride\nand fierceness of his strength he draws his knit brows down till they cover his eyes\u2014even so did Ajax bestride the\nbody of Patroclus, and by his side stood Menelaus son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow in his heart.\nThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus looked fiercely at Hector and rebuked him sternly. \u201cHector,\u201d said he, \u201cyou\nmake a brave show, but in fight you are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has no claim to so great a reputation.\nThink how you may now save your town and citadel by the hands of your own people born in Ilius; for you will get\nno Lycians to fight for you, seeing what thanks they have had for their incessant hardships. Are you likely, sir, to do\nanything to help a man of less note, after leaving Sarpedon, who was at once your guest and comrade in arms, to be\nthe spoil and prey of the Danaans? So long as he lived he did good service both to your city and yourself; yet you\nhad no stomach to save his body from the dogs. If the Lycians will listen to me, they will go home and leave Troy to\nits fate. If the Trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which lays hold of men who are fighting for their coun-\ntry and harassing those who would attack it, we should soon bear off Patroclus into Ilius. Could we get this dead\nman away and bring him into the city of Priam, the Argives would readily give up the armour of Sarpedon, and we\nshould get his body to boot. For he whose squire has been now killed is the foremost man at the ships of the Achae-\nans\u2014he and his close-fighting followers. Nevertheless you dared not make a stand against Ajax, nor face him, eye to\neye, with battle all round you, for he is a braver man than you are.\u201d\nHector scowled at him and answered, \u201cGlaucus, you should know better. I have held you so far as a man of\nmore understanding than any in all Lycia, but now I despise you for saying that I am afraid of Ajax. I fear neither\nbattle nor the din of chariots, but Jove\u2019s will is stronger than ours; Jove at one time makes even a strong man draw\nback and snatches victory from his grasp, while at another he will set him on to fight. Come hither then, my friend,\nstand by me and see indeed whether I shall play the coward the whole day through as you say, or whether I shall not\nstay some even of the boldest Danaans from fighting round the body of Patroclus.\u201d\nAs he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, \u201cTrojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in close combat,\nbe men, my friends, and fight might and main, while I put on the goodly armour of Achilles, which I took when I\nkilled Patroclus.\u201d\nWith this Hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his men who were taking the armour of Achilles to Troy,\nbut had not yet got far. Standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he changed his armour. His own he sent to\nthe strong city of Ilius and to the Trojans, while he put on the immortal armour of the son of Peleus, which the gods\nhad given to Peleus, who in his age gave it to his son; but the son did not grow old in his father\u2019s armour.\nWhen Jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw Hector standing aloof and arming himself in the armour of the son\nof Peleus, he wagged his head and muttered to himself saying, \u201cA! poor wretch, you arm in the armour of a hero,\nbefore whom many another trembles, and you reck nothing of the doom that is already close upon you. You have\n193 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nkilled his comrade so brave and strong, but it was not well that you should strip the armour from his head and\nshoulders. I do indeed endow you with great might now, but as against this you shall not return from battle to lay\nthe armour of the son of Peleus before Andromache.\u201d\nThe son of Saturn bowed his portentous brows, and Hector fitted the armour to his body, while terrible Mars\nentered into him, and filled his whole body with might and valour. With a shout he strode in among the allies, and\nhis armour flashed about him so that he seemed to all of them like the great son of Peleus himself. He went about\namong them and cheered them on\u2014Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, Thersilochus, Asteropaeus, Deisenor and Hippot-\nhous, Phorcys, Chromius and Ennomus the augur. All these did he exhort saying, \u201cHear me, allies from other cities\nwho are here in your thousands, it was not in order to have a crowd about me that I called you hither each from his\nseveral city, but that with heart and soul you might defend the wives and little ones of the Trojans from the fierce\nAchaeans. For this do I oppress my people with your food and the presents that make you rich. Therefore turn, and\ncharge at the foe, to stand or fall as is the game of war; whoever shall bring Patroclus, dead though he be, into the\nhands of the Trojans, and shall make Ajax give way before him, I will give him one half of the spoils while I keep the\nother. He will thus share like honour with myself.\u201d\nWhen he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaans with their spears held out before them,\nand the hopes of each ran high that he should force Ajax son of Telamon to yield up the body\u2014fools that they were,\nfor he was about to take the lives of many. Then Ajax said to Menelaus, \u201cMy good friend Menelaus, you and I shall\nhardly come out of this fight alive. I am less concerned for the body of Patroclus, who will shortly become meat\nfor the dogs and vultures of Troy, than for the safety of my own head and yours. Hector has wrapped us round in a\nstorm of battle from every quarter, and our destruction seems now certain. Call then upon the princes of the Da-\nnaans if there is any who can hear us.\u201d\nMenelaus did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help at the top of his voice. \u201cMy friends,\u201d he cried,\n\u201cprinces and counsellors of the Argives, all you who with Agamemnon and Menelaus drink at the public cost, and\ngive orders each to his own people as Jove vouchsafes him power and glory, the fight is so thick about me that I can-\nnot distinguish you severally; come on, therefore, every man unbidden, and think it shame that Patroclus should\nbecome meat and morsel for Trojan hounds.\u201d\nFleet Ajax son of Oileus heard him and was first to force his way through the fight and run to help him. Next\ncame Idomeneus and Meriones his esquire, peer of murderous Mars. As for the others that came into the fight after\nthese, who of his own self could name them?\nThe Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As a great wave that comes thundering in at the mouth\nof some heaven-born river, and the rocks that jut into the sea ring with the roar of the breakers that beat and buffet\nthem\u2014even with such a roar did the Trojans come on; but the Achaeans in singleness of heart stood firm about\nthe son of Menoetius, and fenced him with their bronze shields. Jove, moreover, hid the brightness of their helmets\nin a thick cloud, for he had borne no grudge against the son of Menoetius while he was still alive and squire to the\ndescendant of Aeacus; therefore he was loth to let him fall a prey to the dogs of his foes the Trojans, and urged his\ncomrades on to defend him.\nAt first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back, and they withdrew from the dead man daunted. The Trojans\ndid not succeed in killing any one, nevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did not lose it long,\nfor Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus alike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied them and\nmade towards the front like a wild boar upon the mountains when he stands at bay in the forest glades and routs\nthe hounds and lusty youths that have attacked him\u2014even so did Ajax son of Telamon passing easily in among the\nphalanxes of the Trojans, disperse those who had bestridden Patroclus and were most bent on winning glory by\ndragging him off to their city. At this moment Hippothous brave son of the Pelasgian Lethus, in his zeal for Hector\nand the Trojans, was dragging the body off by the foot through the press of the fight, having bound a strap round\nthe sinews near the ancle; but a mischief soon befell him from which none of those could save him who would have\ngladly done so, for the son of Telamon sprang forward and smote him on his bronze-cheeked helmet. The plumed\nheadpiece broke about the point of the weapon, struck at once by the spear and by the strong hand of Ajax, so that\nthe bloody brain came oozing out through the crest-socket. His strength then failed him and he let Patroclus\u2019 foot\ndrop from his hand, as he fell full length dead upon the body; thus he died far from the fertile land of Larissa, and\nnever repaid his parents the cost of bringing him up, for his life was cut short early by the spear of mighty Ajax.\nHector then took aim at Ajax with a spear, but he saw it coming and just managed to avoid it; the spear passed on\nand struck Schedius son of noble Iphitus, captain of the Phoceans, who dwelt in famed Panopeus and reigned over\nmuch people; it struck him under the middle of the collar-bone the bronze point went right through him, coming\nout at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\nAjax in his turn struck noble Phorcys son of Phaenops in the middle of the belly as he was bestriding Hippothous,\nand broke the plate of his cuirass; whereon the spear tore out his entrails and he clutched the ground in his palm as\nhe fell to earth. Hector and those who were in the front rank then gave ground, while the Argives raised a loud cry\n194 The Iliad\nof triumph, and drew off the bodies of Phorcys and Hippothous which they stripped presently of their armour.\nThe Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans and driven back to Ilius through their own\ncowardice, while the Argives, so great was their courage and endurance, would have achieved a triumph even\nagainst the will of Jove, if Apollo had not roused Aeneas, in the likeness of Periphas son of Epytus, an attendant\nwho had grown old in the service of Aeneas\u2019 aged father, and was at all times devoted to him. In his likeness, then,\nApollo said, \u201cAeneas, can you not manage, even though heaven be against us, to save high Ilius? I have known men,\nwhose numbers, courage, and self-reliance have saved their people in spite of Jove, whereas in this case he would\nmuch rather give victory to us than to the Danaans, if you would only fight instead of being so terribly afraid.\u201d\nAeneas knew Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted to Hector saying, \u201cHector and all other Tro-\njans and allies, shame on us if we are beaten by the Achaeans and driven back to Ilius through our own cowardice.\nA god has just come up to me and told me that Jove the supreme disposer will be with us. Therefore let us make for\nthe Danaans, that it may go hard with them ere they bear away dead Patroclus to the ships.\u201d\nAs he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then rallied and again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas\nspeared Leiocritus son of Arisbas, a valiant follower of Lycomedes, and Lycomedes was moved with pity as he saw\nhim fall; he therefore went close up, and speared Apisaon son of Hippasus shepherd of his people in the liver under\nthe midriff, so that he died; he had come from fertile Paeonia and was the best man of them all after Asteropaeus.\nAsteropaeus flew forward to avenge him and attack the Danaans, but this might no longer be, inasmuch as those\nabout Patroclus were well covered by their shields, and held their spears in front of them, for Ajax had given them\nstrict orders that no man was either to give ground, or to stand out before the others, but all were to hold well\ntogether about the body and fight hand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax bid them, and the earth ran red with blood as\nthe corpses fell thick on one another alike on the side of the Trojans and allies, and on that of the Danaans; for these\nlast, too, fought no bloodless fight though many fewer of them perished, through the care they took to defend and\nstand by one another.\nThus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as though it had gone hard even with the sun and moon,\nfor they were hidden over all that part where the bravest heroes were fighting about the dead son of Menoetius,\nwhereas the other Danaans and Achaeans fought at their ease in full daylight with brilliant sunshine all round them,\nand there was not a cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain. These last moreover would rest for a while and\nleave off fighting, for they were some distance apart and beyond the range of one another\u2019s weapons, whereas those\nwho were in the thick of the fray suffered both from battle and darkness. All the best of them were being worn out\nby the great weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes, Thrasymedes and Antilochus, had not yet heard of\nthe death of Patroclus, and believed him to be still alive and leading the van against the Trojans; they were keeping\nthemselves in reserve against the death or rout of their own comrades, for so Nestor had ordered when he sent\nthem from the ships into battle.\nThus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the sweat of their toil rained ever on their legs\nunder them, and on their hands and eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet son of Peleus. It was as when a\nman gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fat to his men, and bids them stretch it; whereon they stand round it in\na ring and tug till the moisture leaves it, and the fat soaks in for the many that pull at it, and it is well stretched\u2014\neven so did the two sides tug the dead body hither and thither within the compass of but a little space\u2014the Trojans\nsteadfastly set on drag ing it into Ilius, while the Achaeans were no less so on taking it to their ships; and fierce was\nthe fight between them. Not Mars himself the lord of hosts, nor yet Minerva, even in their fullest fury could make\nlight of such a battle.\nSuch fearful turmoil of men and horses did Jove on that day ordain round the body of Patroclus. Meanwhile\nAchilles did not know that he had fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy a long way off the ships. He had no\nidea, therefore, that Patroclus was dead, and deemed that he would return alive as soon as he had gone close up to\nthe gates. He knew that he was not to sack the city neither with nor without himself, for his mother had often told\nhim this when he had sat alone with her, and she had informed him of the counsels of great Jove. Now, however, she\nhad not told him how great a disaster had befallen him in the death of the one who was far dearest to him of all his\ncomrades.\nThe others still kept on charging one another round the body with their pointed spears and killing each other.\nThen would one say, \u201cMy friends, we can never again show our faces at the ships\u2014better, and greatly better, that\nearth should open and swallow us here in this place, than that we should let the Trojans have the triumph of bear-\ning off Patroclus to their city.\u201d\nThe Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying, \u201cFriends, though we fall to a man beside this body,\nlet none shrink from fighting.\u201d With such words did they exhort each other. They fought and fought, and an iron\nclank rose through the void air to the brazen vault of heaven. The horses of the descendant of Aeacus stood out of\nthe fight and wept when they heard that their driver had been laid low by the hand of murderous Hector. Autome-\ndon, valiant son of Diores, lashed them again and again; many a time did he speak kindly to them, and many a time\n195 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ndid he upbraid them, but they would neither go back to the ships by the waters of the broad Hellespont, nor yet into\nbattle among the Achaeans; they stood with their chariot stock still, as a pillar set over the tomb of some dead man\nor woman, and bowed their heads to the ground. Hot tears fell from their eyes as they mourned the loss of their\ncharioteer, and their noble manes drooped all wet from under the yokestraps on either side the yoke.\nThe son of Saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. He wagged his head, and muttered to himself,\nsaying, \u201cPoor things, why did we give you to King Peleus who is a mortal, while you are yourselves ageless and\nimmortal? Was it that you might share the sorrows that befall mankind? for of all creatures that live and move upon\nthe earth there is none so pitiable as he is\u2014still, Hector son of Priam shall drive neither you nor your chariot. I will\nnot have it. It is enough that he should have the armour over which he vaunts so vainly. Furthermore I will give you\nstrength of heart and limb to bear Automedon safely to the ships from battle, for I shall let the Trojans triumph still\nfurther, and go on killing till they reach the ships; whereon night shall fall and darkness overshadow the land.\u201d\nAs he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so that they shook the dust from out of their manes,\nand bore their chariot swiftly into the fight that raged between Trojans and Achaeans. Behind them fought Autom-\nedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vulture amid a flock of geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed he\ndashed amid the throng of the Trojans, but for all the fury of his pursuit he killed no man, for he could not wield his\nspear and keep his horses in hand when alone in the chariot; at last, however, a comrade, Alcimedon, son of Laerces\nson of Haemon caught sight of him and came up behind his chariot. \u201cAutomedon,\u201d said he, \u201cwhat god has put this\nfolly into your heart and robbed you of your right mind, that you fight the Trojans in the front rank single-handed?\nHe who was your comrade is slain, and Hector plumes himself on being armed in the armour of the descendant of\nAeacus.\u201d\nAutomedon son of Diores answered, \u201cAlcimedon, there is no one else who can control and guide the immortal\nsteeds so well as you can, save only Patroclus \u2014 while he was alive\u2014peer of gods in counsel. Take then the whip\nand reins, while I go down from the car and fight.\nAlcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and reins, while Automedon leaped from off the\ncar. When Hector saw him he said to Aeneas who was near him, \u201cAeneas, counsellor of the mail-clad Trojans, I see\nthe steeds of the fleet son of Aeacus come into battle with weak hands to drive them. I am sure, if you think well,\nthat we might take them; they will not dare face us if we both attack them.\u201d\nThe valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pair went right on, with their shoulders covered un-\nder shields of tough dry ox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromius and Aretus went also with them, and their\nhearts beat high with hope that they might kill the men and capture the horses \u2014 fools that they were, for they were\nnot to return scatheless from their meeting with Automedon, who prayed to father Jove and was forthwith filled\nwith courage and strength abounding. He turned to his trusty comrade Alcimedon and said, \u201cAlcimedon, keep your\nhorses so close up that I may feel their breath upon my back; I doubt that we shall not stay Hector son of Priam till\nhe has killed us and mounted behind the horses; he will then either spread panic among the ranks of the Achaeans,\nor himself be killed among the foremost.\u201d\nOn this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaus, \u201cAjaxes captains of the Argives, and Menelaus, give the\ndead body over to them that are best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of us living; for Hector and Aeneas\nwho are the two best men among the Trojans, are pressing us hard in the full tide of war. Nevertheless the issue lies\non the lap of heaven, I will therefore hurl my spear and leave the rest to Jove.\u201d\nHe poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the round shield of Aretus, and went right through\nit for the shield stayed it not, so that it was driven through his belt into the lower part of his belly. As when some\nsturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow behind the horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its neck\nso that it springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretus give one bound and then fall on his back the spear\nquivering in his body till it made an end of him. Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon but he saw it coming and\nstooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew past him and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on\nquivering till Mars robbed it of its force. They would then have fought hand to hand with swords had not the two\nAjaxes forced their way through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, and parted them for all their\nfury\u2014for Hector, Aeneas, and Chromius were afraid and drew back, leaving Aretus to lie there struck to the heart.\nAutomedon, peer of fleet Mars, then stripped him of his armour and vaunted over him saying, \u201cI have done little to\nassuage my sorrow for the son of Menoetius, for the man I have killed is not so good as he was.\u201d\nAs he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them upon his chariot; then he mounted the car with his\nhands and feet all steeped in gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull.\nAnd now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroclus, for Minerva came down from heaven and\nroused its fury by the command of far-seeing Jove, who had changed his mind and sent her to encourage the Da-\nnaans. As when Jove bends his bright bow in heaven in token to mankind either of war or of the chill storms that\nstay men from their labour and plague the flocks\u2014even so, wrapped in such radiant raiment, did Minerva go in\namong the host and speak man by man to each. First she took the form and voice of Phoenix and spoke to Mene-\n196 The Iliad\nlaus son of Atreus, who was standing near her. \u201cMenelaus,\u201d said she, \u201cit will be shame and dishonour to you, if dogs\ntear the noble comrade of Achilles under the walls of Troy. Therefore be staunch, and urge your men to be so also.\u201d\nMenelaus answered, \u201cPhoenix, my good old friend, may Minerva vouchsafe me strength and keep the darts\nfrom off me, for so shall I stand by Patroclus and defend him; his death has gone to my heart, but Hector is as a\nraging fire and deals his blows without ceasing, for Jove is now granting him a time of triumph.\u201d\nMinerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of the other gods. Therefore she put strength into\nhis knees and shoulders, and made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yet come again and bite if it\ncan, so dearly does it love man\u2019s blood\u2014even so bold as this did she make him as he stood over Patroclus and threw\nhis spear. Now there was among the Trojans a man named Podes, son of Eetion, who was both rich and valiant.\nHector held him in the highest honour for he was his comrade and boon companion; the spear of Menelaus struck\nthis man in the girdle just as he had turned in flight, and went right through him. Whereon he fell heavily forward,\nand Menelaus son of Atreus drew off his body from the Trojans into the ranks of his own people.\nApollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in the likeness of Phaenops son of Asius who lived\nin Abydos and was the most favoured of all Hector\u2019s guests. In his likeness Apollo said, \u201cHector, who of the Achae-\nans will fear you henceforward now that you have quailed before Menelaus who has ever been rated poorly as a\nsoldier? Yet he has now got a corpse away from the Trojans single-handed, and has slain your own true comrade, a\nman brave among the foremost, Podes son of Eetion.\nA dark cloud of grief fell upon Hector as he heard, and he made his way to the front clad in full armour. There-\non the son of Saturn seized his bright tasselled aegis, and veiled Ida in cloud: he sent forth his lightnings and his\nthunders, and as he shook his aegis he gave victory to the Trojans and routed the Achaeans.\nThe panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keeping his face turned ever towards the foe he had\nbeen hit with a spear on the upper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas had grazed the top of the\nbone, for Polydamas had come up to him and struck him from close at hand. Then Hector in close combat struck\nLeitus son of noble Alectryon in the hand by the wrist, and disabled him from fighting further. He looked about\nhim in dismay, knowing that never again should he wield spear in battle with the Trojans. While Hector was in\npursuit of Leitus, Idomeneus struck him on the breastplate over his chest near the nipple; but the spear broke in the\nshaft, and the Trojans cheered aloud. Hector then aimed at Idomeneus son of Deucalion as he was standing on his\nchariot, and very narrowly missed him, but the spear hit Coiranus, a follower and charioteer of Meriones who had\ncome with him from Lyctus. Idomeneus had left the ships on foot and would have afforded a great triumph to the\nTrojans if Coiranus had not driven quickly up to him, he therefore brought life and rescue to Idomeneus, but him-\nself fell by the hand of murderous Hector. For Hector hit him on the jaw under the ear; the end of the spear drove\nout his teeth and cut his tongue in two pieces, so that he fell from his chariot and let the reins fall to the ground.\nMeriones gathered them up from the ground and took them into his own hands, then he said to Idomeneus, \u201cLay\non, till you get back to the ships, for you must see that the day is no longer ours.\u201d\nOn this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had taken hold upon him.\nAjax and Menelaus noted how Jove had turned the scale in favour of the Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak.\n\u201cAlas,\u201d said he, \u201ceven a fool may see that father Jove is helping the Trojans. All their weapons strike home; no matter\nwhether it be a brave man or a coward that hurls them, Jove speeds all alike, whereas ours fall each one of them\nwithout effect. What, then, will be best both as regards rescuing the body, and our return to the joy of our friends\nwho will be grieving as they look hitherwards; for they will make sure that nothing can now check the terrible\nhands of Hector, and that he will fling himself upon our ships. I wish that some one would go and tell the son of\nPeleus at once, for I do not think he can have yet heard the sad news that the dearest of his friends has fallen. But I\ncan see not a man among the Achaeans to send, for they and their chariots are alike hidden in darkness. O father\nJove, lift this cloud from over the sons of the Achaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if you will that we per-\nish, let us fall at any rate by daylight.\u201d\nFather Jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears. Forthwith he chased away the cloud of darkness, so\nthat the sun shone out and all the fighting was revealed. Ajax then said to Menelaus, \u201cLook, Menelaus, and if Anti-\nlochus son of Nestor be still living, send him at once to tell Achilles that by far the dearest to him of all his comrades\nhas fallen.\u201d\nMenelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a stockyard\u2014the lion is tired of attacking the men\nand hounds, who keep watch the whole night through and will not let him feast on the fat of their herd. In his lust\nof meat he makes straight at them but in vain, for darts from strong hands assail him, and burning brands which\ndaunt him for all his hunger, so in the morning he slinks sulkily away\u2014even so did Menelaus sorely against his\nwill leave Patroclus, in great fear lest the Achaeans should be driven back in rout and let him fall into the hands of\nthe foe. He charged Meriones and the two Ajaxes straitly saying, \u201cAjaxes and Meriones, leaders of the Argives, now\nindeed remember how good Patroclus was; he was ever courteous while alive, bear it in mind now that he is dead.\u201d\nWith this Menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as an eagle, whose sight they say is keener than that\n197 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nof any other bird\u2014however high he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escape him by crouching under\nbush or thicket, for he will swoop down upon it and make an end of it\u2014even so, O Menelaus, did your keen eyes\nrange round the mighty host of your followers to see if you could find the son of Nestor still alive. Presently Me-\nnelaus saw him on the extreme left of the battle cheering on his men and exhorting them to fight boldly. Menelaus\nwent up to him and said, \u201cAntilochus, come here and listen to sad news, which I would indeed were untrue. You\nmust see with your own eyes that heaven is heaping calamity upon the Danaans, and giving victory to the Trojans.\nPatroclus has fallen, who was the bravest of the Achaeans, and sorely will the Danaans miss him. Run instantly to\nthe ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to rescue the body and bear it to the ships. As for the armour, Hector\nalready has it.\u201d\nAntilochus was struck with horror. For a long time he was speechless; his eyes filled with tears and he could\nfind no utterance, but he did as Menelaus had said, and set off running as soon as he had given his armour to a\ncomrade, Laodocus, who was wheeling his horses round, close beside him.\nThus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad news to Achilles son of Peleus. Nor were you, O\nMenelaus, minded to succour his harassed comrades, when Antilochus had left the Pylians\u2014and greatly did they\nmiss him\u2014but he sent them noble Thrasymedes, and himself went back to Patroclus. He came running up to the\ntwo Ajaxes and said, \u201cI have sent Antilochus to the ships to tell Achilles, but rage against Hector as he may, he can-\nnot come, for he cannot fight without armour. What then will be our best plan both as regards rescuing the dead,\nand our own escape from death amid the battle-cries of the Trojans?\u201d\nAjax answered, \u201cMenelaus, you have said well: do you, then, and Meriones stoop down, raise the body, and bear\nit out of the fray, while we two behind you keep off Hector and the Trojans, one in heart as in name, and long used\nto fighting side by side with one another.\u201d\nOn this Menelaus and Meriones took the dead man in their arms and lifted him high aloft with a great effort.\nThe Trojan host raised a hue and cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the body away, and flew af-\nter them like hounds attacking a wounded boar at the loo of a band of young huntsmen. For a while the hounds fly\nat him as though they would tear him in pieces, but now and again he turns on them in a fury, scaring and scatter-\ning them in all directions\u2014even so did the Trojans for a while charge in a body, striking with sword and with spears\npointed ai both the ends, but when the two Ajaxes faced them and stood at bay, they would turn pale and no man\ndared press on to fight further about the dead.\nIn this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the body to the ships out of the fight. The battle raged\nround them like fierce flames that when once kindled spread like wildfire over a city, and the houses fall in the glare\nof its burning\u2014even such was the roar and tramp of men and horses that pursued them as they bore Patroclus\nfrom the field. Or as mules that put forth all their strength to draw some beam or great piece of ship\u2019s timber down\na rough mountain-track, and they pant and sweat as they, go even so did Menelaus and pant and sweat as they bore\nthe body of Patroclus. Behind them the two Ajaxes held stoutly out. As some wooded mountain-spur that stretch-\nes across a plain will turn water and check the flow even of a great river, nor is there any stream strong enough to\nbreak through it\u2014even so did the two Ajaxes face the Trojans and stern the tide of their fighting though they kept\npouring on towards them and foremost among them all was Aeneas son of Anchises with valiant Hector. As a flock\nof daws or starlings fall to screaming and chattering when they see a falcon, foe to i\u2019ll small birds, come soaring\nnear them, even so did the Achaean youth raise a babel of cries as they fled before Aeneas and Hector, unmindful of\ntheir former prowess. In the rout of the Danaans much goodly armour fell round about the trench, and of fighting\nthere was no end.\nBook XVIII\nTHUS then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the fleet runner Antilochus, who had been sent\nas messenger, reached Achilles, and found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that which was indeed too surely\ntrue. \u201cAlas,\u201d said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, \u201cwhy are the Achaeans again scouring the plain and\nflocking towards the ships? Heaven grant the gods be not now bringing that sorrow upon me of which my mother\nThetis spoke, saying that while I was yet alive the bravest of the Myrmidons should fall before the Trojans, and see\nthe light of the sun no longer. I fear the brave son of Menoetius has fallen through his own daring and yet I bade\nhim return to the ships as soon as he had driven back those that were bringing fire against them, and not join battle\nwith Hector.\u201d\nAs he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him and told his sad tale, weeping bitterly the while.\n\u201cAlas,\u201d he cried, \u201cson of noble Peleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed that they were untrue. Patroclus has\nfallen, and a fight is raging about his naked body\u2014for Hector holds his armour.\u201d\nA dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He filled both hands with dust from off the ground, and\npoured it over his head, disfiguring his comely face, and letting the refuse settle over his shirt so fair and new. He\n198 The Iliad\nflung himself down all huge and hugely at full length, and tore his hair with his hands. The bondswomen whom\nAchilles and Patroclus had taken captive screamed aloud for grief, beating their breasts, and with their limbs failing\nthem for sorrow. Antilochus bent over him the while, weeping and holding both his hands as he lay groaning for\nhe feared that he might plunge a knife into his own throat. Then Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard him\nas she was sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her father, whereon she screamed, and all the goddesses\ndaughters of Nereus that dwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. There were Glauce, Thalia and\nCymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, thoe and dark-eyed Halie, Cymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera, Amphithoe\nand Agave, Doto and Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome and Callianeira, Doris, Panope, and\nthe famous sea-nymph Galatea, Nemertes, Apseudes and Callianassa. There were also Clymene, Ianeira and Ianas-\nsa, Maera, Oreithuia and Amatheia of the lovely locks, with other Nereids who dwell in the depths of the sea. The\ncrystal cave was filled with their multitude and they all beat their breasts while Thetis led them in their lament.\n\u201cListen,\u201d she cried, \u201csisters, daughters of Nereus, that you may hear the burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me,\nwoe in that I have borne the most glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and strong, hero among heroes, and he shot\nup as a sapling; I tended him as a plant in a goodly garden, and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight the Trojans,\nbut never shall I welcome him back to the house of Peleus. So long as he lives to look upon the light of the sun he is\nin heaviness, and though I go to him I cannot help him. Nevertheless I will go, that I may see my dear son and learn\nwhat sorrow has befallen him though he is still holding aloof from battle.\u201d\nShe left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping after, and the waves opened a path before\nthem. When they reached the rich plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long line on to the sands, at the\nplace where the ships of the Myrmidons were drawn up in close order round the tents of Achilles. His mother went\nup to him as he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head and spoke piteously, saying, \u201cMy son, why are you\nthus weeping? What sorrow has now befallen you? Tell me; hide it not from me. Surely Jove has granted you the\nprayer you made him, when you lifted up your hands and besought him that the Achaeans might all of them be\npent up at their ships, and rue it bitterly in that you were no longer with them.\u201d\nAchilles groaned and answered, \u201cMother, Olympian Jove has indeed vouchsafed me the fulfilment of my prayer,\nbut what boots it to me, seeing that my dear comrade Patroclus has fallen\u2014he whom I valued more than all others,\nand loved as dearly as my own life? I have lost him; aye, and Hector when he had killed him stripped the wondrous\narmour, so glorious to behold, which the gods gave to Peleus when they laid you in the couch of a mortal man.\nWould that you were still dwelling among the immortal sea-nymphs, and that Peleus had taken to himself some\nmortal bride. For now you shall have grief infinite by reason of the death of that son whom you can never welcome\nhome\u2014nay, I will not live nor go about among mankind unless Hector fall by my spear, and thus pay me for having\nslain Patroclus son of Menoetius.\u201d\nThetis wept and answered, \u201cThen, my son, is your end near at hand\u2014for your own death awaits you full soon\nafter that of Hector.\u201d\nThen said Achilles in his great grief, \u201cI would die here and now, in that I could not save my comrade. He has\nfallen far from home, and in his hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What is there for me? Return to\nmy own land I shall not, and I have brought no saving neither to Patroclus nor to my other comrades of whom so\nmany have been slain by mighty Hector; I stay here by my ships a bootless burden upon the earth, I, who in fight\nhave no peer among the Achaeans, though in council there are better than I. Therefore, perish strife both from\namong gods and men, and anger, wherein even a righteous man will harden his heart\u2014which rises up in the soul of\na man like smoke, and the taste thereof is sweeter than drops of honey. Even so has Agamemnon angered me. And\nyet\u2014so be it, for it is over; I will force my soul into subjection as I needs must; I will go; I will pursue Hector who\nhas slain him whom I loved so dearly, and will then abide my doom when it may please Jove and the other gods to\nsend it. Even Hercules, the best beloved of Jove\u2014even he could not escape the hand of death, but fate and Juno\u2019s\nfierce anger laid him low, as I too shall lie when I am dead if a like doom awaits me. Till then I will win fame, and\nwill bid Trojan and Dardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks with both their hands in the grievous-\nness of their great sorrow; thus shall they know that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no longer. Hold\nme not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for you shall not move me.\u201d\nThen silver-footed Thetis answered, \u201cMy son, what you have said is true. It is well to save your comrades from\ndestruction, but your armour is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in triumph upon his own shoulders.\nFull well I know that his vaunt shall not be lasting, for his end is close at hand; go not, however, into the press of\nbattle till you see me return hither; to-morrow at break of day I shall be here, and will bring you goodly armour\nfrom King Vulcan.\u201d\nOn this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said to the sea-nymphs her sisters, \u201cDive into the\nbosom of the sea and go to the house of the old sea-god my father. Tell him everything; as for me, I will go to the\ncunning workman Vulcan on high Olympus, and ask him to provide my son with a suit of splendid armour.\u201d\nWhen she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves, while silver-footed Thetis went her way that she\n199 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nmight bring the armour for her son.\nThus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, and meanwhile the Achaeans were flying with loud cries\nbefore murderous Hector till they reached the ships and the Hellespont, and they could not draw the body of Mars\u2019s\nservant Patroclus out of reach of the weapons that were showered upon him, for Hector son of Priam with his host\nand horsemen had again caught up to him like the flame of a fiery furnace; thrice did brave Hector seize him by the\nfeet, striving with might and main to draw him away and calling loudly on the Trojans, and thrice did the two Ajax-\nes, clothed in valour as with a garment, beat him from off the body; but all undaunted he would now charge into\nthe thick of the fight, and now again he would stand still and cry aloud, but he would give no ground. As upland\nshepherds that cannot chase some famished lion from a carcase, even so could not the two Ajaxes scare Hector son\nof Priam from the body of Patroclus.\nAnd now he would even have dragged it off and have won imperishable glory, had not Iris fleet as the wind,\nwinged her way as messenger from Olympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him arm. She came secretly without\nthe knowledge of Jove and of the other gods, for Juno sent her, and when she had got close to him she said, \u201cUp, son\nof Peleus, mightiest of all mankind; rescue Patroclus about whom this fearful fight is now raging by the ships. Men\nare killing one another, the Danaans in defence of the dead body, while the Trojans are trying to hale it away, and\ntake it to wind Ilius: Hector is the most furious of them all; he is for cutting the head from the body and fixing it on\nthe stakes of the wall. Up, then, and bide here no longer; shrink from the thought that Patroclus may become meat\nfor the dogs of Troy. Shame on you, should his body suffer any kind of outrage.\u201d\nAnd Achilles said, \u201cIris, which of the gods was it that sent you to me?\u201d\nIris answered, \u201cIt was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son of Saturn does not know of my coming, nor yet\ndoes any other of the immortals who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus.\u201d\nThen fleet Achilles answered her saying, \u201cHow can I go up into the battle? They have my armour. My mother\nforbade me to arm till I should see her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour from Vulcan; I know no\nman whose arms I can put on, save only the shield of Ajax son of Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the\nfront rank and wielding his spear about the body of dead Patroclus.\u201d\nIris said, \u2018We know that your armour has been taken, but go as you are; go to the deep trench and show yourelf\nbefore the Trojans, that they may fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the fainting sons of the Achaeans gain some\nbrief breathing-time, which in battle may hardly be.\u201d\nIris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jove arose, and Minerva flung her tasselled aegis\nround his strong shoulders; she crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from which she kindled a glow of\ngleaming fire. As the smoke that goes up into heaven from some city that is being beleaguered on an island far out\nat sea\u2014all day long do men sally from the city and fight their hardest, and at the going down of the sun the line of\nbeacon-fires blazes forth, flaring high for those that dwell near them to behold, if so be that they may come with\ntheir ships and succour them\u2014even so did the light flare from the head of Achilles, as he stood by the trench, going\nbeyond the wall \u2014 but he aid not join the Achaeans for he heeded the charge which his mother laid upon him.\nThere did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voice from afar, and spread terror unspeakable\namong the Trojans. Ringing as the note of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe is at the gates of a city, even so\nbrazen was the voice of the son of Aeacus, and when the Trojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed; the\nhorses turned back with their chariots for they boded mischief, and their drivers were awe-struck by the steady\nflame which the grey-eyed goddess had kindled above the head of the great son of Peleus.\nThrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench, and thrice were the Trojans and their brave al-\nlies thrown into confusion; whereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath the wheels of their chariots and\nperished by their own spears. The Achaeans to their great joy then drew Patroclus out of reach of the weapons, and\nlaid him on a litter: his comrades stood mourning round him, and among them fleet Achilles who wept bitterly as\nhe saw his true comrade lying dead upon his bier. He had sent him out with horses and chariots into battle, but his\nreturn he was not to welcome.\nThen Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters of Oceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had\nrest from the tug and turmoil of war.\nNow the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked their horses and gathered in assembly before\npreparing their supper. They kept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had fallen upon them all be-\ncause Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so long from battle. Polydamas son of Panthous was first\nto speak, a man of judgement, who alone among them could look both before and after. He was comrade to Hector,\nand they had been born upon the same night; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:\u2014\n\u201cLook to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now to your city and not wait here by the ships till\nmorning, for we are far from our walls. So long as this man was at enmity with Agamemnon the Achaeans were\neasier to deal with, and I would have gladly camped by the ships in the hope of taking them; but now I go in great\nfear of the fleet son of Peleus; he is so daring that he will never bide here on the plain whereon the Trojans and\n200 The Iliad\nAchaeans fight with equal valour, but he will try to storm our city and carry off our women. Do then as I say, and\nlet us retreat. For this is what will happen. The darkness of night will for a time stay the son of Peleus, but if he find\nus here in the morning when he sallies forth in full armour, we shall have knowledge of him in good earnest. Glad\nindeed will he be who can escape and get back to Ilius, and many a Trojan will become meat for dogs and vultures\nmay I never live to hear it. If we do as I say, little though we may like it, we shall have strength in counsel during\nthe night, and the great gates with the doors that close them will protect the city. At dawn we can arm and take our\nstand on the walls; he will then rue it if he sallies from the ships to fight us. He will go back when he has given his\nhorses their fill of being driven all whithers under our walls, and will be in no mind to try and force his way into the\ncity. Neither will he ever sack it, dogs shall devour him ere he do so.\u201d\nHector looked fiercely at him and answered, \u201cPolydamas, your words are not to my liking in that you bid us go\nback and be pent within the city. Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls? In the old-days the\ncity of Priam was famous the whole world over for its wealth of gold and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out\nof our houses, and much goods have been sold away to Phrygia and fair Meonia, for the hand of Jove has been laid\nheavily upon us. Now, therefore, that the son of scheming Saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory here and to hem\nthe Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in this fool\u2019s wise among the people. You will have no man with you;\nit shall not be; do all of you as I now say;\u2014take your suppers in your companies throughout the host, and keep\nyour watches and be wakeful every man of you. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, let him gather them\nand give them out among the people. Better let these, rather than the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will\narm and fight about the ships; granted that Achilles has again come forward to defend them, let it be as he will, but\nit shall go hard with him. I shall not shun him, but will fight him, to fall or conquer. The god of war deals out like\nmeasure to all, and the slayer may yet be slain.\u201d\nThus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted in applause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed\nthem of their understanding. They gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but the wise words of Polydamas no\nman would heed. They took their supper throughout the host, and meanwhile through the whole night the Achae-\nans mourned Patroclus, and the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid his murderous hands upon the\nbreast of his comrade, groaning again and again as a bearded lion when a man who was chasing deer has robbed\nhim of his young in some dense forest; when the lion comes back he is furious, and searches dingle and dell to track\nthe hunter if he can find him, for he is mad with rage\u2014even so with many a sigh did Achilles speak among the\nMyrmidons saying, \u201cAlas! vain were the words with which I cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I said\nthat I would bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had sacked Ilius and taken his share of the spoils\u2014\nbut Jove does not give all men their heart\u2019s desire. The same soil shall be reddened here at Troy by the blood of us\nboth, for I too shall never be welcomed home by the old knight Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis, but even in this\nplace shall the earth cover me. Nevertheless, O Patroclus, now that I am left behind you, I will not bury you, till I\nhave brought hither the head and armour of mighty Hector who has slain you. Twelve noble sons of Trojans will\nI behead before your bier to avenge you; till I have done so you shall lie as you are by the ships, and fair women of\nTroy and Dardanus, whom we have taken with spear and strength of arm when we sacked men\u2019s goodly cities, shall\nweep over you both night and day.\u201d\nThen Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire that they might wash the clotted gore from off Pa-\ntroclus. Thereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they threw sticks on to it to make it blaze, and\nthe water became hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod. When the water in the cauldron was boiling\nthey washed the body, anointed it with oil, and closed its wounds with ointment that had been kept nine years.\nThen they laid it on a bier and covered it with a linen cloth from head to foot, and over this they laid a fair white\nrobe. Thus all night long did the Myrmidons gather round Achilles to mourn Patroclus.\nThen Jove said to Juno his sister-wife, \u201cSo, Queen Juno, you have gained your end, and have roused fleet Achil-\nles. One would think that the Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood.\u201d\nAnd Juno answered, \u201cDread son of Saturn, why should you say this thing? May not a man though he be only\nmortal and knows less than we do, do what he can for another person? And shall not I\u2014foremost of all goddesses\nboth by descent and as wife to you who reign in heaven \u2014 devise evil for the Trojans if I am angry with them?\u201d\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of Vulcan, imperishable, star-bespangled, fairest\nof the abodes in heaven, a house of bronze wrought by the lame god\u2019s own hands. She found him busy with his\nbellows, sweating and hard at work, for he was making twenty tripods that were to stand by the wall of his house,\nand he set wheels of gold under them all that they might go of their own selves to the assemblies of the gods, and\ncome back again\u2014marvels indeed to see. They were finished all but the ears of cunning workmanship which yet\nremained to be fixed to them: these he was now fixing, and he was hammering at the rivets. While he was thus at\nwork silver-footed Thetis came to the house. Charis, of graceful head-dress, wife to the far-famed lame god, came\ntowards her as soon as she saw her, and took her hand in her own, saying, \u201cWhy have you come to our house, The-\ntis, honoured and ever welcome\u2014for you do not visit us often? Come inside and let me set refreshment before you.\u201d\n201 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThe goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was\na footstool also under her feet. Then she called Vulcan and said, \u201cVulcan, come here, Thetis wants you\u201d; and the\nfar-famed lame god answered, \u201cThen it is indeed an august and honoured goddess who has come here; she it was\nthat took care of me when I was suffering from the heavy fall which I had through my cruel mother\u2019s anger\u2014for\nshe would have got rid of me because I was lame. It would have gone hardly with me had not Eurynome, daughter\nof the ever-encircling waters of Oceanus, and Thetis, taken me to their bosom. Nine years did I stay with them, and\nmany beautiful works in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, cups, and chains, did I make for them in their cave, with\nthe roaring waters of Oceanus foaming as they rushed ever past it; and no one knew, neither of gods nor men, save\nonly Thetis and Eurynome who took care of me. If, then, Thetis has come to my house I must make her due requital\nfor having saved me; entertain her, therefore, with all hospitality, while I put by my bellows and all my tools.\u201d\nOn this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin legs plying lustily under him. He set the bellows\naway from the fire, and gathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a sponge and washed his face and hands,\nhis shaggy chest and brawny neck; he donned his shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the door. There\nwere golden handmaids also who worked for him, and were like real young women, with sense and reason, voice\nalso and strength, and all the learning of the immortals; these busied themselves as the king bade them, while he\ndrew near to Thetis, seated her upon a goodly seat, and took her hand in his own, saying, \u201cWhy have you come to\nour house, Thetis honoured and ever welcome\u2014for you do not visit us often? Say what you want, and I will do it for\nyou at once if I can, and if it can be done at all.\u201d\nThetis wept and answered, \u201cVulcan, is there another goddess in Olympus whom the son of Saturn has been\npleased to try with so much affliction as he has me? Me alone of the marine goddesses did he make subject to a\nmortal husband, Peleus son of Aeacus, and sorely against my will did I submit to the embraces of one who was but\nmortal, and who now stays at home worn out with age. Neither is this all. Heaven vouchsafed me a son, hero among\nheroes, and he shot up as a sapling. I tended him as a plant in a goodly garden and sent him with his ships to Ilius\nto fight the Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house of Peleus. So long as he lives to look upon the\nlight of the sun, he is in heaviness, and though I go to him I cannot help him; King Agamemnon has made him give\nup the maiden whom the sons of the Achaeans had awarded him, and he wastes with sorrow for her sake. Then the\nTrojans hemmed the Achaeans in at their ships\u2019 sterns and would not let them come forth; the elders, therefore,\nof the Argives besought Achilles and offered him great treasure, whereon he refused to bring deliverance to them\nhimself, but put his own armour on Patroclus and sent him into the fight with much people after him. All day long\nthey fought by the Scaean gates and would have taken the city there and then, had not Apollo vouchsafed glory to\nHector and slain the valiant son of Menoetius after he had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore I am suppliant at\nyour knees if haply you may be pleased to provide my son, whose end is near at hand, with helmet and shield, with\ngoodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost his own when his true comrade fell at the\nhands of the Trojans, and he now lies stretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul.\u201d\nAnd Vulcan answered, \u201cTake heart, and be no more disquieted about this matter; would that I could hide him\nfrom death\u2019s sight when his hour is come, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amaze the eyes of all who\nbehold it.\u201d\nWhen he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning them towards the fire and bidding them do\ntheir office. Twenty bellows blew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some fierce to help\nhim when he had need of them, and others less strong as Vulcan willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough\ncopper into the fire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on its block, and with one hand grasped his\nmighty hammer while he took the tongs in the other.\nFirst he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all over and binding it round with a gleaming circuit\nin three layers; and the baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in five thicknesses, and with many a wonder\ndid his cunning hand enrich it.\nHe wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at her full and the untiring sun, with all the signs\nthat glorify the face of heaven\u2014the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which men also call the Wain and\nwhich turns round ever in one place, facing. Orion, and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus.\nHe wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of men. In the one were weddings and wed-\nding-feasts, and they were going about the city with brides whom they were escorting by torchlight from their\nchambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and the youths danced to the music of flute and lyre, while the women\nstood each at her house door to see them.\nMeanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was a quarrel, and two men were wrangling about\nthe blood-money for a man who had been killed, the one saying before the people that he had paid damages in full,\nand the other that he had not been paid. Each was trying to make his own case good, and the people took sides,\neach man backing the side that he had taken; but the heralds kept them back, and the elders sate on their seats of\nstone in a solemn circle, holding the staves which the heralds had put into their hands. Then they rose and each\n202 The Iliad\nin his turn gave judgement, and there were two talents laid down, to be given to him whose judgement should be\ndeemed the fairest.\nAbout the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming armour, and they were divided whether to sack\nit, or to spare it and accept the half of what it contained. But the men of the city would not yet consent, and armed\nthemselves for a surprise; their wives and little children kept guard upon the walls, and with them were the men\nwho were past fighting through age; but the others sallied forth with Mars and Pallas Minerva at their head\u2014both\nof them wrought in gold and clad in golden raiment, great and fair with their armour as befitting gods, while they\nthat followed were smaller. When they reached the place where they would lay their ambush, it was on a riverbed to\nwhich live stock of all kinds would come from far and near to water; here, then, they lay concealed, clad in full ar-\nmour. Some way off them there were two scouts who were on the look-out for the coming of sheep or cattle, which\npresently came, followed by two shepherds who were playing on their pipes, and had not so much as a thought of\ndanger. When those who were in ambush saw this, they cut off the flocks and herds and killed the shepherds. Mean-\nwhile the besiegers, when they heard much noise among the cattle as they sat in council, sprang to their horses, and\nmade with all speed towards them; when they reached them they set battle in array by the banks of the river, and\nthe hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another. With them were Strife and Riot, and fell Fate who was\ndragging three men after her, one with a fresh wound, and the other unwounded, while the third was dead, and she\nwas dragging him along by his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled in men\u2019s blood. They went in and out with one\nanother and fought as though they were living people haling away one another\u2019s dead.\nHe wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed already. Many men were working at the plough\nwithin it, turning their oxen to and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turned on reaching the headland a\nman would come up to them and give them a cup of wine, and they would go back to their furrows looking forward\nto the time when they should again reach the headland. The part that they had ploughed was dark behind them, so\nthat the field, though it was of gold, still looked as if it were being ploughed\u2014very curious to behold.\nHe wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were reaping with sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe\nafter swathe fell to the ground in a straight line behind them, and the binders bound them in bands of twisted\nstraw. There were three binders, and behind them there were boys who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kept\non bringing them to be bound: among them all the owner of the land stood by in silence and was glad. The servants\nwere getting a meal ready under an oak, for they had sacrificed a great ox, and were busy cutting him up, while the\nwomen were making a porridge of much white barley for the labourers\u2019 dinner.\nHe wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines were loaded with grapes. The bunches over-\nhead were black, but the vines were trained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metal all round it, and fenced it\nwith a fence of tin; there was only one path to it, and by this the vintagers went when they would gather the vintage.\nYouths and maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried the luscious fruit in plaited baskets; and with them there went\na boy who made sweet music with his lyre, and sang the Linus-song with his clear boyish voice.\nHe wrought also a herd of homed cattle. He made the cows of gold and tin, and they lowed as they came full\nspeed out of the yards to go and feed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river. Along with the\ncattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold, and their nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions\nhad fastened on a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, and bellow as he might they haled him, while the\ndogs and men gave chase: the lions tore through the bull\u2019s thick hide and were gorging on his blood and bowels, but\nthe herdsmen were afraid to do anything, and only hounded on their dogs; the dogs dared not fasten on the lions\nbut stood by barking and keeping out of harm\u2019s way.\nThe god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and large flock of sheep, with a homestead and huts,\nand sheltered sheepfolds.\nFurthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once made in Cnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon\nthere danced youths and maidens whom all would woo, with their hands on one another\u2019s wrists. The maidens wore\nrobes of light linen, and the youths well woven shirts that were slightly oiled. The girls were crowned with garlands,\nwhile the young men had daggers of gold that hung by silver baldrics; sometimes they would dance deftly in a ring\nwith merry twinkling feet, as it were a potter sitting at his work and making trial of his wheel to see whether it will\nrun, and sometimes they would go all in line with one another, and much people was gathered joyously about the\ngreen. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the\nmidst of them when the man struck up with his tune.\nAll round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty stream of the river Oceanus.\nThen when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made a breastplate also that shone brighter than\nfire. He made helmet, close fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume overhanging it; and he made\ngreaves also of beaten tin.\nLastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took it and set it before the mother of Achilles;\nwhereon she darted like a falcon from the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the gleaming armour from\n203 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthe house of Vulcan.\nBook XIX\nNOW when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of Oceanus, to bring light to mortals and\nimmortals, Thetis reached the ships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son fallen about the\nbody of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also of his followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess\ncame among them she clasped his hand in her own, saying, \u201cMy son, grieve as we may we must let this man lie, for\nit is by heaven\u2019s will that he has fallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly armour, which no\nman has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.\u201d\nAs she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out bravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were\nstruck with awe, and none dared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to still greater fury, and\nhis eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for he was glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had made\nhim. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at it, he said to his mother, \u201cMother, the god has given\nme armour, meet handiwork for an immortal and such as no living could have fashioned; I will now arm, but I\nmuch fear that flies will settle upon the son of Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his body, now\nhe is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.\u201d\nSilver-footed Thetis answered, \u201cMy son, be not disquieted about this matter. I will find means to protect him\nfrom the swarms of noisome flies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle. He may lie for a\nwhole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound as ever, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in as-\nsembly; unsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might and main.\u201d\nAs she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she then dropped ambrosia and red nectar into\nthe wounds of Patroclus, that his body might suffer no change.\nThen Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called on the Achaean heroes. On this even\nthose who as yet had stayed always at the ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were about\nthe ships and served out rations, all came to the place of assembly because Achilles had shown himself after having\nheld aloof so long from fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of Tydeus, came limping, for their wounds\nstill pained them; nevertheless they came, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last of all came\nAgamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of Antenor had struck him with a spear in battle.\nWhen the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, \u201cSon of Atreus, surely it would have been better\nalike for both you and me, when we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would have been better,\nhad Diana\u2019s arrow slain her at the ships on the day when I took her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an\nAchaean the less would have bitten dust before the foe in the days of my anger. It has been well for Hector and the\nTrojans, but the Achaeans will long indeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let it be, for it is over. If we have\nbeen angry, necessity has schooled our anger. I put it from me: I dare not nurse it for ever; therefore, bid the Achae-\nans arm forthwith that I may go out against the Trojans, and learn whether they will be in a mind to sleep by the\nships or no. Glad, I ween, will he be to rest his knees who may fly my spear when I wield it.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away his anger.\nThen Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the middle of the assembly. \u201cDanaan heroes,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cservants of Mars, it is well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not seemly to interrupt him,\nor it will go hard even with a practised speaker. Who can either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest orator\nwill be disconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus, and do you other Achaeans heed me and mark me\nwell. Often have the Achaeans spoken to me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was not I that did it: Jove, and\nFate, and Erinys that walks in darkness struck me mad when we were assembled on the day that I took from Achil-\nles the meed that had been awarded to him. What could I do? All things are in the hand of heaven, and Folly, eldest\nof Jove\u2019s daughters, shuts men\u2019s eyes to their destruction. She walks delicately, not on the solid earth, but hovers over\nthe heads of men to make them stumble or to ensnare them.\n\u201cTime was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest whether of gods or men; for Juno, woman\nthough she was, beguiled him on the day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair city of The-\nbes. He told it out among the gods saying, \u2018Hear me all gods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded;\nthis day shall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man child into the world who shall be lord\nover all that dwell about him who are of my blood and lineage.\u2019 Then said Juno all crafty and full of guile, \u2018You will\nplay false, and will not hold to your word. Swear me, O Olympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this day\nfall between the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that dwell about him who are of your blood and lineage.\u2019\n\u201cThus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great oath, to his much ruing thereafter. For Juno\ndarted down from the high summit of Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that the\nnoble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being with child and in her seventh month, Juno brought the\n204 The Iliad\nchild to birth though there was a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of Alcmena, and kept back the\nIlithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove the son of Saturn, and said, \u2018Father Jove, lord of the lightning\u2014I have a word for\nyour ear. There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus the son of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it\nis well, therefore, that he should reign over the Argives.\u2019\n\u201cOn this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught Folly by the hair, and swore a great oath\nthat never should she again invade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all. Then he whirled her\nround with a twist of his hand, and flung her down from heaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and\nhe was ever angry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel labours that Eurystheus laid upon him.\nEven so did I grieve when mighty Hector was killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time I kept thinking of\nFolly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove robbed me of my reason; I will now make atonement, and will\nadd much treasure by way of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your people with you. I will give you all\nthat Ulysses offered you yesterday in your tents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain fight at once, and\nmy squires shall bring the gifts from my ship, that you may see whether what I give you is enough.\u201d\nAnd Achilles answered, \u201cSon of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you can give such gifts as you think proper,\nor you can withhold them: it is in your own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not well to tarry talking about\ntrifles, for there is a deed which is as yet to do. Achilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost, and laying\nlow the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one of you when he is fighting.\u201d\nThen Ulysses said, \u201cAchilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans thus against Ilius to fight the Trojans\nfasting, for the battle will be no brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both sides with fury; bid\nthem first take food both bread and wine by the ships, for in this there is strength and stay. No man can do battle\nthe livelong day to the going down of the sun if he is without food; however much he may want to fight his strength\nwill fail him before he knows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will grow weary under him. But\na man can fight all day if he is full fed with meat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay till he has\nrouted all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid them prepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring\nout the gifts in presence of the assembly, that all may see them and you may be satisfied. Moreover let him swear\nan oath before the Argives that he has never gone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with her after the manner\nof men and women; and do you, too, show yourself of a gracious mind; let Agamemnon entertain you in his tents\nwith a feast of reconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full. As for you, son of Atreus, treat people\nmore righteously in future; it is no disgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he was wrong in the first\ninstance.\u201d\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \u201cSon of Laertes, your words please me well, for throughout you have spoken\nwisely. I will swear as you would have me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the name of heaven\nin vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fain fight at once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come\nfrom my tent and we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge you: take some noble young Achaeans\nwith you, and bring from my tents the gifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring the women also; fur-\nthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those that are with the host, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and\nto the sun.\u201d\nThen said Achilles, \u201cSon of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to these matters at some other season, when\nthere is breathing time and when I am calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those whom Hector son\nof Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain? Let the sons of the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and without\nfood, till we have avenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun let them eat their fill. As for me, Patroclus\nis lying dead in my tent, all hacked and hewn, with his feet to the door, and his comrades are mourning round him.\nTherefore I can take thought of nothing save only slaughter and blood and the rattle in the throat of the dying.\u201d\nUlysses answered, \u201cAchilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the Achaeans, in battle you are better than I, and\nthat more than a little, but in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of greater knowledge. Therefore be\npatient under my words. Fighting is a thing of which men soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is wars steward, weighs\nthe upshot, it may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped is far heavier than the grain. It may not\nbe that the Achaeans should mourn the dead with their bellies; day by day men fall thick and threefold continually;\nwhen should we have respite from our sorrow? Let us mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and\nmind, but let those of us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight our foes more fiercely. In that hour\nlet no man hold back, waiting for a second summons; such summons shall bode ill for him who is found lagging\nbehind at our ships; let us rather sally as one man and loose the fury of war upon the Trojans.\u201d\nWhen he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with Meges son of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones,\nLycomedes son of Creontes, and Melanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The word was not\nsooner said than the deed was done: they brought out the seven tripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the\ntwenty metal cauldrons and the twelve horses; they also brought the women skilled in useful arts, seven in number,\nwith Briseis, which made eight. Ulysses weighed out the ten talents of gold and then led the way back, while the\n205 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nyoung Achaeans brought the rest of the gifts, and laid them in the middle of the assembly.\nAgamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of a god came to him with the boar. The son\nof Atreus drew the knife which he wore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting off some bris-\ntles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as he did so. The other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and\norderly to hear the king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and prayed saying, \u201cI call Jove the first\nand mightiest of all gods to witness, I call also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes who dwell below and take vengeance\non him who shall swear falsely, that I have laid no hand upon the girl Briseis, neither to take her to my bed nor oth-\nerwise, but that she has remained in my tents inviolate. If I swear falsely may heaven visit me with all the penalties\nwhich it metes out to those who perjure themselves.\u201d\nHe cut the boar\u2019s throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled it round his head, and flung it into the wide\nsea to feed the fishes. Then Achilles also rose and said to the Argives, \u201cFather Jove, of a truth you blind men\u2019s eyes\nand bane them. The son of Atreus had not else stirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken Briseis from\nme against my will. Surely Jove must have counselled the destruction of many an Argive. Go, now, and take your\nfood that we may begin fighting.\u201d\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own ship. The Myrmidons attended to the\npresents and took them away to the ship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the stable-men drove the\nhorses in among the others.\nBriseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of Patroclus, flung herself upon it and cried aloud, tear-\ning her breast, her neck, and her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful as a goddess she wept and said, \u201cPatro-\nclus, dearest friend, when I went hence I left you living; I return, O prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows\nmultiply upon me one after the other. I saw him to whom my father and mother married me, cut down before our\ncity, and my three own dear brothers perished with him on the self-same day; but you, Patroclus, even when Achil-\nles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes, told me that I was not to weep, for you said you would\nmake Achilles marry me, and take me back with him to Phthia, we should have a wedding feast among the Myrmi-\ndons. You were always kind to me and I shall never cease to grieve for you.\u201d\nShe wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making as though their tears were for Patroclus,\nbut in truth each was weeping for her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round Achilles and prayed\nhim to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. \u201cI pray you,\u201d said he, \u201cif any comrade will hear me, bid me\nneither eat nor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even to the going down of the sun.\u201d\nOn this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of Atreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and\nthe knight Phoenix, who stayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow: but he would not\nbe comforted till he should have flung himself into the jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever of\nPatroclus. Then he said\u2014\n\u201cHapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner ready for me at once and without delay\nwhen the Achaeans were hasting to fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and drink in my tents,\nyet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this I could not know, not even though I were to hear of the death of\nmy father, who is now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who am here fighting the Trojans in a strange\nland for the accursed sake of Helen, nor yet though I should hear that my son is no more\u2014he who is being brought\nup in Scyros\u2014if indeed Neoptolemus is still living. Till now I made sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy away\nfrom Argos, while you were to return to Phthia, bring back my son with you in your own ship, and show him all my\nproperty, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house\u2014for Peleus must surely be either dead, or what little life\nremains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities of age and ever present fear lest he should hear the sad tidings\nof my death.\u201d\nHe wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thought on what he had left at home behind him.\nThe son of Saturn looked down with pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, \u201cMy child, you have quite de-\nserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out of your recollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss\nof his dear comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner he will neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop\nnectar and ambrosia into his breast, that he may know no hunger.\u201d\nWith these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind. She darted down from heaven into the\nair like some falcon sailing on his broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming throughout\nthe host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and ambrosia into Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause\nhis limbs to fail him, she went back to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the chill snow-flakes shed from the\nhand of Jove and borne on the keen blasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming helmets, the bossed\nshields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the ashen spears stream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the\nwhole land was radiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of the tramp of their treading rose from under\ntheir feet. In the midst of them all Achilles put on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire, for\nhis grief was greater than he could bear. Thus, then, full of fury against the Trojans, did he don the gift of the god,\n206 The Iliad\nthe armour that Vulcan had made him.\nFirst he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and next he did on the breastplate about his chest.\nHe slung the silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield so great and strong\nthat shone afar with a splendour as of the moon. As the light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men have lit a\nfire in their homestead high up among the mountains, but the sailors are carried out to sea by wind and storm far\nfrom the haven where they would be\u2014even so did the gleam of Achilles\u2019 wondrous shield strike up into the heav-\nens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet, and set it upon his head, from whence it shone like a star, and the golden\nplumes which Vulcan had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved all around it. Then Achilles made trial of\nhimself in his armour to see whether it fitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and it seemed to buoy\nhim up as though it had been wings.\nHe also drew his father\u2019s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so great and heavy and strong that none of the\nAchaeans save only Achilles had strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash from the topmost ridges of Mt.\nPelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus, fraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus busied\nthemselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast about them, and put the bit in their mouths,\ndrawing the reins back towards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up behind the horses, and after him\nAchilles mounted in full armour, resplendent as the sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he chided with his\nfather\u2019s horses saying, \u201cXanthus and Balius, famed offspring of Podarge\u2014this time when we have done fighting be\nsure and bring your driver safely back to the host of the Achaeans, and do not leave him dead on the plain as you\ndid Patroclus.\u201d\nThen fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke \u2014 for white-armed Juno had endowed him with human speech\u2014\nand he bowed his head till his mane touched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. \u201cDread Achil-\nles,\u201d said he, \u201cwe will indeed save you now, but the day of your death is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it\nwill be heaven and stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth or slackness on our part that the\nTrojans stripped Patroclus of his armour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him as he fought\namong the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to Hector. We two can fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is\nfleetest of all winds; nevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a man and of a god.\u201d\nWhen he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles answered him in great sadness, saying,\n\u201cWhy, O Xanthus, do you thus foretell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to fall here, far from\nmy dear father and mother; none the more, however, shall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of\nfighting.\u201d\nSo saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.\nBook XX\nTHUS, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son of Peleus, who were hungering for battle;\nwhile the Trojans over against them armed upon the rise of the plain.\nMeanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis gather the gods in council, whereon she\nwent about and called them to the house of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nor a single one of\nthe nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs of rivers and meadows of green grass. When they reached the house\nof cloud-compelling Jove, they took their seats in the arcades of polished marble which Vulcan with his consum-\nmate skill had made for father Jove.\nIn such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove. Neptune also, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the\ncall of the goddess, and came up out of the sea to join them. There, sitting in the midst of them, he asked what Jove\u2019s\npurpose might be. \u201cWhy,\u201d said he, \u201cwielder of the lightning, have you called the gods in council? Are you consid-\nering some matter that concerns the Trojans and Achaeans\u2014for the blaze of battle is on the point of being kindled\nbetween them?\u201d\nAnd Jove answered, \u201cYou know my purpose, shaker of earth, and wherefore I have called you hither. I take\nthought for them even in their destruction. For my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt. Olympus and look on\nin peace, but do you others go about among Trojans and Achaeans, and help either side as you may be severally\ndisposed. If Achilles fights the Trojans without hindrance they will make no stand against him; they have ever trem-\nbled at the sight of him, and now that he is roused to such fury about his comrade, he will override fate itself and\nstorm their city.\u201d\nThus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took their several sides and went into battle.\nJuno, Pallas Minerva, earth-encircling Neptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellent in all cunning\u2014all\nthese joined the host that came from the ships; with them also came Vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with\nhis thin legs plying lustily under him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined the Trojans, and with him Apollo of locks\nunshorn, and the archer goddess Diana, Leto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus.\n207 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSo long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors the Achaeans were triumphant, for Achilles\nwho had long refused to fight was now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him for fear as he\nbeheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in his armour, and looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olym-\npians came to take their part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife, rouser of hosts, and Minerva raised her\nloud voice, now standing by the deep trench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with all her might upon\nthe shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed out upon the other side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and\ncalled on the Trojans at the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and now speeding up the side of the river\nSimois till he came to the hill Callicolone.\nThus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fierce contention also among themselves. The sire of\ngods and men thundered from heaven above, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth, and bade the high\nhills tremble. The spurs and crests of many-fountained Ida quaked, as also the city of the Trojans and the ships of\nthe Achaeans. Hades, king of the realms below, was struck with fear; he sprang panic-stricken from his throne and\ncried aloud in terror lest Neptune, lord of the earthquake, should crack the ground over his head, and lay bare his\nmouldy mansions to the sight of mortals and immortals\u2014mansions so ghastly grim that even the gods shudder\nto think of them. Such was the uproar as the gods came together in battle. Apollo with his arrows took his stand\nto face King Neptune, while Minerva took hers against the god of war; the archer-goddess Diana with her golden\narrows, sister of far-darting Apollo, stood to face Juno; Mercury the lusty bringer of good luck faced Leto, while the\nmighty eddying river whom men can Scamander, but gods Xanthus, matched himself against Vulcan.\nThe gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the heart of Achilles was set on meeting Hector son\nof Priam, for it was with his blood that he longed above all things else to glut the stubborn lord of battle. Meanwhile\nApollo set Aeneas on to attack the son of Peleus, and put courage into his heart, speaking with the voice of Lycaon\nson of Priam. In his likeness therefore, he said to Aeneas, \u201cAeneas, counsellor of the Trojans, where are now the\nbrave words with which you vaunted over your wine before the Trojan princes, saying that you would fight Achilles\nson of Peleus in single combat?\u201d\nAnd Aeneas answered, \u201cWhy do you thus bid me fight the proud son of Peleus, when I am in no mind to do so?\nWere I to face him now, it would not be for the first time. His spear has already put me to Right from Ida, when he\nattacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus and Pedasus; Jove indeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength to\nfly, else had the fallen by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, who went before him to protect him and urged him to\nfall upon the Lelegae and Trojans. No man may fight Achilles, for one of the gods is always with him as his guardian\nangel, and even were it not so, his weapon flies ever straight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of him who is against\nhim; if heaven would let me fight him on even terms he should not soon overcome me, though he boasts that he is\nmade of bronze.\u201d\nThen said King Apollo, son to Jove, \u201cNay, hero, pray to the ever-living gods, for men say that you were born of\nJove\u2019s daughter Venus, whereas Achilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus is child to Jove, while Thetis is\nbut daughter to the old man of the sea. Bring, therefore, your spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare you\nwith his taunts and menaces.\u201d\nAs he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his people, and he strode in full armour among the\nranks of the foremost fighters. Nor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed Juno, as he went forth\ninto the throng to meet Achilles. She called the gods about her, and said, \u201cLook to it, you two, Neptune and Miner-\nva, and consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas clad in full armour to fight Achilles.\nShall we turn him back at once, or shall one of us stand by Achilles and endow him with strength so that his heart\nfail not, and he may learn that the chiefs of the immortals are on his side, while the others who have all along been\ndefending the Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all come down from Olympus and join in the fight, that this day\nhe may take no hurt at the hands of the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whatever fate may have spun out for him\nwhen he was begotten and his mother bore him. If Achilles be not thus assured by the voice of a god, he may come\nto fear presently when one of us meets him in battle, for the gods are terrible if they are seen face to face.\u201d\nNeptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, \u201cJuno, restrain your fury; it is not well; I am not in favour\nof forcing the other gods to fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on our own side; let us take our places on some\nhill out of the beaten track, and let mortals fight it out among themselves. If Mars or Phoebus Apollo begin fighting,\nor keep Achilles in check so that he cannot fight, we too, will at once raise the cry of battle, and in that case they will\nsoon leave the field and go back vanquished to Olympus among the other gods.\u201d\nWith these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high earth-barrow of Hercules, built round solid\nmasonry, and made by the Trojans and Pallas Minerva for him fly to when the sea-monster was chasing him from\nthe shore on to the plain. Here Neptune and those that were with him took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud\nof darkness; but the other gods seated themselves on the brow of Callicolone round you, O Phoebus, and Mars the\nwaster of cities.\nThus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side was willing to begin battle with the other, and\n208 The Iliad\nJove from his seat on high was in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain was alive with men and hors-\nes, and blazing with the gleam of armour. The earth rang again under the tramp of their feet as they rushed towards\neach other, and two champions, by far the foremost of them all, met between the hosts to fight\u2014to wit, Aeneas son\nof Anchises, and noble Achilles.\nAeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet tossing defiance as he came on. He held his\nstrong shield before his breast, and brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from the other side sprang forth\nto meet him, fike some fierce lion that the whole country-side has met to hunt and kill\u2014at first he bodes no ill, but\nwhen some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouches openmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars with fury,\nhe lashes his tail from side to side about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springs straight before him, to find out\nwhether he is to slay, or be slain among the foremost of his foes\u2014even with such fury did Achilles burn to spring\nupon Aeneas.\nWhen they were now close up with one another Achilles was first to speak. \u201cAeneas,\u201d said he, \u201cwhy do you stand\nthus out before the host to fight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the seat of Priam? Nay, though\nyou kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom over to you. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his\nown. Or have the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness, fair with orchard lawns and corn lands,\nif you should slay me? This you shall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have you forgotten how when\nyou were alone I chased you from your herds helter-skelter down the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to look\nbehind you; you took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked the city, and with the help of Minerva and father Jove I\nsacked it and carried its women into captivity, though Jove and the other gods rescued you. You think they will\nprotect you now, but they will not do so; therefore I say go back into the host, and do not face me, or you will rue it.\nEven a fool may be wise after the event.\u201d\nThen Aeneas answered, \u201cSon of Peleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were a child. I too, if\nI will, can brag and talk unseemly. We know one another\u2019s race and parentage as matters of common fame, though\nneither have you ever seen my parents nor I yours. Men say that you are son to noble Peleus, and that your mother\nis Thetis, fair-haired daughter of the sea. I have noble Anchises for my father, and Venus for my mother; the parents\nof one or other of us shall this day mourn a son, for it will be more than silly talk that shall part us when the fight is\nover. Learn, then, my lineage if you will\u2014and it is known to many.\n\u201cIn the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and founded Dardania, for Ilius was not yet stablished on the\nplain for men to dwell in, and her people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained Ida. Dardanus had a son,\nking Erichthonius, who was wealthiest of all men living; he had three thousand mares that fed by the water-mead-\nows, they and their foals with them. Boreas was enamoured of them as they were feeding, and covered them in the\nsemblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve filly foals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped over\nthe rich plain, would go bounding on over the ripe ears of corn and not break them; or again when they would\ndisport themselves on the broad back of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonius begat Tros,\nking of the Trojans, and Tros had three noble sons, Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal\nmen; wherefore the gods carried him off to be Jove\u2019s cupbearer, for his beauty\u2019s sake, that he might dwell among\nthe immortals. Ilus begat Laomedon, and Laomedon begat Tithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the\nstock of Mars. But Assaracus was father to Capys, and Capys to Anchises, who was my father, while Hector is son to\nPriam.\n\u201cSuch do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jove gives it or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all.\nAnd now let there be no more of this prating in mid-battle as though we were children. We could fling taunts with-\nout end at one another; a hundred-oared galley would not hold them. The tongue can run all whithers and talk all\nwise; it can go here and there, and as a man says, so shall he be gainsaid. What is the use of our bandying hard like\nwomen who when they fall foul of one another go out and wrangle in the streets, one half true and the other lies, as\nrage inspires them? No words of yours shall turn me now that I am fain to fight\u2014therefore let us make trial of one\nanother with our spears.\u201d\nAs he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield of Achilles, which rang out as the point struck it.\nThe son of Peleus held the shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid, for he deemed that Aeneas\u2019s\nspear would go through it quite easily, not reflecting that the god\u2019s glorious gifts were little likely to yield before\nthe blows of mortal men; and indeed Aeneas\u2019s spear did not pierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god,\nstayed the point. It went through two layers, but the god had made the shield in five, two of bronze, the two inner-\nmost ones of tin, and one of gold; it was in this that the spear was stayed.\nAchilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas at the very edge, where the bronze was\nthinnest; the spear of Pelian ash went clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas was afraid, and\ncrouched backwards, holding the shield away from him; the spear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering\nin the ground, after having gone through both circles of the sheltering shield. Aeneas though he had avoided the\nspear, stood still, blinded with fear and grief because the weapon had gone so near him; then Achilles sprang furi-\n209 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nously upon him, with a cry as of death and with his keen blade drawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that\ntwo men, as men now are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneas wielded it quite easily.\nAeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towards him, either on the helmet, or on the shield\nthat covered him, and Achilles would have closed with him and despatched him with his sword, had not Neptune\nlord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said forthwith to the immortals, \u201cAlas, I am sorry for great Aeneas,\nwho will now go down to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son of Peleus. Fool that he was to give ear to the\ncounsel of Apollo. Apollo will never save him from destruction. Why should this man suffer when he is guiltless,\nto no purpose, and in another\u2019s quarrel? Has he not at all times offered acceptable sacrifice to the gods that dwell in\nheaven? Let us then snatch him from death\u2019s jaws, lest the son of Saturn be angry should Achilles slay him. It is fat-\ned, moreover, that he should escape, and that the race of Dardanus, whom Jove loved above all the sons born to him\nof mortal women, shall not perish utterly without seed or sign. For now indeed has Jove hated the blood of Priam,\nwhile Aeneas shall reign over the Trojans, he and his children\u2019s children that shall be born hereafter.\u201d\nThen answered Juno, \u201cEarth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, and consider concerning Aeneas, whether you\nwill save him, or suffer him, brave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son of Peleus. For of a truth we two, I\nand Pallas Minerva, have sworn full many a time before all the immortals, that never would we shield Trojans from\ndestruction, not even when all Troy is burning in the flames that the Achaeans shall kindle.\u201d\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battle amid the clash of spears, and came to the\nplace where Achilles and Aeneas were. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son of Peleus, drew the\nbronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of Aeneas, and laid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneas on\nhigh from off the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of many a band of warriors both horse and foot did\nhe soar as the god\u2019s hand sped him, till he came to the very fringe of the battle where the Cauconians were arming\nthemselves for fight. Neptune, shaker of the earth, then came near to him and said, Aeneas, what god has egged you\non to this folly in fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a mightier man of valour and more beloved of heaven than\nyou are? Give way before him whensoever you meet him, lest you go down to the house of Hades even though fate\nwould have it otherwise. When Achilles is dead you may then fight among the foremost undaunted, for none other\nof the Achaeans shall slay you.\u201d\nThe god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at once removed the darkness from before the\neyes of Achilles, who opened them wide indeed and said in great anger, \u201cAlas! what marvel am I now beholding?\nHere is my spear upon the ground, but I see not him whom I meant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also\nmust be under heaven\u2019s protection, although I had thought his boasting was idle. Let him go hang; he will be in no\nmood to fight me further, seeing how narrowly he has missed being killed. I will now give my orders to the Danaans\nand attack some other of the Trojans.\u201d\nHe sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did so. \u201cLet not the Trojans,\u201d he cried, \u201ckeep you\nat arm\u2019s length, Achaeans, but go for them and fight them man for man. However valiant I may be, I cannot give\nchase to so many and fight all of them. Even Mars, who is an immortal, or Minerva, would shrink from flinging\nhimself into the jaws of such a fight and laying about him; nevertheless, so far as in me lies I will show no slackness\nof hand or foot nor want of endurance, not even for a moment; I will utterly break their ranks, and woe to the Tro-\njan who shall venture within reach of my spear.\u201d\nThus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans and declared that he would fight Achilles.\n\u201cBe not afraid, proud Trojans,\u201d said he, \u201cto face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods myself if the battle were one of\nwords only, but they would be more than a match for me, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deed of Achilles\nwill fall somewhat short of his word; he will do in part, and the other part he will clip short. I will go up against him\nthough his hands be as fire\u2014though his hands be fire and his strength iron.\u201d\nThus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the Achaeans, and raised the cry of battle as they flung\nthemselves into the midst of their ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector and said, \u201cHector, on no account\nmust you challenge Achilles to single combat; keep a lookout for him while you are under cover of the others and\naway from the thick of the fight, otherwise he will either hit you with a spear or cut you down at close quarters.\u201d\nThus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he was afraid when he heard what the god had said\nto him. Achilles then sprang upon the Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as with a garment. First he killed\nIphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of much people whom a naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities,\nin the land of Hyde under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achilles struck him full on the head as he was coming\non towards him, and split it clean in two; whereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achilles vaunted over him say-\ning, \u201cYou he low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero; your death is here, but your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where\nyour father\u2019s estate lies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying waters of Hermus.\u201d\nThus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The chariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their\nwheels passed over him in the front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, a valiant man of war\nand son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple through his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay\n210 The Iliad\nthe spear, but it went right on, crushing the bone so that the brain inside was shed in all directions, and his lust of\nfighting was ended. Then he struck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down from his chariot in front\nof him, and trying to escape. He breathed his last, bellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him\nto offer him in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and the heart of the earth-shaker is glad; even so did he bellow as he\nlay dying. Achilles then went in pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom his father had always forbidden to fight\nbecause he was the youngest of his sons, the one he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in his folly and showing\noff the fleetness of his feet, was rushing about among front ranks until he lost his life, for Achilles struck him in the\nmiddle of the back as he was darting past him: he struck him just at the golden fastenings of his belt and where the\ntwo pieces of the double breastplate overlapped. The point of the spear pierced him through and came out by the\nnavel, whereon he fell groaning on to his knees and a cloud of darkness overshadowed him as he sank holding his\nentrails in his hands.\nWhen Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his hands and sinking down upon the ground, a\nmist came over his eyes, and he could not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised his spear and darted\ntowards Achilles like a flame of fire. When Achilles saw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, \u201cThis is he\nthat has wounded my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved comrade. Not for long shall we two quail before\none another on the highways of war.\u201d\nHe looked fiercely on Hector and said, \u201cDraw near, that you may meet your doom the sooner.\u201d Hector feared\nhim not and answered, \u201cSon of Peleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were a child; I too if I\nwill can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you are a mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue\nlies in the the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may not slay you with my spear, for this too has been\nfound keen ere now.\u201d\nHe hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, and though she breathed but very lightly she\nturned it back from going towards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet in front of him. Achilles\nthen sprang furiously on him with a loud cry, bent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god can,\nand hid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards him spear in hand, and thrice did he waste his\nblow upon the air. When he rushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god, he shouted aloud saying,\n\u201cHound, this time too you have escaped death \u2014 but of a truth it came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to\nwhom it seems you pray before you go into battle, has again saved you; but if I too have any friend among the gods\nI will surely make an end of you when I come across you at some other time. Now, however, I will pursue and over-\ntake other Trojans.\u201d\nOn this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his neck, and he fell headlong at his feet. There he\nlet him lie and stayed Demouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great stature, by hitting him on the knee\nwith a spear; then he smote him with his sword and killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonus and Dardanus,\nsons of Bias, and threw them from their chariot, the one with a blow from a thrown spear, while the other he cut\ndown in hand-to-hand fight. There was also Tros the son of Alastor\u2014he came up to Achilles and clasped his knees\nin the hope that he would spare him and not kill him but let him go, because they were both of the same age. Fool,\nhe might have known that he should not prevail with him, for the man was in no mood for pity or forbearance but\nwas in grim earnest. Therefore when Tros laid hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers, Achilles drove\nhis sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling out, while his bosom was all covered with the black blood that\nwelled from the wound. Thus did death close his eyes as he lay lifeless.\nAchilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with a spear, and the bronze spear-head came\nright out at the other ear. He also struck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, which became warm\nwith the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes of Echeclus. Next in order the bronze point of his spear\nwounded Deucalion in the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united, whereon he waited Achilles\u2019 onset\nwith his arm hanging down and death staring him in the face. Achilles cut his head off with a blow from his sword\nand flung it helmet and all away from him, and the marrow came oozing out of his backbone as he lay. He then\nwent in pursuit of Rhigmus, noble son of Peires, who had come from fertile Thrace, and struck him through the\nmiddle with a spear which fixed itself in his belly, so that he fell headlong from his chariot. He also speared Areit-\nhous squire to Rhigmus in the back as he was turning his horses in flight, and thrust him from his chariot, while the\nhorses were struck with panic.\nAs a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought\u2014and the dense forest is in a blaze, while the wind\ncarries great tongues of fire in every direction\u2014even so furiously did Achilles rage, wielding his spear as though he\nwere a god, and giving chase to those whom he would slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokes\nbroad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor\u2014and it is soon bruised small under the feet of\nthe lowing cattle\u2014even so did the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies of the slain. The axle under-\nneath and the railing that ran round the car were bespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses\u2019 hoofs,\nand from the tyres of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed on to win still further glory, and his hands were\n211 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nbedrabbled with gore.\nBook XXI\nNOW when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Achilles cut\ntheir forces in two: one half he chased over the plain towards the city by the same way that the Achaeans had taken\nwhen flying panic-stricken on the preceding day with Hector in full triumph; this way did they fly pell-mell, and\nJuno sent down a thick mist in front of them to stay them. The other half were hemmed in by the deep silver-eddy-\ning stream, and fell into it with a great uproar. The waters resounded, and the banks rang again, as they swam hither\nand thither with loud cries amid the whirling eddies. As locusts flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire\u2014the\nflame comes on and on till at last it overtakes them and they huddle into the water\u2014even so was the eddying stream\nof Xanthus filled with the uproar of men and horses, all struggling in confusion before Achilles.\nForthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it against a tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river\nlike a god, armed with his sword only. Fell was his purpose as he hewed the Trojans down on every side. Their dy-\ning groans rose hideous as the sword smote them, and the river ran red with blood. As when fish fly scared before\na huge dolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some fair haven\u2014for he is sure to eat all he can catch\u2014even so\ndid the Trojans cower under the banks of the mighty river, and when Achilles\u2019 arms grew weary with killing them,\nhe drew twelve youths alive out of the water, to sacrifice in revenge for Patroclus son of Menoetius. He drew them\nout like dazed fawns, bound their hands behind them with the girdles of their own shirts, and gave them over to his\nmen to take back to the ships. Then he sprang into the river, thirsting for still further blood.\nThere he found Lycaon, son of Priam seed of Dardanus, as he was escaping out of the water; he it was whom\nhe had once taken prisoner when he was in his father\u2019s vineyard, having set upon him by night, as he was cutting\nyoung shoots from a wild fig-tree to make the wicker sides of a chariot. Achilles then caught him to his sorrow\nunawares, and sent him by sea to Lemnos, where the son of Jason bought him. But a guest-friend, Eetion of Imbros,\nfreed him with a great sum, and sent him to Arisbe, whence he had escaped and returned to his father\u2019s house. He\nhad spent eleven days happily with his friends after he had come from Lemnos, but on the twelfth heaven again\ndelivered him into the hands of Achilles, who was to send him to the house of Hades sorely against his will. He was\nunarmed when Achilles caught sight of him, and had neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had he any spear, for he had\nthrown all his armour from him on to the bank, and was sweating with his struggles to get out of the river, so that\nhis strength was now failing him.\nThen Achilles said to himself in his surprise, \u201cWhat marvel do I see here? If this man can come back alive after\nhaving been sold over into Lemnos, I shall have the Trojans also whom I have slain rising from the world below.\nCould not even the waters of the grey sea imprison him, as they do many another whether he will or no? This time\nlet him taste my spear, that I may know for certain whether mother earth who can keep even a strong man down,\nwill be able to hold him, or whether thence too he will return.\u201d\nThus did he pause and ponder. But Lycaon came up to him dazed and trying hard to embrace his knees, for he\nwould fain live, not die. Achilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lycaon ran crouching up\nto him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passed over his back, and stuck in the ground, hungering though\nit was for blood. With one hand he caught Achilles\u2019 knees as he besought him, and with the other he clutched the\nspear and would not let it go. Then he said, \u201cAchilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for I am your suppliant.\nIt was in your tents that I first broke bread on the day when you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you\nsold away to Lemnos far from my father and my friends, and I brought you the price of a hundred oxen. I have paid\nthree times as much to gain my freedom; it is but twelve days that I have come to Ilius after much suffering, and\nnow cruel fate has again thrown me into your hands. Surely father Jove must hate me, that he has given me over\nto you a second time. Short of life indeed did my mother Laothoe bear me, daughter of aged Altes\u2014of Altes who\nreigns over the warlike Lelegae and holds steep Pedasus on the river Satnioeis. Priam married his daughter along\nwith many other women and two sons were born of her, both of whom you will have slain. Your spear slew noble\nPolydorus as he was fighting in the front ranks, and now evil will here befall me, for I fear that I shall not escape you\nsince heaven has delivered me over to you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, spare me, for I am\nnot of the same womb as Hector who slew your brave and noble comrade.\u201d\nWith such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles; but Achilles answered him sternly. \u201cIdiot,\u201d said\nhe, \u201ctalk not to me of ransom. Until Patroclus fell I preferred to give the Trojans quarter, and sold beyond the sea\nmany of those whom I had taken alive; but now not a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my hands\nbefore the city of Ilius\u2014and of all Trojans it shall fare hardest with the sons of Priam. Therefore, my friend, you\ntoo shall die. Why should you whine in this way? Patroclus fell, and he was a better man than you are. I too\u2014see\nyou not how I am great and goodly? I am son to a noble father, and have a goddess for my mother, but the hands of\ndoom and death overshadow me all as surely. The day will come, either at dawn or dark, or at the noontide, when\n212 The Iliad\none shall take my life also in battle, either with his spear, or with an arrow sped from his bow.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and Lycaon\u2019s heart sank within him. He loosed his hold of the spear, and held out both\nhands before him; but Achilles drew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his neck; he plunged his\ntwo-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon he lay at full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling\nfrom him till the earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot and flung him into the river to go down\nstream, vaunting over him the while, and saying, \u201cLie there among the fishes, who will lick the blood from your\nwound and gloat over it; your mother shall not lay you on any bier to mourn you, but the eddies of Scamander shall\nbear you into the broad bosom of the sea. There shall the fishes feed on the fat of Lycaon as they dart under the\ndark ripple of the waters\u2014so perish all of you till we reach the citadel of strong Ilius\u2014you in flight, and I following\nafter to destroy you. The river with its broad silver stream shall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls you offered\nhim and all the horses that you flung living into his waters. None the less miserably shall you perish till there is not\na man of you but has paid in full for the death of Patroclus and the havoc you wrought among the Achaeans whom\nyou have slain while I held aloof from battle.\u201d\nSo spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and pondered within himself how he should stay\nthe hand of Achilles and save the Trojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus, spear in hand, sprang upon\nAsteropaeus son of Pelegon to kill him. He was son to the broad river Axius and Periboea eldest daughter of Aces-\nsamenus; for the river had lain with her. Asteropaeus stood up out of the water to face him with a spear in either\nhand, and Xanthus filled him with courage, being angry for the death of the youths whom Achilles was slaying\nruthlessly within his waters. When they were close up with one another Achilles was first to speak. \u201cWho and\nwhence are you,\u201d said he, \u201cwho dare to face me? Woe to the parents whose son stands up against me.\u201d And the son\nof Pelegon answered, \u201cGreat son of Peleus, why should you ask my lineage. I am from the fertile land of far Paeonia,\ncaptain of the Paeonians, and it is now eleven days that I am at Ilius. I am of the blood of the river Axius\u2014of Axius\nthat is the fairest of all rivers that run. He begot the famed warrior Pelegon, whose son men call me. Let us now\nfight, Achilles.\u201d\nThus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian ash. Asteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he\ncould use both hands alike; with the one spear he struck Achilles\u2019 shield, but did not pierce it, for the layer of gold,\ngift of the god, stayed the point; with the other spear he grazed the elbow of Achilles! right arm drawing dark blood,\nbut the spear itself went by him and fixed itself in the ground, foiled of its bloody banquet. Then Achilles, fain to kill\nhim, hurled his spear at Asteropaeus, but failed to hit him and struck the steep bank of the river, driving the spear\nhalf its length into the earth. The son of Peleus then drew his sword and sprang furiously upon him. Asteropaeus\nvainly tried to draw Achilles\u2019 spear out of the bank by main force; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his might to\ndraw it out, and thrice he had to leave off trying; the fourth time he tried to bend and break it, but ere he could do\nso Achilles smote him with his sword and killed him. He struck him in the belly near the navel, so that all his bow-\nels came gushing out on to the ground, and the darkness of death came over him as he lay gasping. Then Achilles\nset his foot on his chest and spoiled him of his armour, vaunting over him and saying, \u201cLie there\u2014begotten of a riv-\ner though you be, it is hard for you to strive with the offspring of Saturn\u2019s son. You declare yourself sprung from the\nblood of a broad river, but I am of the seed of mighty Jove. My father is Peleus, son of Aeacus ruler over the many\nMyrmidons, and Aeacus was the son of Jove. Therefore as Jove is mightier than any river that flows into the sea, so\nare his children stronger than those of any river whatsoever. Moreover you have a great river hard by if he can be\nof any use to you, but there is no fighting against Jove the son of Saturn, with whom not even King Achelous can\ncompare, nor the mighty stream of deep-flowing Oceanus, from whom all rivers and seas with all springs and deep\nwells proceed; even Oceanus fears the lightnings of great Jove, and his thunder that comes crashing out of heaven.\u201d\nWith this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that he had killed Asteropaeus, he let him lie\nwhere he was on the sand, with the dark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busy nibbling and gnaw-\ning the fat that was about his kidneys. Then he went in chase of the Paeonians, who were flying along the bank of\nthe river in panic when they saw their leader slain by the hands of the son of Peleus. Therein he slew Thersilochus,\nMydon, Astypylus, Mnesus, Thrasius, Oeneus, and Ophelestes, and he would have slain yet others, had not the\nriver in anger taken human form, and spoken to him from out the deep waters saying, \u201cAchilles, if you excel all in\nstrength, so do you also in wickedness, for the gods are ever with you to protect you: if, then, the son of Saturn has\nvouchsafed it to you to destroy all the Trojans, at any rate drive them out of my stream, and do your grim work on\nland. My fair waters are now filled with corpses, nor can I find any channel by which I may pour myself into the sea\nfor I am choked with dead, and yet you go on mercilessly slaying. I am in despair, therefore, O captain of your host,\ntrouble me no further.\u201d\nAchilles answered, \u201cSo be it, Scamander, Jove-descended; but I will never cease dealing out death among the\nTrojans, till I have pent them up in their city, and made trial of Hector face to face, that I may learn whether he is to\nvanquish me, or I him.\u201d\nAs he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of the gods. But the river said to Apollo, \u201cSurely, son\n213 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nof Jove, lord of the silver bow, you are not obeying the commands of Jove who charged you straitly that you should\nstand by the Trojans and defend them, till twilight fades, and darkness is over an the earth.\u201d\nMeanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon the river raised a high wave and attacked\nhim. He swelled his stream into a torrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles had slain and left with-\nin his waters. These he cast out on to the land, bellowing like a bull the while, but the living he saved alive, hiding\nthem in his mighty eddies. The great and terrible wave gathered about Achilles, falling upon him and beating on his\nshield, so that he could not keep his feet; he caught hold of a great elm-tree, but it came up by the roots, and tore\naway the bank, damming the stream with its thick branches and bridging it all across; whereby Achilles struggled\nout of the stream, and fled full speed over the plain, for he was afraid.\nBut the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him with a dark-crested wave, to stay his\nhands and save the Trojans from destruction. The son of Peleus darted away a spear\u2019s throw from him; swift as the\nswoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongest and fleetest of all birds, even so did he spring forward, and the\narmour rang loudly about his breast. He fled on in front, but the river with a loud roar came tearing after. As one\nwho would water his garden leads a stream from some fountain over his plants, and all his ground-spade in hand\nhe clears away the dams to free the channels, and the little stones run rolling round and round with the water as it\ngoes merrily down the bank faster than the man can follow\u2014even so did the river keep catching up with Achilles\nalbeit he was a fleet runner, for the gods are stronger than men. As often as he would strive to stand his ground, and\nsee whether or no all the gods in heaven were in league against him, so often would the mighty wave come beating\ndown upon his shoulders, and be would have to keep flying on and on in great dismay; for the angry flood was\ntiring him out as it flowed past him and ate the ground from under his feet.\nThen the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, \u201cFather Jove, is there none of the gods who will take\npity upon me, and save me from the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards. I blame none of the\nother dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do my dear mother, who has beguiled and tricked me. She told me I was\nto fall under the walls of Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; would that Hector, the best man among the Trojans,\nmight there slay me; then should I fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seems that I shall come to a\nmost pitiable end, trapped in this river as though I were some swineherd\u2019s boy, who gets carried down a torrent\nwhile trying to cross it during a storm.\u201d\nAs soon as he had spoken thus, Neptune and Minerva came up to him in the likeness of two men, and took him\nby the hand to reassure him. Neptune spoke first. \u201cSon of Peleus,\u201d said he, \u201cbe not so exceeding fearful; we are two\ngods, come with Jove\u2019s sanction to assist you, I, and Pallas Minerva. It is not your fate to perish in this river; he will\nabate presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise you, if you will be guided by us, not to stay your hand\nfrom fighting till you have pent the Trojan host within the famed walls of Ilius\u2014as many of them as may escape.\nThen kill Hector and go back to the ships, for we will vouchsafe you a triumph over him.\u201d\nWhen they had so said they went back to the other immortals, but Achilles strove onward over the plain, en-\ncouraged by the charge the gods had laid upon him. All was now covered with the flood of waters, and much good-\nly armour of the youths that had been slain was rifting about, as also many corpses, but he forced his way against\nthe stream, speeding right onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him, for Minerva had endowed him with great\nstrength. Nevertheless Scamander did not slacken in his pursuit, but was still more furious with the son of Peleus.\nHe lifted his waters into a high crest and cried aloud to Simois saying, \u201cDear brother, let the two of us unite to save\nthis man, or he will sack the mighty city of King Priam, and the Trojans will not hold out against him. Help me at\nonce; fill your streams with water from their sources, rouse all your torrents to a fury; raise your wave on high, and\nlet snags and stones come thundering down you that we may make an end of this savage creature who is now lord-\ning it as though he were a god. Nothing shall serve him longer, not strength nor comeliness, nor his fine armour,\nwhich forsooth shall soon be lying low in the deep waters covered over with mud. I will wrap him in sand, and pour\ntons of shingle round him, so that the Achaeans shall not know how to gather his bones for the silt in which I shall\nhave hidden him, and when they celebrate his funeral they need build no barrow.\u201d\nOn this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles, seething as it was with foam and blood and the\nbo&ies of the dead. The dark waters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmed the son of Peleus, but\nJuno, trembling lest Achilles should be swept away in the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out to\nVulcan her son. \u201cCrook-foot,\u201d she cried, \u201cmy child, be up and doing, for I deem it is with you that Xanthus is fain to\nfight; help us at once, kindle a fierce fire; I will then bring up the west and the white south wind in a mighty hurri-\ncane from the sea, that shall bear the flames against the heads and armour of the Trojans and consume them, while\nyou go along the banks of Xanthus burning his trees and wrapping him round with fire. Let him not turn you back\nneither by fair words nor foul, and slacken not till I shout and tell you. Then you may stay your flames.\u201d\nOn this Vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon the plain and burned the many dead whom\nAchilles had killed and whose bodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the plain was dried and\nthe flood stayed. As the north wind, blowing on an orchard that has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it,\n214 The Iliad\nand the heart of the owner is glad\u2014even so the whole plan was dried and the dead bodies were consumed. Then\nhe turned tongues of fire on to the river. He burned the elms the willows and the tamarisks, the lotus also, with the\nrushes and marshy herbage that grew abundantly by the banks of the river. The eels and fishes that go darting about\neverywhere in the water, these, too, were sorely harassed by the flames that cunning Vulcan had kindled, and the\nriver himself was scalded, so that he spoke saying, \u201cVulcan, there is no god can hold his own against you. I cannot\nfight you when you flare out your flames in this way; strive with me no longer. Let Achilles drive the Trojans out of\ncity immediately. What have I to do with quarrelling and helping people?\u201d\nHe was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As a cauldron upon \u2018a large fire boils when it is\nmelting the lard of some fatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when the dry faggots blaze under it\u2014\neven so were the goodly waters of Xanthus heated with the fire till they were boiling. He could flow no longer but\nstayed his stream, so afflicted was he by the blasts of fire which cunning Vulcan had raised. Then he prayed to Juno\nand besought her saying, \u201cJuno, why should your son vex my stream with such especial fury? I am not so much to\nblame as all the others are who have been helping the Trojans. I will leave off, since you so desire it, and let son leave\noff also. Furthermore I swear never again will I do anything to save the Trojans from destruction, not even when all\nTroy is burning in the flames which the Achaeans will kindle.\u201d\nAs soon as Juno heard this she said to her son Vulcan, \u201cSon Vulcan, hold now your flames; we ought not to use\nsuch violence against a god for the sake of mortals.\u201d\nWhen she had thus spoken Vulcan quenched his flames, and the river went back once more into his own fair\nbed.\nXanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Juno stayed them though she was still angry; but a\nfurious quarrel broke out among the other gods, for they were of divided counsels. They fell on one another with a\nmighty uproar\u2014earth groaned, and the spacious firmament rang out as with a blare of trumpets. Jove heard as he\nwas sitting on Olympus, and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming to blows among themselves. They were\nnot long about beginning, and Mars piercer of shields opened the battle. Sword in hand he sprang at once upon\nMinerva and reviled her. \u201cWhy, vixen,\u201d said he, \u201chave you again set the gods by the ears in the pride and haugh-\ntiness of your heart? Have you forgotten how you set Diomed son of Tydeus on to wound me, and yourself took\nvisible spear and drove it into me to the hurt of my fair body? You shall now suffer for what you then did to me.\u201d\nAs he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis\u2014so terrible that not even can Jove\u2019s lightning pierce it.\nHere did murderous Mars strike her with his great spear. She drew back and with her strong hand seized a stone\nthat was lying on the plain\u2014great and rugged and black \u2014 which men of old had set for the boundary of a field.\nWith this she struck Mars on the neck, and brought him down. Nine roods did he cover in his fall, and his hair was\nall soiled in the dust, while his armour rang rattling round him. But Minerva laughed and vaunted over him saying,\n\u201cIdiot, have you not learned how far stronger I am than you, but you must still match yourself against me? Thus do\nyour mother\u2019s curses now roost upon you, for she is angry and would do you mischief because you have deserted\nthe Achaeans and are helping the Trojans.\u201d\nShe then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Jove\u2019s daughter Venus took Mars by the hand and led\nhim away groaning all the time, for it was only with great difficulty that he had come to himself again. When Queen\nJuno saw her, she said to Minerva, \u201cLook, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, that vixen Venus is again\ntaking Mars through the crowd out of the battle; go after her at once.\u201d\nThus she spoke. Minerva sped after Venus with a will, and made at her, striking her on the bosom with her\nstrong hand so that she fell fainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at full length. Then Minerva\nvaunted over her saying, \u201cMay all who help the Trojans against the Argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwart\nas Venus did when she came across me while she was helping Mars. Had this been so, we should long since have\nended the war by sacking the strong city of Ilius.\u201d\nJuno smiled as she listened. Meanwhile King Neptune turned to Apollo saying, \u201cPhoebus, why should we keep\neach other at arm\u2019s length? it is not well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will be disgraceful to us if we\nreturn to Jove\u2019s bronze-floored mansion on Olympus without having fought each other; therefore come on, you\nare the younger of the two, and I ought not to attack you, for I am older and have had more experience. Idiot, you\nhave no sense, and forget how we two alone of all the gods fared hardly round about Ilius when we came from Jove\u2019s\nhouse and worked for Laomedon a whole year at a stated wage and he gave us his orders. I built the Trojans the\nwall about their city, so wide and fair that it might be impregnable, while you, Phoebus, herded cattle for him in the\ndales of many valleyed Ida. When, however, the glad hours brought round the time of payment, mighty Laomedon\nrobbed us of all our hire and sent us off with nothing but abuse. He threatened to bind us hand and foot and sell us\nover into some distant island. He tried, moreover, to cut off the ears of both of us, so we went away in a rage, furious\nabout the payment he had promised us, and yet withheld; in spite of all this, you are now showing favour to his\npeople, and will not join us in compassing the utter ruin of the proud Trojans with their wives and children.\u201d\nAnd King Apollo answered, \u201cLord of the earthquake, you would have no respect for me if I were to fight you\n215 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nabout a pack of miserable mortals, who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of the field, and presently\nfall lifeless to the ground. Let us stay this fighting at once and let them settle it among themselves.\u201d\nHe turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on the brother of his own father. But his sister the hunt-\nress Diana, patroness of wild beasts, was very angry with him and said, \u201cSo you would fly, Far-Darter, and hand\nvictory over to Neptune with a cheap vaunt to boot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me again hear\nyou bragging in my father\u2019s house, as you have often done in the presence of the immortals, that you would stand\nup and fight with Neptune.\u201d\nApollo made her no answer, but Jove\u2019s august queen was angry and upbraided her bitterly. \u201cBold vixen,\u201d she\ncried, \u201chow dare you cross me thus? For all your bow you will find it hard to hold your own against me. Jove made\nyou as a lion among women, and lets you kill them whenever you choose. You will And it better to chase wild beasts\nand deer upon the mountains than to fight those who are stronger than you are. If you would try war, do so, and\nfind out by pitting yourself against me, how far stronger I am than you are.\u201d\nShe caught both Diana\u2019s wrists with her left hand as she spoke, and with her right she took the bow from her\nshoulders, and laughed as she beat her with it about the ears while Diana wriggled and writhed under her blows.\nHer swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and she fled weeping from under Juno\u2019s hand as a dove that flies\nbefore a falcon to the cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortune to escape. Even so did she fly weeping\naway, leaving her bow and arrows behind her.\nThen the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, said to Leto, \u201cLeto, I shall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows\nwith any of Jove\u2019s wives. Therefore boast as you will among the immortals that you worsted me in fair fight.\u201d\nLeto then gathered up Diana\u2019s bow and arrows that had fallen about amid the whirling dust, and when she had\ngot them she made all haste after her daughter. Diana had now reached Jove\u2019s bronze-floored mansion on Olym-\npus, and sat herself down with many tears on the knees of her father, while her ambrosial raiment was quivering all\nabout her. The son of Saturn drew her towards him, and laughing pleasantly the while began to question her saying,\n\u201cWhich of the heavenly beings, my dear child, has been treating you in this cruel manner, as though you had been\nmisconducting yourself in the face of everybody?\u201d and the fair-crowned goddess of the chase answered, \u201cIt was\nyour wife Juno, father, who has been beating me; it is always her doing when there is any quarrelling among the\nimmortals.\u201d\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered the strong city of Ilius, for he was uneasy lest\nthe wall should not hold out and the Danaans should take the city then and there, before its hour had come; but the\nrest of the ever-living gods went back, some angry and some triumphant to Olympus, where they took their seats\nbeside Jove lord of the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept on dealing out death alike on the Trojans and on their\nAs when the smoke from some burning city ascends to heaven when the anger of the gods has kindled it\u2014there is\nthen toil for all, and sorrow for not a few\u2014even so did Achilles bring toil and sorrow on the Trojans.\nOld King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on huge Achilles as the Trojans fled pan-\nic-stricken before him, and there was none to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower and with many\na groan went along the wall to give orders to the brave warders of the gate. \u201cKeep the gates,\u201d said he, \u201cwide open\ntill the people come flying into the city, for Achilles is hard by and is driving them in rout before him. I see we are\nin great peril. As soon as our people are inside and in safety, close the strong gates for I fear lest that terrible man\nshould come bounding inside along with the others.\u201d\nAs he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and when these were opened there was a haven\nof refuge for the Trojans. Apollo then came full speed out of the city to meet them and protect them. Right for the\ncity and the high wall, parched with thirst and grimy with dust, still they fied on, with Achilles wielding his spear\nfuriously behind them. For he was as one possessed, and was thirsting after glory.\nThen had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy if Apollo had not spurred on Agenor, valiant\nand noble son to Antenor. He put courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him, leaning against a beech\ntree and shrouded in thick darkness. When Agenor saw Achilles he stood still and his heart was clouded with care.\n\u201cAlas,\u201d said he to himself in his dismay, \u201cif I fly before mighty Achilles, and go where all the others are being driven\nin rout, he will none the less catch me and kill me for a coward. How would it be were I to let Achilles drive the oth-\ners before him, and then fly from the wall to the plain that is behind Ilius till I reach the spurs of Ida and can hide\nin the underwood that is thereon? I could then wash the sweat from off me in the river and in the evening return to\nIlius. But why commune with myself in this way? Like enough he would see me as I am hurrying from the city over\nthe plain, and would speed after me till he had caught me\u2014I should stand no chance against him, for he is mighti-\nest of all mankind. What, then, if I go out and meet him in front of the city? His flesh too, I take it, can be pierced by\npointed bronze. Life is the same in one and all, and men say that he is but mortal despite the triumph that Jove son\nof Saturn vouchsafes him.\u201d\nSo saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was now fain to fight him. As a leopardess that\nbounds from out a thick covert to attack a hunter\u2014she knows no fear and is not dismayed by the baying of the\n216 The Iliad\nhounds; even though the man be too quick for her and wound her either with thrust or spear, still, though the spear\nhas pierced her she will not give in till she has either caught him in her grip or been killed outright\u2014even so did\nnoble Agenor son of Antenor refuse to fly till he had made trial of Achilles, and took aim at him with his spear,\nholding his round shield before him and crying with a loud voice. \u201cOf a truth,\u201d said he, \u201cnoble Achilles, you deem\nthat you shall this day sack the city of the proud Trojans. Fool, there will be trouble enough yet before it, for there\nis many a brave man of us still inside who will stand in front of our dear parents with our wives and children, to\ndefend Ilius. Here therefore, huge and mighty warrior though you be, here shall you cue.\nAs he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the spear struck Achilles on the leg beneath the\nknee; the greave of newly wrought tin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of him whom it had struck,\nand did not pierce it, for the gods gift stayed it. Achilles in his turn attacked noble Agenor, but Apollo would not\nvouchsafe him glory, for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in a thick mist, sending him out of the battle unmo-\nlested Then he craftily drew the son of Peleus away from going after the host, for he put on the semblance of Agenor\nand stood in front of Achilles, who ran towards him to give him chase and pursued him over the corn lands of the\nplain, turning him towards the deep waters of the river Scamander. Apollo ran but a little way before him and be-\nguiled Achilles by making him think all the time that he was on the point of overtaking him. Meanwhile the rabble\nof routed Trojans was thankful to crowd within the city till their numbers thronged it; no longer did they dare wait\nfor one another outside the city walls, to learn who had escaped and who were fallen in fight, but all whose feet and\nknees could still carry them poured pell-mell into the town.\nBook XXII\nTHUS the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat from off them and drank to quench their\nthirst, leaning against the goodly battlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon their shoulders drew\nclose up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hector stay where he was before Ilius and the Scaean gates. Then Phoe-\nbus Apollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying, \u201cWhy, son of Peleus, do you, who are but man, give chase to me who\nam immortal? Have you not yet found out that it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did not harass the\nTrojans whom you had routed, and now they are within their walls, while you have been decoyed hither away from\nthem. Me you cannot kill, for death can take no hold upon me.\u201d\nAchilles was greatly angered and said, \u201cYou have baulked me, Far-Darter, most malicious of all gods, and have\ndrawn me away from the wall, where many another man would have bitten the dust ere he got within Ilius; you\nhave robbed me of great glory and have saved the Trojans at no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but I\nwould indeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so.\u201d\nOn this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the winning horse in a chariot race strains every nerve\nwhen he is flying over the plain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs of Achilles bear him onwards. King Pri-\nam was first to note him as he scoured the plain, all radiant as the star which men call Orion\u2019s Hound, and whose\nbeams blaze forth in time of harvest more brilliantly than those of any other that shines by night; brightest of them\nall though he be, he yet bodes ill for mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train\u2014even so did Achilles\u2019 armour\ngleam on his breast as he sped onwards. Priam raised a cry and beat his head with his hands as he lifted them up\nand shouted out to his dear son, imploring him to return; but Hector still stayed before the gates, for his heart was\nset upon doing battle with Achilles. The old man reached out his arms towards him and bade him for pity\u2019s sake\ncome within the walls. \u201cHector,\u201d he cried, \u201cmy son, stay not to face this man alone and unsupported, or you will\nmeet death at the hands of the son of Peleus, for he is mightier than you. Monster that he is; would indeed that the\ngods loved him no better than I do, for so, dogs and vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched on earth,\nand a load of grief would be lifted from my heart, for many a brave son has he reft from me, either by killing them\nor selling them away in the islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two sons from among the Trojans who\nhave thronged within the city, Lycaon and Polydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they\nbe still alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom them with gold and bronze, of which we have store,\nfor the old man Altes endowed his daughter richly; but if they are already dead and in the house of Hades, sorrow\nwill it be to us two who were their parents; albeit the grief of others will be more short-lived unless you too perish\nat the hands of Achilles. Come, then, my son, within the city, to be the guardian of Trojan men and Trojan women,\nor you will both lose your own life and afford a mighty triumph to the son of Peleus. Have pity also on your un-\nhappy father while life yet remains to him\u2014on me, whom the son of Saturn will destroy by a terrible doom on the\nthreshold of old age, after I have seen my sons slain and my daughters haled away as captives, my bridal chambers\npillaged, little children dashed to earth amid the rage of battle, and my sons\u2019 wives dragged away by the cruel hands\nof the Achaeans; in the end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces at my own gates after some one has beaten the life\nout of my body with sword or spear-hounds that I myself reared and fed at my own table to guard my gates, but\nwho will yet lap my blood and then lie all distraught at my doors. When a young man falls by the sword in battle, he\n217 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nmay lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be seen, all is honourable in death, but when an old\nman is slain there is nothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs should defile his grey hair and beard and all\nthat men hide for shame.\u201d\nThe old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the heart of Hector. His mother hard by wept\nand moaned aloud as she bared her bosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. \u201cHector,\u201d she cried,\nweeping bitterly the while, \u201cHector, my son, spurn not this breast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given\nyou comfort from my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the wall to protect us from this man;\nstand not without to meet him. Should the wretch kill you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall ever weep,\ndear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogs will devour you at the ships of the Achaeans.\u201d\nThus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved not the heart of Hector, and he stood his\nground awaiting huge Achilles as he drew nearer towards him. As serpent in its den upon the mountains, full fed\nwith deadly poisons, waits for the approach of man\u2014he is filled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes\nwrithing round his den\u2014even so Hector leaned his shield against a tower that jutted out from the wall and stood\nwhere he was, undaunted.\n\u201cAlas,\u201d said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, \u201cif I go within the gates, Polydamas will be the first to\nheap reproach upon me, for it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the city on that awful night when\nAchilles again came forth against us. I would not listen, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so. Now\nthat my folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men and Trojan women in the face, lest a worse man\nshould say, \u2018Hector has ruined us by his self-confidence.\u2019 Surely it would be better for me to return after having\nfought Achilles and slain him, or to die gloriously here before the city. What, again, if were to lay down my shield\nand helmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight up to noble Achilles? What if I were to promise to give\nup Helen, who was the fountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that Alexandrus brought with him in his\nships to Troy, aye, and to let the Achaeans divide the half of everything that the city contains among themselves?\nI might make the Trojans, by the mouths of their princes, take a solemn oath that they would hide nothing, but\nwould divide into two shares all that is within the city\u2014but why argue with myself in this way? Were I to go up\nto him he would show me no kind of mercy; he would kill me then and there as easily as though I were a woman,\nwhen I had off my armour. There is no parleying with him from some rock or oak tree as young men and maidens\nprattle with one another. Better fight him at once, and learn to which of us Jove will vouchsafe victory.\u201d\nThus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it were Mars himself, plumed lord of battle. From\nhis right shoulder he brandished his terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamed around him like flashing\nfire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fell upon Hector as he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where he was\nbut fled in dismay from before the gates, while Achilles darted after him at his utmost speed. As a mountain falcon,\nswiftest of all birds, swoops down upon some cowering dove\u2014the dove flies before him but the falcon with a shrill\nscream follows close after, resolved to have her\u2014even so did Achilles make straight for Hector with all his might,\nwhile Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take him.\nOn they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the wall, past the lookout station, and past the\nweather-beaten wild fig-tree, till they came to two fair springs which feed the river Scamander. One of these two\nsprings is warm, and steam rises from it as smoke from a burning fire, but the other even in summer is as cold as\nhail or snow, or the ice that forms on water. Here, hard by the springs, are the goodly washing-troughs of stone,\nwhere in the time of peace before the coming of the Achaeans the wives and fair daughters of the Trojans used to\nwash their clothes. Past these did they fly, the one in front and the other giving ha. behind him: good was the man\nthat fled, but better far was he that followed after, and swiftly indeed did they run, for the prize was no mere beast\nfor sacrifice or bullock\u2019s hide, as it might be for a common foot-race, but they ran for the life of Hector. As horses in\na chariot race speed round the turning-posts when they are running for some great prize\u2014a tripod or woman\u2014at\nthe games in honour of some dead hero, so did these two run full speed three times round the city of Priam. All the\ngods watched them, and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.\n\u201cAlas,\u201d said he, \u201cmy eyes behold a man who is dear to me being pursued round the walls of Troy; my heart\nis full of pity for Hector, who has burned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my honour, at one while on the of\nmany-valleyed Ida, and again on the citadel of Troy; and now I see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him round the\ncity of Priam. What say you? Consider among yourselves and decide whether we shall now save him or let him fall,\nvaliant though he be, before Achilles, son of Peleus.\u201d\nThen Minerva said, \u201cFather, wielder of the lightning, lord of cloud and storm, what mean you? Would you\npluck this mortal whose doom has long been decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we others shall\nnot be of a mind with you.\u201d\nAnd Jove answered, \u201cMy child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not speak in full earnest, and I will let you have\nyour way. Do without let or hindrance as you are minded.\u201d\nThus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus.\n218 The Iliad\nAchilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing a fawn which he has started from its covert on\nthe mountains, and hunts through glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him by crouching under cover\nof a bush, but he will scent her out and follow her up until he gets her\u2014even so there was no escape for Hector\nfrom the fleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to get near the Dardanian gates and under the walls, that his\npeople might help him by showering down weapons from above, Achilles would gain on him and head him back\ntowards the plain, keeping himself always on the city side. As a man in a dream who fails to lay hands upon anoth-\ner whom he is pursuing\u2014the one cannot escape nor the other overtake\u2014even so neither could Achilles come up\nwith Hector, nor Hector break away from Achilles; nevertheless he might even yet have escaped death had not the\ntime come when Apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved his running, was now no longer to\nstay by him. Achilles made signs to the Achaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to aim a dart at\nHector, lest another might win the glory of having hit him and he might himself come in second. Then, at last, as\nthey were nearing the fountains for the fourth time, the father of all balanced his golden scales and placed a doom\nin each of them, one for Achilles and the other for Hector. As he held the scales by the middle, the doom of Hector\nfell down deep into the house of Hades\u2014and then Phoebus Apollo left him. Thereon Minerva went close up to the\nson of Peleus and said, \u201cNoble Achilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back to the ships a triumph for\nthe Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his lust of battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling before his father,\naegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer. Stay here and take breath, while I go up to him and persuade\nhim to make a stand and fight you.\u201d\nThus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still, leaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear,\nwhile Minerva left him and went after Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. She came close up to\nhim and said, \u201cDear brother, I see you are hard pressed by Achilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city\nof Priam, let us await his onset and stand on our defence.\u201d\nAnd Hector answered, \u201cDeiphobus, you have always been dearest to me of all my brothers, children of Hecuba\nand Priam, but henceforth I shall rate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have ventured outside the wall for my\nsake when all the others remain inside.\u201d\nThen Minerva said, \u201cDear brother, my father and mother went down on their knees and implored me, as did all\nmy comrades, to remain inside, so great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an agony of grief when I beheld\nyou; now, therefore, let us two make a stand and fight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve, that we\nmay learn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off our spoils to the ships, or whether he shall fall before you.\u201d\nThus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two were now close to one another great Hector\nwas first to speak. \u201cI will-no longer fly you, son of Peleus,\u201d said he, \u201cas I have been doing hitherto. Three times have\nI fled round the mighty city of Priam, without daring to withstand you, but now, let me either slay or be slain, for I\nam in the mind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges to one another by our gods, who are the fittest witnesses and\nguardians of all covenants; let it be agreed between us that if Jove vouchsafes me the longer stay and I take your life,\nI am not to treat your dead body in any unseemly fashion, but when I have stripped you of your armour, I am to\ngive up your body to the Achaeans. And do you likewise.\u201d\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \u201cFool, prate not to me about covenants. There can be no covenants\nbetween men and lions, wolves and lambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out an through.\nTherefore there can be no understanding between you and me, nor may there be any covenants between us, till one\nor other shall fall and glut grim Mars with his life\u2019s blood. Put forth all your strength; you have need now to prove\nyourself indeed a bold soldier and man of war. You have no more chance, and Pallas Minerva will forthwith van-\nquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full for the grief you have caused me on account of my comrades\nwhom you have killed in battle.\u201d\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw it coming and avoided it; he watched it and crouched\ndown so that it flew over his head and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched it up and gave it back to\nAchilles without Hector\u2019s seeing her; Hector thereon said to the son of Peleus, \u201cYou have missed your aim, Achil-\nles, peer of the gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you the hour of my doom, though you made sure that he had\ndone so. You were a false-tongued liar when you deemed that I should forget my valour and quail before you. You\nshall not drive spear into the back of a runaway\u2014drive it, should heaven so grant you power, drive it into me as I\nmake straight towards you; and now for your own part avoid my spear if you can\u2014would that you might receive\nthe whole of it into your body; if you were once dead the Trojans would find the war an easier matter, for it is you\nwho have harmed them most.\u201d\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was true for he hit the middle of Achilles\u2019 shield, but\nthe spear rebounded from it, and did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw that the weapon had sped from\nhis hand in vain, and stood there in dismay for he had no second spear. With a loud cry he called Diphobus and\nasked him for one, but there was no man; then he saw the truth and said to himself, \u201cAlas! the gods have lured me\non to my destruction. I deemed that the hero Deiphobus was by my side, but he is within the wall, and Minerva has\n219 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ninveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it\u2014for so Jove and his son\nApollo the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready to protect me. My doom has come\nupon me; let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great thing that shall be\ntold among men hereafter.\u201d\nAs he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong by his side, and gathering himself together be\nsprang on Achilles like a soaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb or timid hare\u2014even\nso did Hector brandish his sword and spring upon Achilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his\nwondrous shield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with four layers of metal, nodding fiercely for-\nward. The thick tresses of gold wi which Vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as the evening star that\nshines brighter than all others through the stillness of night, even such was the gleam of the spear which Achilles\npoised in his right hand, fraught with the death of noble Hector. He eyed his fair flesh over and over to see where\nhe could best wound it, but all was protected by the goodly armour of which Hector had spoiled Patroclus after he\nhad slain him, save only the throat where the collar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders, and this is a most\ndeadly place: here then did Achilles strike him as he was coming on towards him, and the point of his spear went\nright through the fleshy part of the neck, but it did not sever his windpipe so that he could still speak. Hector fell\nheadlong, and Achilles vaunted over him saying, \u201cHector, you deemed that you should come off scatheless when\nyou were spoiling Patroclus, and recked not of myself who was not with him. Fool that you were: for I, his comrade,\nmightier far than he, was still left behind him at the ships, and now I have laid you low. The Achaeans shall give him\nall due funeral rites, while dogs and vultures shall work their will upon yourself.\u201d\nThen Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, \u201cI pray you by your life and knees, and by your parents, let not\ndogs devour me at the ships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold and bronze which my father and\nmother will offer you, and send my body home, that the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when I\nam dead.\u201d\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \u201cDog, talk not to me neither of knees nor parents; would that I could be\nas sure of being able to cut your flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill have done me, as I am that nothing shall\nsave you from the dogs\u2014it shall not be, though they bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for me on\nthe spot, with promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son of Dardanus should bid them offer me your weight\nin gold, even so your mother shall never lay you out and make lament over the son she bore, but dogs and vultures\nshall eat you utterly up.\u201d\nHector with his dying breath then said, \u201cI know you what you are, and was sure that I should not move you, for\nyour heart is hard as iron; look to it that I bring not heaven\u2019s anger upon you on the day when Paris and Phoebus\nApollo, valiant though you be, shall slay you at the Scaean gates.\u201d\nWhen he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon his soul went out of him and flew down to\nthe house of Hades, lamenting its sad fate that it should en\u2019 youth and strength no longer. But Achilles said, speak-\ning to the dead body, \u201cDie; for my part I will accept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send it.\u201d\nAs he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one side; then he stripped the blood-stained armour\nfrom Hector\u2019s shoulders while the other Achaeans came running up to view his wondrous strength and beauty; and\nno one came near him without giving him a fresh wound. Then would one turn to his neighbour and say, \u201cIt is eas-\nier to handle Hector now than when he was flinging fire on to our ships\u201d and as he spoke he would thrust his spear\ninto him anew.\nWhen Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood among the Argives and said, \u201cMy friends,\nprinces and counsellors of the Argives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, who has done us\nmore hurt than all the others together, consider whether we should not attack the city in force, and discover in what\nmind the Trojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will desert their city now that Hector has fallen, or\nwill still hold out even though he is no longer living. But why argue with myself in this way, while Patroclus is still\nlying at the ships unburied, and unmourned\u2014he Whom I can never forget so long as I am alive and my strength\nfails not? Though men forget their dead when once they are within the house of Hades, yet not even there will I\nforget the comrade whom I have lost. Now, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raise the song of victory and go back\nto the ships taking this man along with us; for we have achieved a mighty triumph and have slain noble Hector to\nwhom the Trojans prayed throughout their city as though he were a god.\u201d\nOn this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced the sinews at the back of both his feet from\nheel to ancle and passed thongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the body fast to his chariot,\nletting the head trail upon the ground. Then when he had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself\nmounted, he lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth. The dust rose from Hector as he was being\ndragged along, his dark hair flew all abroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on earth, for Jove had now\ndelivered him into the hands of his foes to do him outrage in his own land.\nThus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. His mother tore her hair, and flung her veil from\n220 The Iliad\nher with a loud cry as she looked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, and throughout the city the peo-\nple fell to weeping and wailing. It was as though the whole of frowning Ilius was being smirched with fire. Hardly\ncould the people hold Priam back in his hot haste to rush without the gates of the city. He grovelled in the mire and\nbesought them, calling each one of them by his name. \u201cLet be, my friends,\u201d he cried, \u201cand for all your sorrow, suffer\nme to go single-handed to the ships of the Achaeans. Let me beseech this cruel and terrible man, if maybe he will\nrespect the feeling of his fellow-men, and have compassion on my old age. His own father is even such another as\nmyself\u2014Peleus, who bred him and reared him to\u2014be the bane of us Trojans, and of myself more than of all others.\nMany a son of mine has he slain in the flower of his youth, and yet, grieve for these as I may, I do so for one\u2014Hec-\ntor\u2014more than for them all, and the bitterness of my sorrow will bring me down to the house of Hades. Would that\nhe had died in my arms, for so both his ill-starred mother who bore him, and myself, should have had the comfort\nof weeping and mourning over him.\u201d\nThus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city joined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the\ncry of wailing among the Trojans. \u201cAlas, my son,\u201d she cried, \u201cwhat have I left to live for now that you are no more?\nNight and day did I glory in. you throughout the city, for you were a tower of strength to all in Troy, and both men\nand women alike hailed you as a god. So long as you lived you were their pride, but now death and destruction have\nfallen upon you.\u201d\nHector\u2019s wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to tell her that her husband had remained without\nthe gates. She was at her loom in an inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web, and embroidering it with\nmany flowers. She told her maids to set a large tripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hector when\nhe came out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was now beyond the reach of baths, and that Minerva had\nlaid him low by the hands of Achilles. She heard the cry coming as from the wall, and trembled in every limb; the\nshuttle fell from her hands, and again she spoke to her waiting-women. \u201cTwo of you,\u201d she said, \u201ccome with me that\nI may learn what it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of my husband\u2019s honoured mother; my own heart beats as\nthough it would come into my mouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great misfortune for Priam\u2019s children\nmust be at hand. May I never live to hear it, but I greatly fear that Achilles has cut off the retreat of brave Hector\nand has chased him on to the plain where he was singlehanded; I fear he may have put an end to the reckless daring\nwhich possessed my husband, who would never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on far in front,\nforemost of them all in valour.\u201d\nHer heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like a maniac, with her waiting-women follow-\ning after. When she reached the battlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon the wall, and\nsaw Hector being borne away in front of the city\u2014the horses dragging him without heed or care over the ground\ntowards the ships of the Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness of night and she fell fainting\nbackwards. She tore the tiring from her head and flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaited band, and\nthe veil which golden Venus had given her on the day when Hector took her with him from the house of Eetion,\nafter having given countless gifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband\u2019s sisters and the wives of his brothers crowd-\ned round her and supported her, for she was fain to die in her distraction; when she again presently breathed and\ncame to herself, she sobbed and made lament among the Trojans saying, \u2018Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to\nshare a common lot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes under the wooded mountain\nof Placus in the house of Eetion who brought me up when I was a child\u2014ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter\u2014\nwould that he had never begotten me. You are now going into the house of Hades under the secret places of the\nearth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your house. The child, of whom you and I are the unhappy parents, is\nas yet a mere infant. Now that you are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for him nor he for you. Even though he\nescape the horrors of this woful war with the Achaeans, yet shall his life henceforth be one of labour and sorrow, for\nothers will seize his lands. The day that robs a child of his parents severs him from his own kind; his head is bowed,\nhis cheeks are wet with tears, and he will go about destitute among the friends of his father, plucking one by the\ncloak and another by the shirt. Some one or other of these may so far pity him as to hold the cup for a moment to-\nwards him and let him moisten his lips, but he must not drink enough to wet the roof of his mouth; then one whose\nparents are alive will drive him from the table with blows and angry words. \u2018Out with you,\u2019 he will say, \u2018you have no\nfather here,\u2019 and the child will go crying back to his widowed mother\u2014he, Astyanax, who erewhile would sit upon\nhis father\u2019s knees, and have none but the daintiest and choicest morsels set before him. When he had played till he\nwas tired and went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in the arms of his nurse, on a soft couch, knowing neither want\nnor care, whereas now that he has lost his father his lot will be full of hardship\u2014he, whom the Trojans name Astya-\nnax, because you, O Hector, were the only defence of their gates and battlements. The wriggling writhing worms\nwill now eat you at the ships, far from your parents, when the dogs have glutted themselves upon you. You will lie\nnaked, although in your house you have fine and goodly raiment made by hands of women. This will I now burn;\nit is of no use to you, for you can never again wear it, and thus you will have respect shown you by the Trojans both\nmen and women.\u201d\n221 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nIn such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women joined in her lament.\nBook XXIII\nTHUS did they make their moan throughout the city, while the Achaeans when they reached the Hellespont\nwent back every man to his own ship. But Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke to his brave com-\nrades saying, \u201cMyrmidons, famed horsemen and my own trusted friends, not yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but with\nhorse and chariot draw near to the body and mourn Patroclus, in due honour to the dead. When we have had full\ncomfort of lamentation we will unyoke our horses and take supper all of us here.\u201d\nOn this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them in their lament. Thrice did they drive their\nchariots all sorrowing round the body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning. The sands of the\nseashore and the men\u2019s armour were wet with their weeping, so great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost.\nChief in all their mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid his bloodstained hand on the breast of his friend. \u201cFare\nwell,\u201d he cried, \u201cPatroclus, even in the house of Hades. I will now do all that I erewhile promised you; I will drag\nHector hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge\nyou.\u201d\nAs he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely, laying it at full length in the dust beside the\nbier of Patroclus. The others then put off every man his armour, took the horses from their chariots, and seated\nthemselves in great multitude by the ship of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them with an\nabundant funeral banquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did they butcher and cut up;\nmany a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed, did they singe and set to roast in the flames of Vulcan; and rivulets\nof blood flowed all round the place where the body was lying.\nThen the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus to Agamemnon, but hardly could they persuade him\nto come with them, so wroth was he for the death of his comrade. As soon as they reached Agamemnon\u2019s tent they\ntold the serving-men to set a large tripod over the fire in case they might persuade the son of Peleus \u2018to wash the\nclotted gore from this body, but he denied them sternly, and swore it with a solemn oath, saying, \u201cNay, by King\nJove, first and mightiest of all gods, it is not meet that water should touch my body, till I have laid Patroclus on the\nflames, have built him a barrow, and shaved my head\u2014for so long as I live no such second sorrow shall ever draw\nnigh me. Now, therefore, let us do all that this sad festival demands, but at break of day, King Agamemnon, bid your\nmen bring wood, and provide all else that the dead may duly take into the realm of darkness; the fire shall thus burn\nhim out of our sight the sooner, and the people shall turn again to their own labours.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made haste to prepare the meal, they ate, and every\nman had his full share so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had had enough to eat and drink, the others\nwent to their rest each in his own tent, but the son of Peleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of the\nsounding sea, in an open place where the waves came surging in one after another. Here a very deep slumber took\nhold upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasing Hector round windy\nIlius. Presently the sad spirit of Patroclus drew near him, like what he had been in stature, voice, and the light of his\nbeaming eyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. The spirit hovered over his head and said\u2014\n\u201cYou sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living, but now that I am dead you think for me no\nfurther. Bury me with all speed that I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain shadows of men that can labour\nno more, drive me away from them; they will not yet suffer me to join those that are beyond the river, and I wander\nall desolate by the wide gates of the house of Hades. Give me now your hand I pray you, for when you have once\ngiven me my dues of fire, never shall I again come forth out of the house of Hades. Nevermore shall we sit apart and\ntake sweet counsel among the living; the cruel fate which was my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around me\u2014\nnay, you too Achilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the wall of the noble Trojans.\n\u201cOne prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not my bones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but\nwith them; even as we were brought up together in your own home, what time Menoetius brought me to you as a\nchild from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killed the son of Amphidamas\u2014not of set purpose, but in childish\nquarrel over the dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreated me kindly, and named me to be your\nsquire; therefore let our bones lie in but a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you by your mother.\u201d\nAnd Achilles answered, \u201cWhy, true heart, are you come hither to lay these charges upon me? will of my own\nself do all as you have bidden me. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms around one another, and\nfind sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows.\u201d\nHe opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped him in them, but there was nothing, and\nthe spirit vanished as a vapour, gibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to his feet, smote his two\nhands, and made lamentation saying, \u201cOf a truth even in the house of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms that\nhave no life in them; all night long the sad spirit of Patroclus has hovered over head making piteous moan, telling\n222 The Iliad\nme what I am to do for him, and looking wondrously like himself.\u201d\nThus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning about the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fin-\ngered morn appeared. Then King Agamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bring wood, and\nMeriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them. They went out with woodmen\u2019s axes and strong ropes in\ntheir hands, and before them went the mules. Up hill and down dale did they go, by straight ways and crooked, and\nwhen they reached the heights of many-fountained Ida, they laid their axes to the roots of many a tall branching\noak that came thundering down as they felled it. They split the trees and bound them behind the mules, which then\nwended their way as they best could through the thick brushwood on to the plain. All who had been cutting wood\nbore logs, for so Meriones squire to Idomeneus had bidden them, and they threw them down in a line upon the\nseashore at the place where Achilles would make a mighty monument for Patroclus and for himself.\nWhen they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole ground, they stayed all of them where\nthey were, but Achilles ordered his brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke each man his horses;\nthey therefore rose, girded on their armour and mounted each his chariot\u2014they and their charioteers with them.\nThe chariots went before, and they that were on foot followed as a cloud in their tens of thousands after. In the\nmidst of them his comrades bore Patroclus and covered him with the locks of their hair which they cut off and\nthrew upon his body. Last came Achilles with his head bowed for sorrow, so noble a comrade was he taking to the\nhouse of Hades.\nWhen they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they laid the body down and built up the wood.\nAchilles then bethought him of another matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut off the yellow lock\nwhich he had let grow for the river Spercheius. He looked all sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, \u201cSper-\ncheius, in vain did my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned home to my loved native land I should cut off\nthis lock and offer you a holy hecatomb; fifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at your springs, where is your\ngrove and your altar fragrant with burnt-offerings. Thus did my father vow, but you have not fulfilled his prayer;\nnow, therefore, that I shall see my home no more, I give this lock as a keepsake to the hero Patroclus.\u201d\nAs he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, and all who stood by were filled with yearning\nand lamentation. The sun would have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presently said to Agamem-\nnon, \u201cSon of Atreus, for it is to you that the people will give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from\nmourning; bid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting their dinners: we, to whom the dead is dearest,\nwill see to what is wanted here, and let the other princes also stay by me.\u201d\nWhen King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their ships, but those who were about the dead\nheaped up wood and built a pyre a hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all sorrowfully upon\nthe top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheep and oxen before the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of\nthem and wrapped the body therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed carcases all round it. Against the bier he\nleaned two-handled jars of honey and unguents; four proud horses did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning the\nwhile he did so. The dead hero had had house-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay and threw upon the pyre; he also\nput twelve brave sons of noble Trojans to the sword and laid them with the rest, for he was full of bitterness and\nfury. Then he committed all to the resistless and devouring might of the fire; he groaned aloud and callid on his\ndead comrade by name. \u201cFare well,\u201d he cried, \u201cPatroclus, even in the house of Hades; I am now doing all that I have\npromised you. Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans shall the flames consume along with yourself, but dogs, not fire,\nshall devour the flesh of Hector son of Priam.\u201d\nThus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector, for Jove\u2019s daughter Venus kept them off\nhim night and day, and anointed him with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be torn when Achilles was\ndragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreover sent a dark cloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to the\nwhole place where Hector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch his body.\nNow the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achilles therefore bethought him of another matter; he\nwent apart and prayed to the two winds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. He made them many\ndrink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them to come and help him that the wood might make haste to\nkindle and the dead bodies be consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying and started off to fetch the winds. They were\nholding high feast in the house of boisterous Zephyrus when Iris came running up to the stone threshold of the\nhouse and stood there, but as soon as they set eyes on her they all came towards her and each of them called her to\nhim, but Iris would not sit down. \u201cI cannot stay,\u201d she said, \u201cI must go back to the streams of Oceanus and the land\nof the Ethiopians who are offering hecatombs to the immortals, and I would have my share; but Achilles prays that\nBoreas and shrill Zephyrus will come to him, and he vows them goodly offerings; he would have you blow upon the\npyre of Patroclus for whom all the Achaeans are lamenting.\u201d\nWith this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rent the air and swept the clouds before them.\nThey blew on and on until they came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but when they reached Troy\nthey fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames roared under the blast that they blew. All night long did they blow\n223 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nhard and beat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp his double cup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl\nof gold, and calling upon the spirit of dead Patroclus as he poured it upon the ground until the earth was drenched.\nAs a father mourns when he is burning the bones of his bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of his\nparents, even so did Achilles mourn while burning the body of his comrade, pacing round the bier with piteous\ngroaning and lamentation.\nAt length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light which saffron-mantled Dawn was soon to\nsuffuse over the sea, the flames fell and the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyond the Thracian sea,\nwhich roared and boiled as they swept over it. The son of Peleus now turned away from the pyre and lay down,\novercome with toil, till he fell into a sweet slumber. Presently they who were about the son of Atreus drew near in\na body, and roused him with the noise and tramp of their coming. He sat upright and said, \u201cSon of Atreus, and all\nother princes of the Achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere upon the fire and quench it; let us then gather the\nbones of Patroclus son of Menoetius, singling them out with care; they are easily found, for they lie in the middle of\nthe pyre, while all else, both men and horses, has been thrown in a heap and burned at the outer edge. We will lay\nthe bones in a golden urn, in two layers of fat, against the time when I shall myself go down into the house of Ha-\ndes. As for the barrow, labour not to raise a great one now, but such as is reasonable. Afterwards, let those Achaeans\nwho may be left at the ships when I am gone, build it both broad and high.\u201d\nThus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. First they poured red wine upon the thick layer\nof ashes and quenched the fire. With many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their loved comrade and\nlaid them within a golden urn in two layers of fat: they then covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside the\ntent. They marked off the circle where the barrow should be, made a foundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith\nheaped up the earth. When they had thus raised a mound they were going away, but Achilles stayed the people and\nmade them sit in assembly. He brought prizes from the ships-cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, noble oxen,\nwomen with fair girdles, and swart iron.\nThe first prize he offered was for the chariot races\u2014a woman skilled in all useful arts, and a three-legged caul-\ndron that had ears for handles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for the man who came in first. For\nthe second there was a six-year old mare, unbroken, and in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly cauldron\nthat had never yet been on the fire; it was still bright as when it left the maker, and would hold four measures. The\nfourth prize was two talents of gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by smoke. Then he stood up\nand spoke among the Argives saying\u2014\n\u201cSon of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes that lie waiting the winners of the chariot races. At\nany other time I should carry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you know how far my steeds excel all\nothers\u2014for they are immortal; Neptune gave them to my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to myself; but I\nshall hold aloof, I and my steeds that have lost their brave and kind driver, who many a time has washed them in\nclear water and anointed their manes with oil. See how they stand weeping here, with their manes trailing on the\nground in the extremity of their sorrow. But do you others set yourselves in order throughout the host, whosoever\nhas confidence in his horses and in the strength of his chariot.\u201d\nThus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirred themselves. First among them all uprose\nEumelus, king of men, son of Admetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mighty Diomed son of\nTydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had taken from Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next\nto him, yellow-haired Menelaus son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet horses, Agamemnon\u2019s mare Aethe, and his\nown horse Podargus. The mare had been given to Agamemnon by echepolus son of Anchises, that he might not\nhave to follow him to Ilius, but might stay at home and take his ease; for Jove had endowed him with great wealth\nand he lived in spacious Sicyon. This mare, all eager for the race, did Menelaus put under the yoke.\nFourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus, made ready his horses. These were bred in\nPylos, and his father came up to him to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in but little need. \u201cAn-\ntilochus,\u201d said Nestor, \u201cyou are young, but Jove and Neptune have loved you well, and have made you an excellent\nhorseman. I need not therefore say much by way of instruction. You are skilful at wheeling your horses round the\npost, but the horses themselves are very slow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar your chances. The other drivers\nknow less than you do, but their horses are fleeter; therefore, my dear son, see if you cannot hit upon some artifice\nwhereby you may insure that the prize shall not slip through your fingers. The woodman does more by skill than by\nbrute force; by skill the pilot guides his storm-tossed barque over the sea, and so by skill one driver can beat anoth-\ner. If a man go wide in rounding this way and that, whereas a man who knows what he is doing may have worse\nhorses, but he will keep them well in hand when he sees the doubling-post; he knows the precise moment at which\nto pull the rein, and keeps his eye well on the man in front of him. I will give you this certain token which cannot\nescape your notice. There is a stump of a dead tree-oak or pine as it may be\u2014some six feet above the ground, and\nnot yet rotted away by rain; it stands at the fork of the road; it has two white stones set one on each side, and there is\na clear course all round it. It may have been a monument to some one long since dead, or it may have been used as a\n224 The Iliad\ndoubling-post in days gone by; now, however, it has been fixed on by Achilles as the mark round which the chari-\nots shall turn; hug it as close as you can, but as you stand in your chariot lean over a little to the left; urge on your\nright-hand horse with voice and lash, and give him a loose rein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in, that the\nnave of your wheel shall almost graze the post; but mind the stone, or you will wound your horses and break your\nchariot in pieces, which would be sport for others but confusion for yourself. Therefore, my dear son, mind well\nwhat you are about, for if you can be first to round the post there is no chance of any one giving you the goby later,\nnot even though you had Adrestus\u2019s horse Arion behind you horse which is of divine race\u2014or those of Laomedon,\nwhich are the noblest in this country.\u201d\nWhen Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down in his place, and fifth in order Meriones got\nready his horses. They then all mounted their chariots and cast lots.\u2014Achilles shook the helmet, and the lot of An-\ntilochus son of Nestor fell out first; next came that of King Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus son of Atreus\nand of Meriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomed son of Tydeus, who was the best man of them all. They took\ntheir places in line; Achilles showed them the doubling-post round which they were to turn, some way off upon the\nplain; here he stationed his father\u2019s follower Phoenix as umpire, to note the running, and report truly.\nAt the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck them with the reins, and shouted at them with\nall their might. They flew full speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose from under them as it were a\ncloud or whirlwind, and their manes were all flying in the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch the\nground, and then again they bounded into the air; the drivers stood erect, and their hearts beat fast and furious in\ntheir lust of victory. Each kept calling on his horses, and the horses scoured the plain amid the clouds of dust that\nthey raised.\nIt was when they were doing the last part of the course on their way back towards the sea that their pace was\nstrained to the utmost and it was seen what each could do. The horses of the descendant of Pheres now took the\nlead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallions of Diomed. They seemed as if about to mount Eumelus\u2019s\nchariot, and he could feel their warm breath on his back and on his broad shoulders, for their heads were close to\nhim as they flew over the course. Diomed would have now passed him, or there would have been a dead heat, but\nPhoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his whip. Tears of anger fell from his eyes as he saw the mares going on\nfaster than ever, while his own horses lost ground through his having no whip. Minerva saw the trick which Apollo\nhad played the son of Tydeus, so she brought him his whip and put spirit into his horses; moreover she went after\nthe son of Admetus in a rage and broke his yoke for him; the mares went one to one side the course, and the other\nto the other, and the pole was broken against the ground. Eumelus was thrown from his chariot close to the wheel;\nhis elbows, mouth, and nostrils were all torn, and his forehead was bruised above his eyebrows; his eyes filled with\ntears and he could find no utterance. But the son of Tydeus turned his horses aside and shot far ahead, for Minerva\nput fresh strength into them and covered Diomed himself with glory.\nMenelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus called to his father\u2019s horses. \u201cOn with you both,\u201d\nhe cried, \u201cand do your very utmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son of Tydeus, for Minerva has put\nrunning into them, and has covered Diomed with glory; but you must overtake the horses of the son of Atreus and\nnot be left behind, or Aethe who is so fleet will taunt you. Why, my good fellows, are you lagging? I tell you, and\nit shall surely be\u2014Nestor will keep neither of you, but will put both of you to the sword, if we win any the worse a\nprize through your carelessness, fly after them at your utmost speed; I will hit on a plan for passing them in a nar-\nrow part of the way, and it shall not fail me.\u201d\nThey feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space went quicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow\nplace where the road had sunk. The ground was broken, for the winter\u2019s rain had gathered and had worn the road\nso that the whole place was deepened. Menelaus was making towards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, but\nAntilochus turned his horses out of the way, and followed him a little on one side. The son of Atreus was afraid and\nshouted out, \u201cAntilochus, you are driving recklessly; rein in your horses; the road is too narrow here, it will be wider\nsoon, and you can pass me then; if you foul my chariot you may bring both of us to a mischief.\u201d\nBut Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had not heard him. They went side by side for\nabout as far as a young man can hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his strength, and then Menelaus\u2019s\nmares drew behind, for he left off driving for fear the horses should foul one another and upset the chariots; thus,\nwhile pressing on in quest of victory, they might both come headlong to the ground. Menelaus then upbraided An-\ntilochus and said, \u201cThere is no greater trickster living than you are; go, and bad luck go with you; the Achaeans say\nnot well that you have understanding, and come what may you shall not bear away the prize without sworn protest\non my part.\u201d\nThen he called on his horses and said to them, \u201cKeep your pace, and slacken not; the limbs of the other horses\nwill weary sooner than yours, for they are neither of them young.\u201d\nThe horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so that they were soon nearly up with the others.\nMeanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horses went, as they scoured the plain amid\n225 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nclouds of their own dust. Idomeneus captain of the Cretans was first to make out the running, for he was not in\nthe thick of the crowd, but stood on the most commanding part of the ground. The driver was a long way off, but\nIdomeneus could hear him shouting, and could see the foremost horse quite plainly\u2014a chestnut with a round white\nstar, like the moon, on its forehead. He stood up and said among the Argives, \u201cMy friends, princes and counsellors\nof the Argives, can you see the running as well as I can? There seems to be another pair in front now, and another\ndriver; those that led off at the start must have been disabled out on the plain. I saw them at first making their way\nround the doubling-post, but now, though I search the plain of Troy, I cannot find them. Perhaps the reins fell from\nthe driver\u2019s hand so that he lost command of his horses at the doubling-post, and could not turn it. I suppose he\nmust have been thrown out there, and broken his chariot, while his mares have left the course and gone off wildly in\na panic. Come up and see for yourselves, I cannot make out for certain, but the driver seems an Aetolian by descent,\nruler over the Argives, brave Diomed the son of Tydeus.\u201d\nAjax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, \u201cIdomeneus, why should you be in such a hurry to tell us\nall about it, when the mares are still so far out upon the plain? You are none of the youngest, nor your eyes none of\nthe sharpest, but you are always laying down the law. You have no right to do so, for there are better men here than\nyou are. Eumelus\u2019s horses are in front now, as they always have been, and he is on the chariot holding the reins.\u201d\nThe captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, \u201cAjax you are an excellent railer, but you have no judge-\nment, and are wanting in much else as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a tripod or cauldron, and\nAgamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose horses are first. You will then know to your cost.\u201d\nAjax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there would have been yet further brawling\nbetween them, had not Achilles risen in his place and said, \u201cCease your railing Ajax and Idomeneus; it is not you\nwould be scandalised if you saw any one else do the like: sit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speed-\ning towards the winning-post and will be bere directly. You will then both of you know whose horses are first, and\nwhose come after.\u201d\nAs he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his whip lustily from his shoulder, and his horses\nstepping high as they flew over the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver, and the chariot inlaid\nwith gold and tin ran close behind his fleet horses. There was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and the\nhorses came flying in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them in the middle of the crowd, and the sweat from\ntheir manes and chests fell in streams on to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from his goodly chariot, and leaned\nhis whip against his horses\u2019 yoke; brave Sthenelus now lost no time, but at once brought on the prize, and gave the\nwoman and the ear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away. Then he unyoked the horses.\nNext after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who had passed Menelaus by a trick and not by the\nfleetness of his horses; but even so Menelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse that draws\nboth the chariot and its master. The end hairs of a horse\u2019s tail touch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never much\nspace between wheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelaus was no further than this behind Antilochus,\nthough at first he had been a full disc\u2019s throw behind him. He had soon caught him up again, for Agamemnon\u2019s\nmare Aethe kept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the course had been longer he would have passed him, and\nthere would not even have been a dead heat. Idomeneus\u2019s brave squire Meriones was about a spear\u2019s cast behind\nMenelaus. His horses were slowest of all, and he was the worst driver. Last of them all came the son of Admetus,\ndragging his chariot and driving his horses on in front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry, and stood up among\nthe Argives saying, \u201cThe best man is coming in last. Let us give him a prize for it is reasonable. He shall have the\nsecond, but the first must go to the son of Tydeus.\u201d\nThus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying, and were for doing as he had said, but\nNestor\u2019s son Antilochus stood up and claimed his rights from the son of Peleus. \u201cAchilles,\u201d said he, \u201cI shall take it\nmuch amiss if you do this thing; you would rob me of my prize, because you think Eumelus\u2019s chariot and horses\nwere thrown out, and himself too, good man that he is. He should have prayed duly to the immortals; he would not\nhave come in fast if he had done so. If you are sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in your tents, with\nbronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something from this store if you would have the Achaeans speak well of you,\nand give him a better prize even than that which you have now offered; but I will not give up the mare, and he that\nwill fight me for her, let him come on.\u201d\nAchilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus, who was one of his dearest comrades. So he\nsaid\u2014\n\u201cAntilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I will give him the bronze breastplate with a rim\nof tin running all round it which I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to him.\u201d\nHe bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent, and he did so. Achilles then gave it over to\nEumelus, who received it gladly.\nBut Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. An attendant placed his staff in his hands and\nbade the Argives keep silence: the hero then addressed them. \u201cAntilochus,\u201d said he, \u201cwhat is this from you who have\n226 The Iliad\nbeen so far blameless? You have made me cut a poor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front\nof them, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, O princes and counsellors of the Argives, judge\nbetween us and show no favour, lest one of the Achaeans say, \u2018Menelaus has got the mare through lying and corrup-\ntion; his horses were far inferior to Antilochus\u2019s, but he has greater weight and influence.\u2019 Nay, I will determine the\nmatter myself, and no man will blame me, for I shall do what is just. Come here, Antilochus, and stand, as our cus-\ntom is, whip in hand before your chariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, and swear by earth-encircling\nNeptune that you did not purposely and guilefully get in the way of my horses.\u201d\nAnd Antilochus answered, \u201cForgive me; I am much younger, King Menelaus, than you are; you stand higher\nthan I do and are the better man of the two; you know how easily young men are betrayed into indiscretion; their\ntempers are more hasty and they have less judgement; make due allowances therefore, and bear with me; I will of\nmy own accord give up the mare that I have won, and if you claim any further chattel from my own possessions,\nI would rather yield it to you, at once, than fall from your good graces henceforth, and do wrong in the sight of\nheaven.\u201d\nThe son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over to Menelaus, whose anger was thus appeased; as when\ndew falls upon a field of ripening corn, and the lands are bristling with the harvest\u2014even so, O Menelaus, was your\nheart made glad within you. He turned to Antilochus and said, \u201cNow, Antilochus, angry though I have been, I can\ngive way to you of my own free will; you have never been headstrong nor ill-disposed hitherto, but this time your\nyouth has got the better of your judgement; be careful how you outwit your betters in future; no one else could have\nbrought me round so easily, but your good father, your brother, and yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on\nmy behalf; I therefore yield to your entreaty, and will give up the mare to you, mine though it indeed be; the people\nwill thus see that I am neither harsh nor vindictive.\u201d\nWith this he gave the mare over to Antilochus\u2019s comrade Noemon, and then took the cauldron. Meriones, who\nhad come in fourth, carried off the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the two-handled urn, being unawarded,\nAchilles gave it to Nestor, going up to him among the assembled Argives and saying, \u201cTake this, my good old friend,\nas an heirloom and memorial of the funeral of Patroclus\u2014for you shall see him no more among the Argives. I give\nyou this prize though you cannot win one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight, and cannot enter for the jave-\nlin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of age has been laid heavily upon you.\u201d\nSo saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly and answered, \u201cMy son, all that you have said is\ntrue; there is no strength now in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands from either shoulder. Would that\nI were still young and strong as when the Epeans were burying King Amarynceus in Buprasium, and his sons of-\nfered prizes in his honour. There was then none that could vie with me neither of the Epeans nor the Pylians them-\nselves nor the Aetolians. In boxing I overcame Clytomedes son of Enops, and in wrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron who\nhad come forward against me. Iphiclus was a good runner, but I beat him, and threw farther with my spear than\neither Phyleus or Polydorus. In chariot-racing alone did the two sons of Actor surpass me by crowding their horses\nin front of me, for they were angry at the way victory had gone, and at the greater part of the prizes remaining in\nthe place in which they had been offered. They were twins, and the one kept on holding the reins, and holding the\nreins, while the other plied the whip. Such was I then, but now I must leave these matters to younger men; I must\nbow before the weight of years, but in those days I was eminent among heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral\ncontests in honour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart rejoices that you do not forget me but\nare ever mindful of my goodwill towards you, and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans. For all which may\nthe grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance.\u201d\nThereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks of Nestor, went about among the concourse\nof the Achaeans, and presently offered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. He brought out a strong mule,\nand made it fast in the middle of the crowd\u2014a she-mule never yet broken, but six years old\u2014when it is hardest of\nall to break them: this was for the victor, and for the vanquished he offered a double cup. Then he stood up and said\namong the Argives, \u201cSon of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, I invite our two champion boxers to lay about them\nlustily and compete for these prizes. He to whom Apollo vouchsafes the greater endurance, and whom the Achae-\nans acknowledge as victor, shall take the mule back with him to his own tent, while he that is vanquished shall have\nthe double cup.\u201d\nAs he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and great stature, a skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus.\nHe laid his hand on the mule and said, \u201cLet the man who is to have the cup come hither, for none but myself will\ntake the mule. I am the best boxer of all here present, and none can beat me. Is it not enough that I should fall short\nof you in actual fighting? Still, no man can be good at everything. I tell you plainly, and it shall come true; if any\nman will box with me I will bruise his body and break his bones; therefore let his friends stay here in a body and be\nat hand to take him away when I have done with him.\u201d\nThey all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son of Mecisteus, who was son of Talaus. Mecisteus\nwent once to Thebes after the fall of Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all the people of Cadmus. The son\n227 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nof Tydeus was Euryalus\u2019s second, cheering him on and hoping heartily that he would win. First he put a waist-\nband round him and then he gave him some well-cut thongs of ox-hide; the two men being now girt went into the\nmiddle of the ring, and immediately fell to; heavily indeed did they punish one another and lay about them with\ntheir brawny fists. One could hear the horrid crashing of their jaws, and they sweated from every pore of their skin.\nPresently Epeus came on and gave Euryalus a blow on the jaw as he was looking round; Euryalus could not keep\nhis legs; they gave way under him in a moment and he sprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps into the air near\nsome shore that is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when Boreas furs the top of the waves, and then falls back into deep\nwater. But noble Epeus caught hold of him and raised him up; his comrades also came round him and led him from\nthe ring, unsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one side, and spitting great clots of gore. They set him down in a\nswoon and then went to fetch the double cup.\nThe son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contest and showed them to the Argives. These were\nfor the painful art of wrestling. For the winner there was a great tripod ready for setting upon the fire, and the\nAchaeans valued it among themselves at twelve oxen. For the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner of\narts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among the Argives, \u201cStand forward, you who will essay this\ncontest.\u201d\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and crafty Ulysses, full of wiles rose also. The two girded\nthemselves and went into the middle of the ring. They gripped each other in their strong hands like the rafters\nwhich some master-builder frames for the roof of a high house to keep the wind out. Their backbones cracked as\nthey tugged at one another with their mighty arms\u2014and sweat rained from them in torrents. Many a bloody weal\nsprang up on their sides and shoulders, but they kept on striving with might and main for victory and to win the\ntripod. Ulysses could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him; Ulysses was too strong for him; but when the Achaeans began\nto tire of watching them, Ajax said to ulysses, \u201cUlysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall either lift me, or I you, and let\nJove settle it between us.\u201d\nHe lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did not forget his cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow\nat back of his knee, so that he could not keep his feet, but fell on his back with Ulysses lying upon his chest, and all\nwho saw it marvelled. Then Ulysses in turn lifted Ajax and stirred him a little from the ground but could not lift\nhim right off it, his knee sank under him, and the two fell side by side on the ground and were all begrimed with\ndust. They now sprang towards one another and were for wrestling yet a third time, but Achilles rose and stayed\nthem. \u201cPut not each other further,\u201d said he, \u201cto such cruel suffering; the victory is with both alike, take each of you\nan equal prize, and let the other Achaeans now compete.\u201d\nThus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on their shirts again after wiping the dust from off\ntheir bodies.\nThe son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running\u2014a mixing-bowl beautifully wrought, of pure silver.\nIt would hold six measures, and far exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty; it was the work of cunning\nartificers in Sidon, and had been brought into port by Phoenicians from beyond the sea, who had made a present\nof it to Thoas. Eueneus son of jason had given it to Patroclus in ransom of Priam\u2019s son Lycaon, and Achilles now\noffered it as a prize in honour of his comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. For the second prize he\noffered a large ox, well fattened, while for the last there was to be half a talent of gold. He then rose and said among\nthe Argives, \u201cStand forward, you who will essay this contest.\u201d\nForthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses, and Nestor\u2019s son Antilochus, the fastest runner\namong all the youth of his time. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal. The course was set out\nfor them from the starting-post, and the son of Oileus took the lead at once, with Ulysses as close behind him as\nthe shuttle is to a woman\u2019s bosom when she throws the woof across the warp and holds it close up to her; even so\nclose behind him was Ulysses\u2014treading in his footprints before the dust could settle there, and Ajax could feel his\nbreath on the back of his head as he ran swiftly on. The Achaeans all shouted applause as they saw him straining\nhis utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when they were now nearing the end of the course Ulysses\nprayed inwardly to Minerva. \u201cHear me,\u201d he cried, \u201cand help my feet, O goddess.\u201d Thus did he pray, and Pallas Min-\nerva heard his prayer; she made his hands and his feet feel light, and when the runners were at the point of pounc-\ning upon the prize, Ajax, through Minerva\u2019s spite slipped upon some offal that was lying there from the cattle which\nAchilles had slaughtered in honour of Patroclus, and his mouth and nostrils were all filled with cow dung. Ulysses\ntherefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got before Ajax and came in first. But Ajax took the ox and stood with\nhis hand on one of its horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth. Then he said to the Argives, \u201cAlas, the goddess has\nspoiled my running; she watches over Ulysses and stands by him as though she were his own mother.\u201d Thus did he\nspeak and they all of them laughed heartily.\nAntilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to the bystanders, \u201cYou all see, my friends, that now\ntoo the gods have shown their respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and as for Ulysses, he be-\nlongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale in spite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against him\n228 The Iliad\nsave only Achilles.\u201d\nHe said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, and Achilles answered, \u201cAntilochus, you shall not have\npraised me to no purpose; I shall give you an additional half talent of gold.\u201d He then gave the half talent to Antilo-\nchus, who received it gladly.\nThen the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield that had been borne by Sarpedon, and were\ntaken from him by Patroclus. He stood up and said among the Argives, \u201cWe bid two champions put on their ar-\nmour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another in the presence of the multitude; whichever of them can\nfirst wound the flesh of the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to him will I give this goodly Thracian\nsword inlaid with silver, which I took from Asteropaeus, but the armour let both hold in partnership, and I will give\neach of them a hearty meal in my own tent.\u201d\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty Diomed son of Tydeus. When they had put on\ntheir armour each on his own side of the ring, they both went into the middle eager to engage, and with fire flash-\ning from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelled as they beheld them, and when the two were now close up with one\nanother, thrice did they spring forward and thrice try to strike each other in close combat. Ajax pierced Diomed\u2019s\nround shield, but did not draw blood, for the cuirass beneath the shield protected him; thereon the son of Tydeus\nfrom over his huge shield kept aiming continually at Ajax\u2019s neck with the point of his spear, and the Achaeans\nalarmed for his safety bade them leave off fighting and divide the prize between them. Achilles then gave the great\nsword to the son of Tydeus, with its scabbard, and the leathern belt with which to hang it.\nAchilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion had erewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles\nhad slain him and carried it off in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and said among the Argives, \u201cStand\nforward, you who would essay this contest. He who wins it will have a store of iron that will last him five years as\nthey go rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a town his shepherd or ploughman will not have to make a\njourney to buy iron, for he will have a stock of it on his own premises.\u201d\nThen uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajax son of Telamon and noble Epeus. They\nstood up one after the other and Epeus took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which set all the Achae-\nans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race of Mars. Ajax son of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit\nbeyond any mark that had been made yet, but when mighty Polypoetes took the quoit he hurled it as though it had\nbeen a stockman\u2019s stick which he sends flying about among his cattle when he is driving them, so far did his throw\nout-distance those of the others. All who saw it roared applause, and his comrades carried the prize for him and set\nit on board his ship.\nAchilles next offered a prize of iron for archery\u2014ten double-edged axes and ten with single eddies: he set up\na ship\u2019s mast, some way off upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to it by the foot; this was what they\nwere to aim at. \u201cWhoever,\u201d he said, \u201ccan hit the pigeon shall have all the axes and take them away with him; he who\nhits the string without hitting the bird will have taken a worse aim and shall have the single-edged axes.\u201d\nThen uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire of Idomeneus rose also, They cast lots in a bronze\nhelmet and the lot of Teucer fell first. He let fly with his arrow forthwith, but he did not promise hecatombs of\nfirstling lambs to King Apollo, and missed his bird, for Apollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string with which the\nbird was tied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string clean through so that it hung down towards the ground, while\nthe bird flew up into the sky, and the Achaeans shouted applause. Meriones, who had his arrow ready while Teucer\nwas aiming, snatched the bow out of his hand, and at once promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling\nlambs to Apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under the clouds, he hit her in the middle of the\nwing as she was circling upwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and fixed itself in the ground at Meriones\u2019\nfeet, but the bird perched on the ship\u2019s mast hanging her head and with all her feathers drooping; the life went out\nof her, and she fell heavily from the mast. Meriones, therefore, took all ten double-edged axes, while Teucer bore off\nthe single-edged ones to his ships.\nThen the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had never been on the fire; it was worth an ox,\nand was chased with a pattern of flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up\u2014to wit the son of Atreus, king\nof men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwart squire of Idomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, \u201cSon of Atreus, we\nknow how far you excel all others both in power and in throwing the javelin; take the cauldron back with you to\nyour ships, but if it so please you, let us give the spear to Meriones; this at least is what I should myself wish.\u201d\nKing Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones, and handed the goodly cauldron to\nTalthybius his esquire.\nBook XXIV\nTHE assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to his own ship. There they made ready\ntheir supper, and then bethought them of the blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still wept for thinking of his dear\n229 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ncomrade, and sleep, before whom all things bow, could take no hold upon him. This way and that did he turn as\nhe yearned after the might and manfulness of Patroclus; he thought of all they had done together, and all they had\ngone through both on the field of battle and on the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt on these things he wept\nbitterly and lay now on his side, now on his back, and now face downwards, till at last he rose and went out as one\ndistraught to wander upon the seashore. Then, when he saw dawn breaking over beach and sea, he yoked his horses\nto his chariot, and bound the body of Hector behind it that he might drag it about. Thrice did he drag it round the\ntomb of the son of Menoetius, and then went back into his tent, leaving the body on the ground full length and with\nits face downwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to be disfigured, for he pitied the man, dead though he now was;\ntherefore he shielded him with his golden aegis continually, that he might take no hurt while Achilles was dragging\nhim.\nThus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but the blessed gods looked down in pity from\nheaven, and urged Mercury, slayer of Argus, to steal the body. All were of this mind save only Juno, Neptune, and\nJove\u2019s grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in the hate which they had ever borne towards Ilius with Priam and his\npeople; for they forgave not the wrong done them by Alexandrus in disdaining the goddesses who came to him\nwhen he was in his sheepyards, and preferring her who had offered him a wanton to his ruin.\nWhen, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come, Phoebus Apollo spoke among the immortals\nsaying, \u201cYou gods ought to be ashamed of yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did not Hector burn you\nthigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? And now dare you not rescue even his dead body, for his wife to\nlook upon, with his mother and child, his father Priam, and his people, who would forthwith commit him to the\nflames, and give him his due funeral rites? So, then, you would all be on the side of mad Achilles, who knows nei-\nther right nor ruth? He is like some savage lion that in the pride of his great strength and daring springs upon men\u2019s\nflocks and gorges on them. Even so has Achilles flung aside all pity, and all that conscience which at once so greatly\nbanes yet greatly boons him that will heed it. man may lose one far dearer than Achilles has lost\u2014a son, it may be,\nor a brother born from his own mother\u2019s womb; yet when he has mourned him and wept over him he will let him\nbide, for it takes much sorrow to kill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he has slain noble Hector, drags him behind\nhis chariot round the tomb of his comrade. It were better of him, and for him, that he should not do so, for brave\nthough he be we gods may take it ill that he should vent his fury upon dead clay.\u201d\nJuno spoke up in a rage. \u201cThis were well,\u201d she cried, \u201cO lord of the silver bow, if you would give like honour to\nHector and to Achilles; but Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman\u2019s breast, whereas Achilles is the offspring of\na goddess whom I myself reared and brought up. I married her to Peleus, who is above measure dear to the immor-\ntals; you gods came all of you to her wedding; you feasted along with them yourself and brought your lyre\u2014false,\nand fond of low company, that you have ever been.\u201d\nThen said Jove, \u201cJuno, be not so bitter. Their honour shall not be equal, but of all that dwell in Ilius, Hector was\ndearest to the gods, as also to myself, for his offerings never failed me. Never was my altar stinted of its dues, nor\nof the drink-offerings and savour of sacrifice which we claim of right. I shall therefore permit the body of mighty\nHector to be stolen; and yet this may hardly be without Achilles coming to know it, for his mother keeps night and\nday beside him. Let some one of you, therefore, send Thetis to me, and I will impart my counsel to her, namely that\nAchilles is to accept a ransom from Priam, and give up the body.\u201d\nOn this Iris fleet as the wind went forth to carry his message. Down she plunged into the dark sea midway\nbetween Samos and rocky Imbrus; the waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into the bottom as the\nlead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carry death to fishes. She found Thetis sitting in a great cave with the\nother sea-goddesses gathered round her; there she sat in the midst of them weeping for her noble son who was to\nfall far from his own land, on the rich plains of Troy. Iris went up to her and said, \u201cRise Thetis; Jove, whose counsels\nfail not, bids you come to him.\u201d And Thetis answered, \u201cWhy does the mighty god so bid me? I am in great grief,\nand shrink from going in and out among the immortals. Still, I will go, and the word that he may speak shall not be\nspoken in vain.\u201d\nThe goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe more sombre, and went forth with fleet Iris\nleading the way before her. The waves of the sea opened them a path, and when they reached the shore they flew up\ninto the heavens, where they found the all-seeing son of Saturn with the blessed gods that live for ever assembled\nnear him. Minerva gave up her seat to her, and she sat down by the side of father Jove. Juno then placed a fair gold-\nen cup in her hand, and spoke to her in words of comfort, whereon Thetis drank and gave her back the cup; and the\nsire of gods and men was the first to speak.\n\u201cSo, goddess,\u201d said he, \u201cfor all your sorrow, and the grief that I well know reigns ever in your heart, you have\ncome hither to Olympus, and I will tell you why I have sent for you. This nine days past the immortals have been\nquarrelling about Achilles waster of cities and the body of Hector. The gods would have Mercury slayer of Argus\nsteal the body, but in furtherance of our peace and amity henceforward, I will concede such honour to your son as\nI will now tell you. Go, then, to the host and lay these commands upon him; say that the gods are angry with him,\n230 The Iliad\nand that I am myself more angry than them all, in that he keeps Hector at the ships and will not give him up. He\nmay thus fear me and let the body go. At the same time I will send Iris to great Priam to bid him go to the ships of\nthe Achaeans, and ransom his son, taking with him such gifts for Achilles as may give him satisfaction.\nSilver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith down she darted from the topmost summits of\nOlympus. She went to her son\u2019s tents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his trusty comrades round him\nwere busy preparing their morning meal, for which they had killed a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down\nbeside him and caressed him with her hand saying, \u201cMy son, how long will you keep on thus grieving and making\nmoan? You are gnawing at your own heart, and think neither of food nor of woman\u2019s embraces; and yet these too\nwere well, for you have no long time to live, and death with the strong hand of fate are already close beside you.\nNow, therefore, heed what I say, for I come as a messenger from Jove; he says that the gods are angry with you, and\nhimself more angry than them all, in that you keep Hector at the ships and will not give him up. Therefore let him\ngo, and accept a ransom for his body.\u201d\nAnd Achilles answered, \u201cSo be it. If Olympian Jove of his own motion thus commands me, let him that brings\nthe ransom bear the body away.\u201d\nThus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discourse with one another. Meanwhile the son of\nSaturn sent Iris to the strong city of Ilius. \u201cGo,\u201d said he, \u201cfleet Iris, from the mansions of Olympus, and tell King\nPriam in Ilius, that he is to go to the ships of the Achaeans and free the body of his dear son. He is to take such gifts\nwith him as shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and he is to go alone, with no other Trojan, save only some honoured\nservant who may drive his mules and waggon, and bring back the body of him whom noble Achilles has slain. Let\nhim have no thought nor fear of death in his heart, for we will send the slayer of Argus to escort him, and bring him\nwithin the tent of Achilles. Achilles will not kill him nor let another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin\nnot, and he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.\u201d\nOn this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her message. She went to Priam\u2019s house, and found weeping\nand lamentation therein. His sons were seated round their father in the outer courtyard, and their raiment was wet\nwith tears: the old man sat in the midst of them with his mantle wrapped close about his body, and his head and\nneck all covered with the filth which he had clutched as he lay grovelling in the mire. His daughters and his sons\u2019\nwives went wailing about the house, as they thought of the many and brave men who lay dead, slain by the Argives.\nThe messenger of Jove stood by Priam and spoke softly to him, but fear fell upon him as she did so. \u201cTake heart,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cPriam offspring of Dardanus, take heart and fear not. I bring no evil tidings, but am minded well towards\nyou. I come as a messenger from Jove, who though he be not near, takes thought for you and pities you. The lord of\nOlympus bids you go and ransom noble Hector, and take with you such gifts as shall give satisfaction to Achilles.\nYou are to go alone, with no Trojan, save only some honoured servant who may drive your mules and waggon, and\nbring back to the city the body of him whom noble Achilles has slain. You are to have no thought, nor fear of death,\nfor Jove will send the slayer of Argus to escort you. When he has brought you within Achilles\u2019 tent, Achilles will not\nkill you nor let another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and he will entreat a suppliant with all\nhonourable courtesy.\u201d\nIris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told his sons to get a mule-waggon ready, and to make\nthe body of the waggon fast upon the top of its bed. Then he went down into his fragrant store-room, high-vaulted,\nand made of cedar-wood, where his many treasures were kept, and he called Hecuba his wife. \u201cWife,\u201d said he, \u201ca\nmessenger has come to me from Olympus, and has told me to go to the ships of the Achaeans to ransom my dear\nson, taking with me such gifts as shall give satisfaction to Achilles. What think you of this matter? for my own part I\nam greatly moved to pass through the of the Achaeans and go to their ships.\u201d\nHis wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, \u201cAlas, what has become of that judgement for which you have\nbeen ever famous both among strangers and your own people? How can you venture alone to the ships of the\nAchaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain so many of your brave sons? You must have iron courage,\nfor if the cruel savage sees you and lays hold on you, he will know neither respect nor pity. Let us then weep Hector\nfrom afar here in our own house, for when I gave him birth the threads of overruling fate were spun for him that\ndogs should eat his flesh far from his parents, in the house of that terrible man on whose liver I would fain fasten\nand devour it. Thus would I avenge my son, who showed no cowardice when Achilles slew him, and thought nei-\nther of Right nor of avoiding battle as he stood in defence of Trojan men and Trojan women.\u201d\nThen Priam said, \u201cI would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as a bird of ill omen in my house, for you will\nnot move me. Had it been some mortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who divines from sacrifice\u2014I\nshould have deemed him false and have given him no heed; but now I have heard the goddess and seen her face to\nface, therefore I will go and her saying shall not be in vain. If it be my fate to die at the ships of the Achaeans even so\nwould I have it; let Achilles slay me, if I may but first have taken my son in my arms and mourned him to my heart\u2019s\ncomforting.\u201d\nSo saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve goodly vestments. He took also twelve cloaks of\n231 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nsingle fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. He weighed out ten talents of gold, and\nbrought moreover two burnished tripods, four cauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had given\nhim when he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious, but he grudged not even this, so eager was\nhe to ransom the body of his son. Then he chased all the Trojans from the court and rebuked them with words of\nanger. \u201cOut,\u201d he cried, \u201cshame and disgrace to me that you are. Have you no grief in your own homes that you are\ncome to plague me here? Is it a small thing, think you, that the son of Saturn has sent this sorrow upon me, to lose\nthe bravest of my sons? Nay, you shall prove it in person, for now he is gone the Achaeans will have easier work in\nkilling you. As for me, let me go down within the house of Hades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking and wasting of\nthe city.\u201d\nHe drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the old man sped them. Then he called to his sons,\nupbraiding Helenus, Paris, noble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the loud battle-cry, Deiphobus, Hip-\npothous, and Dius. These nine did the old man call near him. \u201cCome to me at once,\u201d he cried, \u201cworthless sons who\ndo me shame; would that you had all been killed at the ships rather than Hector. Miserable man that I am, I have\nhad the bravest sons in all Troy\u2014noble Nestor, Troilus the dauntless charioteer, and Hector who was a god among\nmen, so that one would have thought he was son to an immortal\u2014yet there is not one of them left. Mars has slain\nthem and those of whom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and light of foot, heroes of the dance, robbers of\nlambs and kids from your own people, why do you not get a waggon ready for me at once, and put all these things\nupon it that I may set out on my way?\u201d\nThus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father. They brought out a strong mule-waggon, newly\nmade, and set the body of the waggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from the peg on which it hung, a\nyoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it and rings for the reins to go through. Then they brought a yoke-band\neleven cubits long, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it on at the far end of the pole, and put the ring over\nthe upright pin making it fast with three turns of the band on either side the knob, and bending the thong of the\nyoke beneath it. This done, they brought from the store-chamber the rich ransom that was to purchase the body of\nHector, and they set it all orderly on the waggon; then they yoked the strong harness-mules which the Mysians had\non a time given as a goodly present to Priam; but for Priam himself they yoked horses which the old king had bred,\nand kept for own use.\nThus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of their cars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to\nthem all sorrowful, with a golden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make a drink-offering before\nthey set out. She stood in front of the horses and said, \u201cTake this, make a drink-offering to father Jove, and since\nyou are minded to go to the ships in spite of me, pray that you may come safely back from the hands of your en-\nemies. Pray to the son of Saturn lord of the whirlwind, who sits on Ida and looks down over all Troy, pray him to\nsend his swift messenger on your right hand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to him of all birds,\nthat you may see it with your own eyes and trust it as you go forth to the ships of the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove will\nnot send you this messenger, however set upon it you may be, I would not have you go to the ships of the Argives.\u201d\nAnd Priam answered, \u201cWife, I will do as you desire me; it is well to lift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may\nhave mercy upon me.\u201d\nWith this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over his hands, and the woman came, bear-\ning the water in a bowl. He washed his hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the drink-offering and\nprayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and turning his eyes to heaven. \u201cFather Jove,\u201d he said, \u201cthat rulest\nfrom Ida, most glorious and most great, grant that I may be received kindly and compassionately in the tents of\nAchilles; and send your swift messenger upon my right hand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to\nyou of all birds, that I may see it with my own eyes and trust it as I go forth to the ships of the Danaans.\u201d\nSo did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer. Forthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring por-\ntent of all birds that fly, the dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. His wings were spread abroad on either\nside as wide as the well-made and well-bolted door of a rich man\u2019s chamber. He came to them flying over the city\nupon their right hands, and when they saw him they were glad and their hearts took comfort within them. The old\nman made haste to mount his chariot, and drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse\nof the outer court. Before him went the mules drawing the four-wheeled waggon, and driven by wise Idaeus; behind\nthese were the horses, which the old man lashed with his whip and drove swiftly through the city, while his friends\nfollowed after, wailing and lamenting for him as though he were on his road to death. As soon as they had come\ndown from the city and had reached the plain, his sons and sons-in-law who had followed him went back to Ilius.\nBut Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not escape the ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked\ndown upon the old man and pitied him; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said, \u201cMercury, for it is you who are\nthe most disposed to escort men on their way, and to hear those whom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam to\nthe ships of the Achaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see him nor take note of him until he reach the son of\nPeleus.\u201d\n232 The Iliad\nThus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as he was told. Forthwith he bound on his\nglittering golden sandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea; he took the wand with which he\nseals men\u2019s eyes in sleep, or wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand till he came to Troy and to\nthe Hellespont. To look at, he was like a young man of noble birth in the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the\ndown just coming upon his face.\nNow when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of Ilius, they stayed their mules and horses that\nthey might drink in the river, for the shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaeus saw Mercury standing\nnear them he said to Priam, \u201cTake heed, descendant of Dardanus; here is matter which demands consideration. I\nsee a man who I think will presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses, or at least embrace his knees and im-\nplore him to take compassion upon us?\nWhen he heard this the old man\u2019s heart failed him, and he was in great fear; he stayed where he was as one\ndazed, and the hair stood on end over his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him and took him\nby the hand, saying, \u201cWhither, father, are you thus driving your mules and horses in the dead of night when other\nmen are asleep? Are you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hard by you, so cruel and relentless? Should some\none of them see you bearing so much treasure through the darkness of the flying night, what would not your state\nthen be? You are no longer young, and he who is with you is too old to protect you from those who would attack\nyou. For myself, I will do you no harm, and I will defend you from any one else, for you remind me of my own\nfather.\u201d\nAnd Priam answered, \u201cIt is indeed as you say, my dear son; nevertheless some god has held his hand over me, in\nthat he has sent such a wayfarer as yourself to meet me so Opportunely; you are so comely in mien and figure, and\nyour judgement is so excellent that you must come of blessed parents.\u201d\nThen said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \u201cSir, all that you have said is right; but tell me and tell me\ntrue, are you taking this rich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may be safe, or are you all leaving strong\nIlius in dismay now that your son has fallen who was the bravest man among you and was never lacking in battle\nwith the Achaeans?\u201d\nAnd Priam said, \u201cWo are you, my friend, and who are your parents, that you speak so truly about the fate of my\nunhappy son?\u201d\nThe slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, \u201cSir, you would prove me, that you question me about\nnoble Hector. Many a time have I set eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the Argives to their ships and\nputting them to the sword. We stood still and marvelled, for Achilles in his anger with the son of Atreus suffered us\nnot to fight. I am his squire, and came with him in the same ship. I am a Myrmidon, and my father\u2019s name is Polyc-\ntor: he is a rich man and about as old as you are; he has six sons besides myself, and I am the seventh. We cast lots,\nand it fell upon me to sail hither with Achilles. I am now come from the ships on to the plain, for with daybreak\nthe Achaeans will set battle in array about the city. They chafe at doing nothing, and are so eager that their princes\ncannot hold them back.\u201d\nThen answered Priam, \u201cIf you are indeed the squire of Achilles son of Peleus, tell me now the Whole truth. Is\nmy son still at the ships, or has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to his hounds?\u201d\n\u201cSir,\u201d replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \u201cneither hounds nor vultures have yet devoured him;\nhe is still just lying at the tents by the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve days that he has lain there, his\nflesh is not wasted nor have the worms eaten him although they feed on warriors. At daybreak Achilles drags him\ncruelly round the sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does him no hurt. You should come yourself and see how he\nlies fresh as dew, with the blood all washed away, and his wounds every one of them closed though many pierced\nhim with their spears. Such care have the blessed gods taken of your brave son, for he was dear to them beyond all\nmeasure.\u201d\nThe old man was comforted as he heard him and said, \u201cMy son, see what a good thing it is to have made due of-\nferings to the immortals; for as sure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that hold Olympus, and now\nthey requite it to him even in death. Accept therefore at my hands this goodly chalice; guard me and with heaven\u2019s\nhelp guide me till I come to the tent of the son of Peleus.\u201d\nThen answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \u201cSir, you are tempting me and playing upon my youth,\nbut you shall not move me, for you are offering me presents without the knowledge of Achilles whom I fear and\nhold it great guiltless to defraud, lest some evil presently befall me; but as your guide I would go with you even to\nArgos itself, and would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land, that no one should attack you through mak-\ning light of him who was with you.\u201d\nThe bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and seizing the whip and reins he breathed fresh spirit\ninto the mules and horses. When they reached the trench and the wall that was before the ships, those who were on\nguard had just been getting their suppers, and the slayer of Argus threw them all into a deep sleep. Then he drew\nback the bolts to open the gates, and took Priam inside with the treasure he had upon his waggon. Ere long they\n233 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ncame to the lofty dwelling of the son of Peleus for which the Myrmidons had cut pine and which they had built for\ntheir king; when they had built it they thatched it with coarse tussock-grass which they had mown out on the plain,\nand all round it they made a large courtyard, which was fenced with stakes set close together. The gate was barred\nwith a single bolt of pine which it took three men to force into its place, and three to draw back so as to open the\ngate, but Achilles could draw it by himself. Mercury opened the gate for the old man, and brought in the treasure\nthat he was taking with him for the son of Peleus. Then he sprang from the chariot on to the ground and said, \u201cSir,\nit is I, immortal Mercury, that am come with you, for my father sent me to escort you. I will now leave you, and will\nnot enter into the presence of Achilles, for it might anger him that a god should befriend mortal men thus openly.\nGo you within, and embrace the knees of the son of Peleus: beseech him by his father, his lovely mother, and his\nson; thus you may move him.\u201d\nWith these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprang from his chariot to the ground, leaving\nIdaeus where he was, in charge of the mules and horses. The old man went straight into the house where Achilles,\nloved of the gods, was sitting. There he found him with his men seated at a distance from him: only two, the hero\nAutomedon, and Alcimus of the race of Mars, were busy in attendance about his person, for he had but just done\neating and drinking, and the table was still there. King Priam entered without their seeing him, and going right up\nto Achilles he clasped his knees and kissed the dread murderous hands that had slain so many of his sons.\nAs when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have killed some one in his own country, and must\nfly to a great man\u2019s protection in a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even so did Achilles marvel as he\nbeheld Priam. The others looked one to another and marvelled also, but Priam besought Achilles saying, \u201cThink of\nyour father, O Achilles like unto the gods, who is such even as I am, on the sad threshold of old age. It may be that\nthose who dwell near him harass him, and there is none to keep war and ruin from him. Yet when he hears of you\nbeing still alive, he is glad, and his days are full of hope that he shall see his dear son come home to him from Troy;\nbut I, wretched man that I am, had the bravest in all Troy for my sons, and there is not one of them left. I had fifty\nsons when the Achaeans came here; nineteen of them were from a single womb, and the others were borne to me by\nthe women of my household. The greater part of them has fierce Mars laid low, and Hector, him who was alone left,\nhim who was the guardian of the city and ourselves, him have you lately slain; therefore I am now come to the ships\nof the Achaeans to ransom his body from you with a great ransom. Fear, O Achilles, the wrath of heaven; think on\nyour own father and have compassion upon me, who am the more pitiable, for I have steeled myself as no man yet\nhas ever steeled himself before me, and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slew my son.\u201d\nThus spoke Priam, and the heart of Achilles yearned as he bethought him of his father. He took the old man\u2019s hand\nand moved him gently away. The two wept bitterly\u2014Priam, as he lay at Achilles\u2019 feet, weeping for Hector, and Achilles\nnow for his father and now for Patroclous, till the house was filled with their lamentation. But when Achilles was now\nsated with grief and had unburthened the bitterness of his sorrow, he left his seat and raised the old man by the hand,\nin pity for his white hair and beard; then he said, \u201cUnhappy man, you have indeed been greatly daring; how could you\nventure to come alone to the ships of the Achaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain so many of your brave\nsons? You must have iron courage: sit now upon this seat, and for all our grief we will hide our sorrows in our hearts,\nfor weeping will not avail us. The immortals know no care, yet the lot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor\nof Jove\u2019s palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for whom Jove\nthe lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Jove\nsends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the\nworld, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men. Even so did it befall Pele-\nus; the gods endowed him with all good things from his birth upwards, for he reigned over the Myrmidons excelling\nall men in prosperity and wealth, and mortal though he was they gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on him\ntoo did heaven send misfortune, for there is no race of royal children born to him in his house, save one son who is\ndoomed to die all untimely; nor may I take care of him now that he is growing old, for I must stay here at Troy to be\nthe bane of you and your children. And you too, O Priam, I have heard that you were aforetime happy. They say that\nin wealth and plenitude of offspring you surpassed all that is in Lesbos, the realm of Makar to the northward, Phrygia\nthat is more inland, and those that dwell upon the great Hellespont; but from the day when the dwellers in heaven sent\nthis evil upon you, war and slaughter have been about your city continually. Bear up against it, and let there be some\nintervals in your sorrow. Mourn as you may for your brave son, you will take nothing by it. You cannot raise him from\nthe dead, ere you do so yet another sorrow shall befall you.\u201d\nAnd Priam answered, \u201cO king, bid me not be seated, while Hector is still lying uncared for in your tents, but\naccept the great ransom which I have brought you, and give him to me at once that I may look upon him. May you\nprosper with the ransom and reach your own land in safety, seeing that you have suffered me to live and to look\nupon the light of the sun.\u201d\nAchilles looked at him sternly and said, \u201cVex me, sir, no longer; I am of myself minded to give up the body of\nHector. My mother, daughter of the old man of the sea, came to me from Jove to bid me deliver it to you. Moreover\n234 The Iliad\nI know well, O Priam, and you cannot hide it, that some god has brought you to the ships of the Achaeans, for else,\nno man however strong and in his prime would dare to come to our host; he could neither pass our guard unseen,\nnor draw the bolt of my gates thus easily; therefore, provoke me no further, lest I sin against the word of Jove, and\nsuffer you not, suppliant though you are, within my tents.\u201d\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus sprang like a lion through the door of his house,\nnot alone, but with him went his two squires Automedon and Alcimus who were closer to him than any others of\nhis comrades now that Patroclus was no more. These unyoked the horses and mules, and bade Priam\u2019s herald and\nattendant be seated within the house. They lifted the ransom for Hector\u2019s body from the waggon. but they left two\nmantles and a goodly shirt, that Achilles might wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home. Then he\ncalled to his servants and ordered them to wash the body and anoint it, but he first took it to a place where Priam\nshould not see it, lest if he did so, he should break out in the bitterness of his grief, and enrage Achilles, who might\nthen kill him and sin against the word of Jove. When the servants had washed the body and anointed it, and had\nwrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, Achilles himself lifted it on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on the\nwaggon. He cried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his dear comrade, \u201cBe not angry with me, Patroclus,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cif you hear even in the house of Hades that I have given Hector to his father for a ransom. It has been no\nunworthy one, and I will share it equitably with you.\u201d\nAchilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the richly inlaid seat from which he had risen, by\nthe wall that was at right angles to the one against which Priam was sitting. \u201cSir,\u201d he said, \u201cyour son is now laid\nupon his bier and is ransomed according to desire; you shall look upon him when you him away at daybreak; for\nthe present let us prepare our supper. Even lovely Niobe had to think about eating, though her twelve children\u2014six\ndaughters and six lusty sons\u2014had been all slain in her house. Apollo killed the sons with arrows from his silver\nbow, to punish Niobe, and Diana slew the daughters, because Niobe had vaunted herself against Leto; she said Leto\nhad borne two children only, whereas she had herself borne many\u2014whereon the two killed the many. Nine days\ndid they lie weltering, and there was none to bury them, for the son of Saturn turned the people into stone; but on\nthe tenth day the gods in heaven themselves buried them, and Niobe then took food, being worn out with weeping.\nThey say that somewhere among the rocks on the mountain pastures of Sipylus, where the nymphs live that haunt\nthe river Achelous, there, they say, she lives in stone and still nurses the sorrows sent upon her by the hand of heav-\nen. Therefore, noble sir, let us two now take food; you can weep for your dear son hereafter as you are bearing him\nback to Ilius\u2014and many a tear will he cost you.\u201d\nWith this Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of silvery whiteness, which his followers skinned and\nmade ready all in due order. They cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spitted them, and drew them off\nagain when they were well roasted. Automedon brought bread in fair baskets and served it round the table, while\nAchilles dealt out the meat, and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them. As soon as they had\nhad enough to eat and drink, Priam, descendant of Dardanus, marvelled at the strength and beauty of Achilles for\nhe was as a god to see, and Achilles marvelled at Priam as he listened to him and looked upon his noble presence.\nWhen they had gazed their fill Priam spoke first. \u201cAnd now, O king,\u201d he said, \u201ctake me to my couch that we may lie\ndown and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep. Never once have my eyes been closed from the day your hands took the\nlife of my son; I have grovelled without ceasing in the mire of my stable-yard, making moan and brooding over my\ncountless sorrows. Now, moreover, I have eaten bread and drunk wine; hitherto I have tasted nothing.\u201d\nAs he spoke Achilles told his men and the women-servants to set beds in the room that was in the gatehouse,\nand make them with good red rugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Priam and\nIdaeus to wear. So the maids went out carrying a torch and got the two beds ready in all haste. Then Achilles said\nlaughingly to Priam, \u201cDear sir, you shall lie outside, lest some counsellor of those who in due course keep coming to\nadvise with me should see you here in the darkness of the flying night, and tell it to Agamemnon. This might cause\ndelay in the delivery of the body. And now tell me and tell me true, for how many days would you celebrate the\nfuneral rites of noble Hector? Tell me, that I may hold aloof from war and restrain the host.\u201d\nAnd Priam answered, \u201cSince, then, you suffer me to bury my noble son with all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and\nI shall be grateful. You know how we are pent up within our city; it is far for us to fetch wood from the mountain,\nand the people live in fear. Nine days, therefore, will we mourn Hector in my house; on the tenth day we will bury\nhim and there shall be a public feast in his honour; on the eleventh we will build a mound over his ashes, and on\nthe twelfth, if there be need, we will fight.\u201d\nAnd Achilles answered, \u201cAll, King Priam, shall be as you have said. I will stay our fighting for as long a time as\nyou have named.\u201d\nAs he spoke he laid his hand on the old man\u2019s right wrist, in token that he should have no fear; thus then did\nPriam and his attendant sleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, while Achilles lay in an inner room of the\nhouse, with fair Briseis by his side.\nAnd now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the livelong night, but upon Mercury alone, the\n235 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nbringer of good luck, sleep could take no hold for he was thinking all the time how to get King Priam away from the\nships without his being seen by the strong force of sentinels. He hovered therefore over Priam\u2019s head and said, \u201cSir,\nnow that Achilles has spared your life, you seem to have no fear about sleeping in the thick of your foes. You have\npaid a great ransom, and have received the body of your son; were you still alive and a prisoner the sons whom you\nhave left at home would have to give three times as much to free you; and so it would be if Agamemnon and the\nother Achaeans were to know of your being here.\u201d\nWhen he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant. Mercury then yoked their horses and mules,\nand drove them quickly through the host so that no man perceived them. When they came to the ford of eddy-\ning Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Mercury went back to high Olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began\nto break over all the land. Priam and Idaeus then drove on toward the city lamenting and making moan, and the\nmules drew the body of Hector. No one neither man nor woman saw them, till Cassandra, fair as golden Venus\nstanding on Pergamus, caught sight of her dear father in his chariot, and his servant that was the city\u2019s herald with\nhim. Then she saw him that was lying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, and with a loud cry she went about the\ncity saying, \u201cCome hither Trojans, men and women, and look on Hector; if ever you rejoiced to see him coming\nfrom battle when he was alive, look now on him that was the glory of our city and all our people.\u201d\nAt this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great a sorrow had possessed them. Hard by the gates\nthey met Priam as he was bringing in the body. Hector\u2019s wife and his mother were the first to mourn him: they flew\ntowards the waggon and laid their hands upon his head, while the crowd stood weeping round them. They would\nhave stayed before the gates, weeping and lamenting the livelong day to the going down of the sun, had not Priam\nspoken to them from the chariot and said, \u201cMake way for the mules to pass you. Afterwards when I have taken the\nbody home you shall have your fill of weeping.\u201d\nOn this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon. When they had borne the body within the\nhouse they laid it upon a bed and seated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the women joined in the sad\nmusic of their lament. Foremost among them all Andromache led their wailing as she clasped the head of mighty\nHector in her embrace. \u201cHusband,\u201d she cried, \u201cyou have died young, and leave me in your house a widow; he of\nwhom we are the ill-starred parents is still a mere child, and I fear he may not reach manhood. Ere he can do so\nour city will be razed and overthrown, for you who watched over it are no more \u2014 you who were its saviour, the\nguardian of our wives and children. Our women will be carried away captives to the ships, and I among them; while\nyou, my child, who will be with me will be put to some unseemly tasks, working for a cruel master. Or, may be,\nsome Achaean will hurl you (O miserable death) from our walls, to avenge some brother, son, or father whom Hec-\ntor slew; many of them have indeed bitten the dust at his hands, for your father\u2019s hand in battle was no light one.\nTherefore do the people mourn him. You have left, O Hector, sorrow unutterable to your parents, and my own grief\nis greatest of all, for you did not stretch forth your arms and embrace me as you lay dying, nor say to me any words\nthat might have lived with me in my tears night and day for evermore.\u201d\nBitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament. Hecuba in her turn took up the strains of\nwoe. \u201cHector,\u201d she cried, \u201cdearest to me of all my children. So long as you were alive the gods loved you well, and\neven in death they have not been utterly unmindful of you; for when Achilles took any other of my sons, he would\nsell him beyond the seas, to Samos Imbrus or rugged Lemnos; and when he had slain you too with his sword, many\na time did he drag you round the sepulchre of his comrade\u2014 though this could not give him life\u2014yet here you lie\nall fresh as dew, and comely as one whom Apollo has slain with his painless shafts.\u201d\nThus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and then Helen for a third time took up the strain\nof lamentation. \u201cHector,\u201d said she, \u201cdearest of all my brothers-in-law-for I am wife to Alexandrus who brought me\nhither to Troy\u2014would that I had died ere he did so\u2014twenty years are come and gone since I left my home and\ncame from over the sea, but I have never heard one word of insult or unkindness from you. When another would\nchide with me, as it might be one of your brothers or sisters or of your brothers\u2019 wives, or my mother-in-law\u2014for\nPriam was as kind to me as though he were my own father\u2014you would rebuke and check them with words of gen-\ntleness and goodwill. Therefore my tears flow both for you and for my unhappy self, for there is no one else in Troy\nwho is kind to me, but all shrink and shudder as they go by me.\u201d\nShe wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round her joined in her lament. Then King Priam spoke\nto them saying, \u201cBring wood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of the Argives, for Achilles when he\ndismissed me from the ships gave me his word that they should not attack us until the morning of the twelfth day.\u201d\nForthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together before the city. Nine days long did they\nbring in great heaps wood, and on the morning of the tenth day with many tears they took trave Hector forth, laid\nhis dead body upon the summit of the pile, and set the fire thereto. Then when the child of morning rosy-fingered\ndawn appeared on the eleventh day, the people again assembled, round the pyre of mighty Hector. When they were\ngot together, they first quenched the fire with wine wherever it was burning, and then his brothers and comrades\nwith many a bitter tear gathered his white bones, wrapped them in soft robes of purple, and laid them in a golden\n236 The Iliad\nurn, which they placed in a grave and covered over with large stones set close together. Then they built a barrow\nhurriedly over it keeping guard on every side lest the Achaeans should attack them before they had finished. When\nthey had heaped up the barrow they went back again into the city, and being well assembled they held high feast in\nthe house of Priam their king.\nThus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector tamer of horses.\nThe odyssey\nLicense: Public Domain\nHomer, translated by Samuel Butler\nBook I\nTELL ME, O MUSE, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town\nof Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted;\nmoreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he\nmight he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god\nHyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, O daughter of\nJove, from whatsoever source you may know them.\nSo now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home except Ulysses, and he, though he\nwas longing to return to his wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into a large\ncave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a time when the gods settled that he should go\nback to Ithaca; even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not yet over; nevertheless\nall the gods had now begun to pity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let\nhim get home.\nNow Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world\u2019s end, and lie in two halves, the one looking\nWest and the other East. He had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying himself at\nhis festival; but the other gods met in the house of Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that\nmoment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon\u2019s son Orestes; so he said to the other\ngods:\n\u201cSee now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus;\nhe must needs make love to Agamemnon\u2019s wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew it would\nbe the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be\nsure to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him this in all good will but he\nwould not listen, and now he has paid for everything in full.\u201d\nThen Minerva said, \u201cFather, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served Aegisthus right, and so it would any one else\nwho does as he did; but Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart bleeds, when I think of his\nsufferings in that lonely sea-girt island, far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered with forest,\nin the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom\nof the ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold\nof poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, so that he\nis tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take\nno heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice? Why\nthen should you keep on being so angry with him?\u201d\nAnd Jove said, \u201cMy child, what are you talking about? How can I forget Ulysses than whom there is no more\ncapable man on earth, nor more liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear in mind,\nhowever, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes.\nPolyphemus is son to Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore though he will\nnot kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by preventing him from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together\nand see how we can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified, for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand\nout against us.\u201d\nAnd Minerva said, \u201cFather, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the gods now mean that Ulysses should get\nhome, we should first send Mercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and that\nhe is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to put heart into Ulysses\u2019 son Telemachus; I will embolden him\nto call the Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who persist in eating up any\nnumber of his sheep and oxen; I will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear anything about\nthe return of his dear father\u2014for this will make people speak well of him.\u201d\nSo saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable, with which she can fly like the wind over\nland or sea; she grasped the redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith she quells\n237 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthe ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon\nforthwith she was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses\u2019 house, disguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians,\nand she held a bronze spear in her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which they\nhad killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to\nwait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the tables with wet spong-\nes and laying them out again, and some cutting up great quantities of meat.\nTelemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily among the suitors thinking about\nhis brave father, and how he would send them flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again and be\nhonoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to\nthe gate, for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her right hand in his own,\nand bade her give him her spear. \u201cWelcome,\u201d said he, \u201cto our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall\ntell us what you have come for.\u201d\nHe led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were within he took her spear and set it\nin the spear\u2014stand against a strong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father, and he\nconducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her\nfeet, and he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she might not be annoyed while eating\nby their noise and insolence, and that he might ask her more freely about his father.\nA maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for them to\nwash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them\nmany good things of what there was in the house, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set\ncups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine and poured it out for them.\nThen the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats. Forthwith men servants poured water\nover their hands, maids went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water,\nand they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\ndrink they wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet, so a servant brought\na lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing\nTelemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers that no man might hear.\n\u201cI hope, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you will not be offended with what I am going to say. Singing comes cheap to those\nwho do not pay for it, and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some wilderness or grinding\nto powder in the surf. If these men were to see my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather\nthan a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he, alas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do\nsometimes say that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now, sir, tell me and\ntell me true, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you\ncame in, how your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared themselves to be\u2014for you cannot\nhave come by land. Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in\nmy father\u2019s time? In the old days we had many visitors for my father went about much himself.\u201d\nAnd Minerva answered, \u201cI will tell you truly and particularly all about it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and\nI am King of the Taphians. I have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being\nbound for Temesa with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open\ncountry away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron under the wooded mountain Neritum. Our fathers were\nfriends before us, as old Laertes will tell you, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes to\ntown now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him and get his dinner\nfor him, when he comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me your father was at home again,\nand that was why I came, but it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on the main-\nland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or a prisoner among savages who are detaining\nhim against his will I am no prophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon me from\nheaven, and assure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even though he\nwere in chains of iron he would find some means of getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses\nreally have such a fine looking fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes, for\nwe were close friends before he set sail for Troy where the flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we\nhave never either of us seen the other.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it is a wise child that knows his own fa-\nther. Would that I were son to one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is no more\nill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my father.\u201d\nAnd Minerva said, \u201cThere is no fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope has such a fine son as you are.\nBut tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What is it all about?\nHave you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the family\u2014for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his\n238 The Odyssey\nown? And the guests\u2014how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to\ndisgust any respectable person who comes near them.\u201d\n\u201cSir,\u201d said Telemachus, \u201cas regards your question, so long as my father was here it was well with us and with the\nhouse, but the gods in their displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more closely than mor-\ntal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men\nbefore Troy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans\nwould have built a mound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the storm-\nwinds have spirited him away we know not wither; he is gone without leaving so much as a trace behind him, and\nI inherit nothing but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid\nsorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island\nof Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying their\ncourt to my mother, who will neither point blank say that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end; so\nthey are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so also with myself.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d exclaimed Minerva, \u201cthen you do indeed want Ulysses home again. Give him his helmet, shield,\nand a couple lances, and if he is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making merry,\nhe would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He\nwas then coming from Ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus\nfeared the ever-living gods and would not give him any, but my father let him have some, for he was very fond of\nhim. If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.\n\u201cBut there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return, and take his revenge in his own house\nor no; I would, however, urge you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice, call the\nAchaean heroes in assembly to-morrow\u2014lay your case before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the\nsuitors take themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother\u2019s mind is set on marrying again, let her go\nback to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a daughter\nmay expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men,\nand go in quest of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you something, or (and people\noften hear things in this way) some heaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor; thence\ngo on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and\non his way home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the\nother hand you hear of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a barrow\nto his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind how,\nby fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead infancy any longer;\nhave you not heard how people are singing Orestes\u2019 praises for having killed his father\u2019s murderer Aegisthus? You\nare a fine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must\ngo back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think the matter over for\nyourself, and remember what I have said to you.\u201d\n\u201cSir,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201cit has been very kind of you to talk to me in this way, as though I were your own\nson, and I will do all you tell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little longer till you\nhave taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will then give you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I\nwill give you one of great beauty and value\u2014a keepsake such as only dear friends give to one another.\u201d\nMinerva answered, \u201cDo not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at once. As for any present you may be\ndisposed to make me, keep it till I come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very good one,\nand I will give you one of no less value in return.\u201d\nWith these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had given Telemachus courage, and had made\nhim think more than ever about his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger had been\na god, so he went straight to where the suitors were sitting.\nPhemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and\nthe ills Minerva had laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from her room upstairs,\nand came down by the great staircase, not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the suit-\nors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side\nof her. She held a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.\n\u201cPhemius,\u201d she cried, \u201cyou know many another feat of gods and heroes, such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the\nsuitors some one of these, and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it breaks my sorrowful\nheart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all\nHellas and middle Argos.\u201d\n\u201cMother,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201clet the bard sing what he has a mind to; bards do not make the ills they sing\nof; it is Jove, not they, who makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good\n239 Compact Anthology of World Literature\npleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return of the Danaans, for people always applaud the\nlatest songs most warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only man who never came back\nfrom Troy, but many another went down as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily\nduties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for speech is man\u2019s matter, and mine above all\nothers\u2014for it is I who am master here.\u201d\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son\u2019s saying in her heart. Then, going upstairs with her\nhandmaids into her room, she mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes. But the suit-\nors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters, and prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.\nThen Telemachus spoke, \u201cShameless,\u201d he cried, \u201cand insolent suitors, let us feast at our pleasure now, and let\nthere be no brawling, for it is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has; but in the morn-\ning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal notice to depart, and feast at one another\u2019s houses, turn and\nturn about, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help\nme, but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father\u2019s house there shall be no man to avenge\nyou.\u201d\nThe suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of\nEupeithes, said, \u201cThe gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may Jove never grant you to be\nchief in Ithaca as your father was before you.\u201d\nTelemachus answered, \u201cAntinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing, I will be chief too if I can. Is this the\nworst fate you can think of for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches and honour. Still, now\nthat Ulysses is dead there are many great men in Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead\namong them; nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom Ulysses has won for me.\u201d\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, \u201cIt rests with heaven to decide who shall be chief among us, but\nyou shall be master in your own house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man in Ithaca shall\ndo you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I want to know about this stranger. What country does he\ncome from? Of what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news about the return of your father,\nor was he on business of his own? He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone in a\nmoment before we could get to know him.\u201d\n\u201cMy father is dead and gone,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201cand even if some rumour reaches me I put no more faith\nin it now. My mother does indeed sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings\nno heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father\u2019s.\u201d\nBut in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.\nThe suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening; but when night fell upon their plea-\nsuring they went home to bed each in his own abode. Telemachus\u2019s room was high up in a tower that looked on to\nthe outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and full of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops,\nthe son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes had bought her with his own mon-\ney when she was quite young; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to her in his\nhousehold as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her to his bed for he feared his wife\u2019s resentment.\nShe it was who now lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him better than any of the other women in the\nhouse did, for she had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon\nthe bed; as he took off his shirt he gave it to the good old woman, who folded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a\npeg by his bed side, after which she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt home by means\nof the strap. But Telemachus as he lay covered with a woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended\nvoyage of the counsel that Minerva had given him.\nBook II\nNOW when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus rose and dressed himself. He\nbound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like an\nimmortal god. He at once sent the criers round to call the people in assembly, so they called them and the people\ngathered thereon; then, when they were got together, he went to the place of assembly spear in hand\u2014not alone, for\nhis two hounds went with him. Minerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled\nat him as he went by, and when he took his place\u2019 in his father\u2019s seat even the oldest councillors made way for him.\nAegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience, the first to speak His son Antiphus had gone\nwith Ulysses to Ilius, land of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they were all shut up in the\ncave, and had cooked his last dinner for him, He had three sons left, of whom two still worked on their father\u2019s land,\nwhile the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors; nevertheless their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus,\nand was still weeping for him when he began his speech.\n240 The Odyssey\n\u201cMen of Ithaca,\u201d he said, \u201chear my words. From the day Ulysses left us there has been no meeting of our coun-\ncillors until now; who then can it be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary to convene us? Has he got\nwind of some host approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public\nmoment? I am sure he is an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him his heart\u2019s desire.\u201d\nTelemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he was bursting with what he had to say. He\nstood in the middle of the assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then, turning to Aegyptius,\n\u201cSir,\u201d said he, \u201cit is I, as you will shortly learn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I have\nnot got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you, nor is there any matter of public moment on\nwhich I would speak. My grieveance is purely personal, and turns on two great misfortunes which have fallen upon\nmy house. The first of these is the loss of my excellent father, who was chief among all you here present, and was like\na father to every one of you; the second is much more serious, and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The\nsons of all the chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against her will. They are afraid to go\nto her father Icarius, asking him to choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriage gifts for his daughter, but\nday by day they keep hanging about my father\u2019s house, sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets,\nand never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such recklessness; we\nhave now no Ulysses to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my\ndays be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such\ntreatment any longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences\nand to public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray\nyou by Jove and Themis, who is the beginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends, and leave me\nsinglehanded \u2014 unless it be that my brave father Ulysses did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now\navenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out of house and home at all, I had\nrather you did the eating yourselves, for I could then take action against you to some purpose, and serve you with\nnotices from house to house till I got paid in full, whereas now I have no remedy.\u201d\nWith this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into tears. Every one was very sorry for him, but\nthey all sat still and no one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who spoke thus:\n\u201cTelemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw the blame upon us suitors? It is your\nmother\u2019s fault not ours, for she is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four, she has been driv-\ning us out of our minds, by encouraging each one of us, and sending him messages without meaning one word of\nwhat she says. And then there was that other trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room, and\nbegan to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. \u2018Sweet hearts,\u2019 said she, \u2018Ulysses is indeed dead, still do not\npress me to marry again immediately, wait\u2014for I would not have skill in needlework perish unrecorded\u2014till I have\ncompleted a pall for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich,\nand the women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.\u2019\n\u201cThis was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her working on her great web all day long, but\nat night she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years and we never\nfound her out, but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was\ndoing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it whether she would or no.\nThe suitors, therefore, make you this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand-\u2019Send your mother\naway, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her father\u2019s choice\u2019; for I do not know what will happen if she\ngoes on plaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the accomplishments Minerva has\ntaught her, and because she is so clever. We never yet heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro, Alcmena,\nMycene, and the famous women of old, but they were nothing to your mother, any one of them. It was not fair of\nher to treat us in that way, and as long as she continues in the mind with which heaven has now endowed her, so\nlong shall we go on eating up your estate; and I do not see why she should change, for she gets all the honour and\nglory, and it is you who pay for it, not she. Understand, then, that we will not go back to our lands, neither here nor\nelsewhere, till she has made her choice and married some one or other of us.\u201d\nTelemachus answered, \u201cAntinous, how can I drive the mother who bore me from my father\u2019s house? My father\nis abroad and we do not know whether he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay Icarius the large\nsum which I must give him if I insist on sending his daughter back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with\nme, but heaven will also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house will calf on the Erinyes to avenge her;\nbesides, it would not be a creditable thing to do, and I will have nothing to say to it. If you choose to take offence\nat this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another\u2019s houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If, on the\nother hand, you elect to persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full,\nand when you fall in my father\u2019s house there shall be no man to avenge you.\u201d\nAs he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and they flew on and on with the wind, sailing\nside by side in their own lordly flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly they wheeled and cir-\n241 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ncled about, beating the air with their wings and glaring death into the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting\nfiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right over the town. The people wondered as they saw\nthem, and asked each other what an this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best prophet and reader of\nomens among them, spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying:\n\u201cHear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors, for I see mischief brewing for them. Ul-\nysses is not going to be away much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction, not on them\nalone, but on many another of us who live in Ithaca. Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop to this wickedness\nbefore he comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord; it will be better for them, for I am not prophesying\nwithout due knowledge; everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when the Argives set out for Troy, and he\nwith them. I said that after going through much hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the\ntwentieth year and that no one would know him; and now all this is coming true.\u201d\nEurymachus son of Polybus then said, \u201cGo home, old man, and prophesy to your own children, or it may be\nworse for them. I can read these omens myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about in the sun-\nshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has died in a far country, and it is a pity you are\nnot dead along with him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger of Telemachus which\nis fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he will give you something for your family, but I tell you\u2014and it shall\nsurely be\u2014when an old man like you, who should know better, talks a young one over till he becomes troublesome,\nin the first place his young friend will only fare so much the worse\u2014he will take nothing by it, for the suitors will\nprevent this\u2014and in the next, we will lay a heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you will at all like paying, for it will\nbear hardly upon you. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the presence of you all to send his mother back to her\nfather, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect. Till\nwe shall go on harassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neither for him, with all his fine speeches,\nnor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as much as you please, but we shall only hate you the more.\nWe shall go back and continue to eat up Telemachus\u2019s estate without paying him, till such time as his mother leaves\noff tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of expectation, each vying with the other in his suit for\na prize of such rare perfection. Besides we cannot go after the other women whom we should marry in due course,\nbut for the way in which she treats us.\u201d\nThen Telemachus said, \u201cEurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say no more, and entreat you no further, for\nthe gods and the people of Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men to take me\nhither and thither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos in quest of my father who has so long been missing. Some\none may tell me something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent message may direct me.\nIf I can hear of him as alive and on his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet another\ntwelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I will return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due\npomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make my mother marry again.\u201d\nWith these words he sat down, and Mentor who had been a friend of Ulysses, and had been left in charge of\neverything with full authority over the servants, rose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty addressed them\nthus:\n\u201cHear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and well-disposed ruler any more, nor one\nwho will govern you equitably; I hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for there is not\none of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as though he were your father. I am not half so angry with the\nsuitors, for if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts, and wager their heads that Ulysses will\nnot return, they can take the high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked at the way in which\nyou all sit still without even trying to stop such scandalous goings on-which you could do if you chose, for you are\nmany and they are few.\u201d\nLeiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, \u201cMentor, what folly is all this, that you should set the people to\nstay us? It is a hard thing for one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses himself were to set\nupon us while we are feasting in his house, and do his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly,\nwould have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon his own head if he fought against such great\nodds. There is no sense in what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you people go about your business, and\nlet his father\u2019s old friends, Mentor and Halitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all\u2014which I do not\nthink he will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes and tells him something.\u201d\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own abode, while the suitors returned to the\nhouse of Ulysses.\nThen Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the grey waves, and prayed to Minerva.\n\u201cHear me,\u201d he cried, \u201cyou god who visited me yesterday, and bade me sail the seas in search of my father who\nhas so long been missing. I would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked suitors, are hinder-\ning me that I cannot do so.\u201d\n242 The Odyssey\nAs he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and with the voice of Mentor. \u201cTelemachus,\u201d\nsaid she, \u201cif you are made of the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward, for Ul-\nysses never broke his word nor left his work half done. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless,\nbut unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons\nare seldom as good men as their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as you are not going to be either\nfool or coward henceforward, and are not entirely without some share of your father\u2019s wise discernment, I look with\nhope upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause with any of those foolish suitors, for they\nhave neither sense nor virtue, and give no thought to death and to the doom that will shortly fall on one and all\nof them, so that they shall perish on the same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long delayed; your father was\nsuch an old friend of mine that I will find you a ship, and will come with you myself. Now, however, return home,\nand go about among the suitors; begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see everything well stowed, the\nwine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the staff of life, in leathern bags, while I go round the town and beat up\nvolunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I will run my eye over them for you and will\nchoose the best; we will get her ready and will put out to sea without delay.\u201d\nThus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in doing as the goddess told him. He went\nmoodily and found the suitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous came up to him at once\nand laughed as he took his hand in his own, saying, \u201cTelemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither\nin word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do. The Achaeans will find you in everything\u2014a ship\nand a picked crew to boot\u2014so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your noble father.\u201d\n\u201cAntinous,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201cI cannot eat in peace, nor take pleasure of any kind with such men as you\nare. Was it not enough that you should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy? Now that I am\nolder and know more about it, I am also stronger, and whether here among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will\ndo you all the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain though, thanks to you suitors, I have neither\nship nor crew of my own, and must be passenger not captain.\u201d\nAs he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the others went on getting dinner ready\nabout the buildings, jeering at him tauntingly as they did so.\n\u201cTelemachus,\u201d said one youngster, \u201cmeans to be the death of us; I suppose he thinks he can bring friends to help\nhim from Pylos, or again from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to Ephyra as well, for poison to\nput in our wine and kill us?\u201d\nAnother said, \u201cPerhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be like his father and perish far from his\nfriends. In this case we should have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his property amongst us: as for the\nhouse we can let his mother and the man who marries her have that.\u201d\nThis was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty and spacious store-room where his father\u2019s\ntreasure of gold and bronze lay heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were kept in open\nchests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant olive oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit for\na god to drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should come home again after all. The room was closed\nwith well-made doors opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Euryclea, daughter of Ops the\nson of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both night and day. Telemachus called her to the store-room and said:\n\u201cNurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you are keeping for my father\u2019s own drinking,\nin case, poor man, he should escape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve jars, and see\nthat they all have lids; also fill me some well-sewn leathern bags with barley meal\u2014about twenty measures in all.\nGet these things put together at once, and say nothing about it. I will take everything away this evening as soon as\nmy mother has gone upstairs for the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can hear anything about the\nreturn of my dear father.\nWhen Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him, saying, \u201cMy dear child, what ever can\nhave put such notion as that into your head? Where in the world do you want to go to\u2014you, who are the one hope\nof the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign country nobody knows where, and as soon as your\nback is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of the way, and will share all your posses-\nsions among themselves; stay where you are among your own people, and do not go wandering and worrying your\nlife out on the barren ocean.\u201d\n\u201cFear not, nurse,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201cmy scheme is not without heaven\u2019s sanction; but swear that you will\nsay nothing about all this to my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she hears of my hav-\ning gone, and asks you; for I do not want her to spoil her beauty by crying.\u201d\nThe old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had completed her oath, she began\ndrawing off the wine into jars, and getting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back to the suitors.\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and went round the town to each one of the\ncrew, telling them to meet at the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and asked him to let\n243 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nher have a ship\u2014which he was very ready to do. When the sun had set and darkness was over all the land, she got\nthe ship into the water, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry, and stationed her at the end of the\nharbour. Presently the crew came up, and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them.\nFurthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors into a deep slumber. She caused their\ndrink to fuddle them, and made them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of sitting over their wine,\nthey went back into the town to sleep, with their eyes heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and\nvoice of Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside.\n\u201cTelemachus,\u201d said she, \u201cthe men are on board and at their oars, waiting for you to give your orders, so make\nhaste and let us be off.\u201d\nOn this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. When they got to the ship they found the crew\nwaiting by the water side, and Telemachus said, \u201cNow my men, help me to get the stores on board; they are all put\ntogether in the cloister, and my mother does not know anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one.\u201d\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after. When they had brought the things as he told\nthem, Telemachus went on board, Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel, while\nTelemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the hawsers and took their places on the benches. Minerva sent\nthem a fair wind from the West, that whistled over the deep blue waves whereon Telemachus told them to catch\nhold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank,\nraised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide.\nAs the sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue water, and the foam hissed against her\nbows as she sped onward. Then they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowls to the brim, and\nmade drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from everlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daugh-\nter of Jove.\nThus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night from dark till dawn.\nBook III\nBUT as the sun was rising from the fair sea into the firmament of heaven to shed Blight on mortals and immor-\ntals, they reached Pylos the city of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore to offer sacrifice\nof black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake. There were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there\nwere nine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats and burning the thigh bones [on the embers]\nin the name of Neptune, Telemachus and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship to anchor, and went\nashore.\nMinerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said, \u201cTelemachus, you must not be in the\nleast shy or nervous; you have taken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and how he came by\nhis end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may see what he has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he\nwill tell no lies, for he is an excellent person.\u201d\n\u201cBut how, Mentor,\u201d replied Telemachus, \u201cdare I go up to Nestor, and how am I to address him? I have never yet\nbeen used to holding long conversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning one who is so much\nolder than myself.\u201d\n\u201cSome things, Telemachus,\u201d answered Minerva, \u201cwill be suggested to you by your own instinct, and heaven will\nprompt you further; for I am assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth until now.\u201d\nShe then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till they reached the place where the guilds\nof the Pylian people were assembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his company round him\nwere busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces of meat on to the spits while other pieces were cooking. When\nthey saw the strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and bade them take their places. Nestor\u2019s\nson Pisistratus at once offered his hand to each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were lying on\nthe sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then he gave them their portions of the inward meats and\npoured wine for them into a golden cup, handing it to Minerva first, and saluting her at the same time.\n\u201cOffer a prayer, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cto King Neptune, for it is his feast that you are joining; when you have duly prayed\nand made your drink-offering, pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt not that he too lifts his\nhands in prayer, for man cannot live without God in the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an\nage with myself, so I he handed I will give you the precedence.\u201d\nAs he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and proper of him to have given it to herself\nfirst; she accordingly began praying heartily to Neptune. \u201cO thou,\u201d she cried, \u201cthat encirclest the earth, vouchsafe to\ngrant the prayers of thy servants that call upon thee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace on Nestor\nand on his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb\nthey are offering you. Lastly, grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of the matter that has brought\n244 The Odyssey\nus in our to Pylos.\u201d\nWhen she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to Telemachus and he prayed likewise. By and\nby, when the outer meats were roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man his portion\nand they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene,\nbegan to speak.\n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cthat our guests have done their dinner, it will be best to ask them who they are. Who, then, sir\nstrangers, are you, and from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail the seas as rovers with your\nhand against every man, and every man\u2019s hand against you?\u201d\nTelemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask about his father and get himself a good\nname.\n\u201cNestor,\u201d said he, \u201cson of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, you ask whence we come, and I will tell you.\nWe come from Ithaca under Neritum, and the matter about which I would speak is of private not public import.\nI seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said to have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself.\nWe know what fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy, but as regards Ulysses heaven has hid-\nden from us the knowledge even that he is dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished, nor say\nwhether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at sea amid the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant\nat your knees, if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own eyes,\nor heard it from some other traveller, for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for\nme, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, either by\nword or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell\nme truly all.\u201d\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d answered Nestor, \u201cyou recall a time of much sorrow to my mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered\nmuch both at sea, while privateering under Achilles, and when fighting before the great city of king Priam. Our best\nmen all of them fell there\u2014Ajax, Achilles, Patroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a\nman singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much more than this; what mortal tongue indeed\ncould tell the whole story? Though you were to stay here and question me for five years, or even six, I could not tell\nyou all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years\ndid we try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us; during all this time there was no one\nwho could compare with your father in subtlety\u2014if indeed you are his son\u2014I can hardly believe my eyes\u2014and you\ntalk just like him too\u2014no one would say that people of such different ages could speak so much alike. He and I nev-\ner had any kind of difference from first to last neither in camp nor council, but in singleness of heart and purpose\nwe advised the Argives how all might be ordered for the best.\n\u201cWhen however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail in our ships as heaven had dispersed us,\nthen Jove saw fit to vex the Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had Not all been either wise or understand-\ning, and hence many came to a bad end through the displeasure of Jove\u2019s daughter Minerva, who brought about a\nquarrel between the two sons of Atreus.\n\u201cThe sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be, for it was sunset and the Achaeans were\nheavy with wine. When they explained why they had called\u2014the people together, it seemed that Menelaus was for\nsailing homeward at once, and this displeased Agamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we had offered\nhecatombs to appease the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he might have known that he would not prevail with\nher, for when the gods have made up their minds they do not change them lightly. So the two stood bandying hard\nwords, whereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the air, and were of two minds as to what they\nshould do.\n\u201cThat night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching mischief against us. But in the morning\nsome of us drew our ships into the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest, about half\nin number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We\u2014the other half\u2014embarked and sailed; and the ships went well,\nfor heaven had smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the gods, for we were longing\nto get home; cruel Jove, however, did not yet mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in the course\nof which some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away under Ulysses to make their peace with\nAgamemnon; but I, and all the ships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was brewing. The\nson of Tydeus went on also with me, and his crews with him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found us\nmaking up our minds about our course\u2014for we did not know whether to go outside Chios by the island of Psyra,\nkeeping this to our left, or inside Chios, over against the stormy headland of Mimas. So we asked heaven for a sign,\nand were shown one to the effect that we should be soonest out of danger if we headed our ships across the open sea\nto Euboea. This we therefore did, and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage during the night to Ger-\naestus, where we offered many sacrifices to Neptune for having helped us so far on our way. Four days later Diomed\nand his men stationed their ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind never fell light from the day when\n245 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nheaven first made it fair for me.\n\u201cTherefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything about the others. I know neither who\ngot home safely nor who were lost but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports that have\nreached me since I have been here in my own house. They say the Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles\u2019\nson Neoptolemus; so also did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again, lost no men at sea, and all his\nfollowers who escaped death in the field got safe home with him to Crete. No matter how far out of the world you\nlive, you will have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of Aegisthus\u2014and a fearful reck-\noning did Aegisthus presently pay. See what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as Orestes\ndid, who killed false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble father. You too, then\u2014for you are a tall, smart-looking\nfellow\u2014show your mettle and make yourself a name in story.\u201d\n\u201cNestor son of Neleus,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201chonour to the Achaean name, the Achaeans applaud Orestes\nand his name will live through all time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might grant me to\ndo like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors, who are ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods\nhave no such happiness in store for me and for my father, so we must bear it as best we may.\u201d\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d said Nestor, \u201cnow that you remind me, I remember to have heard that your mother has many\nsuitors, who are ill disposed towards you and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely, or are\npublic feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who knows but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay\nthese scoundrels in full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him? If Minerva were to take as\ngreat a liking to you as she did to Ulysses when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so openly\nfond of any one as Minerva then was of your father), if she would take as good care of you as she did of him, these\nwooers would soon some of them him, forget their wooing.\u201d\nTelemachus answered, \u201cI can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far too much to hope for. I dare not let\nmyself think of it. Even though the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me.\u201d\nOn this Minerva said, \u201cTelemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven has a long arm if it is minded to save a\nman; and if it were me, I should not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided I could be safe when I\nwas once there. I would rather this, than get home quickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was\nby the treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain, and when a man\u2019s hour is come, not even the gods\ncan save him, no matter how fond they are of him.\u201d\n\u201cMentor,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201cdo not let us talk about it any more. There is no chance of my father\u2019s ever\ncoming back; the gods have long since counselled his destruction. There is something else, however, about which\nI should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much more than any one else does. They say he has reigned for three\ngenerations so that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor, and tell me true; how did Agamem-\nnon come to die in that way? What was Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far better a man\nthan himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging elsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took\nheart and killed Agamemnon?\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you truly,\u201d answered Nestor, \u201cand indeed you have yourself divined how it all happened. If Menelaus\nwhen he got back from Troy had found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been no barrow heaped\nup for him, not even when he was dead, but he would have been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures, and\nnot a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but we were over there, fight-\ning hard at Troy, and Aegisthus who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon\u2019s wife\nClytemnestra with incessant flattery.\n\u201cAt first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for she was of a good natural disposition; more-\nover there was a bard with her, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy, that he was to\nkeep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled her destruction, Aegisthus thus this bard off to a desert\nisland and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon\u2014after which she went willingly enough to the house\nof Aegisthus. Then he offered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many temples with tapestries and\ngilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations.\n\u201cMeanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms with one another. When we got\nto Sunium, which is the point of Athens, Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of Menelaus\u2019\nship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in rough weather) so that he died then and there with the\nhelm in his hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press forward, had to wait in order to bury his comrade\nand give him his due funeral rites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far as the\nMalean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here he\ndivided his fleet and took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of the river\nIardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place called Gortyn, and all along\nthis part of the coast as far as Phaestus the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but arter Phaestus the\ncoast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great shelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to\n246 The Odyssey\nthe rocks and wrecked; but the crews just managed to save themselves. As for the other five ships, they were taken\nby winds and seas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and substance among people of an alien speech.\nMeanwhile Aegisthus here at home plotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled\nin Mycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year Orestes came back from Athens to be\nhis bane, and killed the murderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and of false Aeg-\nisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and on that very day Menelaus came home, with as much treasure as his\nships could carry.\n\u201cTake my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far from home, nor leave your property with\nsuch dangerous people in your house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been\non a fool\u2019s errand. Still, I should advise you by all means to go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage\namong such distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from, when the winds had once carried him so\nfar out of his reckoning; even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth, so vast and terrible are the seas that\nthey must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take your own men with you; or if you would rather travel by\nland you can have a chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to Lacedaemon where\nMenelaus lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.\u201d\nAs he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said, \u201cSir, all that you have said is well; now,\nhowever, order the tongues of the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to Neptune,\nand the other immortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed time. People should go away early and not keep late hours\nat a religious festival.\u201d\nThus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men servants poured water over the hands of the\nguests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man his\ndrink-offering; then they threw the tongues of the victims into the fire, and stood up to make their drink-offerings.\nWhen they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Minerva and Telemachus were\nforgoing on board their ship, but Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.\n\u201cHeaven and the immortal gods,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cforbid that you should leave my house to go on board of a\nship. Do you think I am so poor and short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find com-\nfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let me tell you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not\npermit the son of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship\u2014not while I live\u2014nor yet will my sons\nafter me, but they will keep open house as have done.\u201d\nThen Minerva answered, \u201cSir, you have spoken well, and it will be much better that Telemachus should do as\nyou have said; he, therefore, shall return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give orders to my\ncrew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only older person among them; the rest are all young men of Telema-\nchus\u2019 own age, who have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return to the ship and sleep there. Moreover\nto-morrow I must go to the Cauconians where I have a large sum of money long owing to me. As for Telemachus,\nnow that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and let one of your sons go with him. Be pleased\nalso to provide him with your best and fleetest horses.\u201d\nWhen she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and all marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor\nwas astonished, and took Telemachus by the hand. \u201cMy friend,\u201d said he, \u201cI see that you are going to be a great hero\nsome day, since the gods wait upon you thus while you are still so young. This can have been none other of those\nwho dwell in heaven than Jove\u2019s redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who showed such favour towards your brave\nfather among the Argives.\u201d \u201cHoly queen,\u201d he continued, \u201cvouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself, my good\nwife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and\nnever yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.\u201d\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to his own house, followed by his sons and\nsons-in-law. When they had got there and had taken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed them a bowl\nof sweet wine that was eleven years old when the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed the\nwine, he prayed much and made drink-offerings to Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had\nmade their drink-offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home to bed each in his\nown abode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room that was over the gateway along with Pisistratus, who\nwas the only unmarried son now left him. As for himself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the queen his\nwife by his side.\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Nestor left his couch and took his seat on the\nbenches of white and polished marble that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of gods in\ncounsel, but he was now dead, and had gone to the house of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat, sceptre in hand, as\nguardian of the public weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round him, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus,\nAretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them they made him sit with\nthem. Nestor then addressed them.\n247 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u201cMy sons,\u201d said he, \u201cmake haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first and foremost to propitiate the great goddess\nMinerva, who manifested herself visibly to me during yesterday\u2019s festivities. Go, then, one or other of you to the\nplain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer, and come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemachus\u2019s\nship, and invite all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the vessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus\nthe goldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the maids in the house to\nprepare an excellent dinner, and to fetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also\u2014to bring me\nsome clear spring water.\u201d\nOn this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was brought in from the plain, and Telemachus\u2019s\ncrew came from the ship; the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he worked his gold, and\nMinerva herself came to the sacrifice. Nestor gave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that\nthe goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus\nfetched water from the house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand he held a basket of\nbarley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket.\nThen Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley meal, and he offered many a prayer to Miner-\nva as he threw a lock from the heifer\u2019s head upon the fire.\nWhen they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal Thrasymedes dealt his blow, and brought the\nheifer down with a stroke that cut through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters and daugh-\nters-in-law of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she was eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with\ndelight. Then they lifted the heifer\u2019s head from off the ground, and Pisistratus cut her throat. When she had done\nbleeding and was quite dead, they cut her up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round\nin two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire\nand poured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When the\nthighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on\nthe spits and toasted them over the fire.\nMeanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor\u2019s youngest daughter, washed Telemachus. When she had washed him and\nanointed him with oil, she brought him a fair mantle and shirt, and he looked like a god as he came from the bath\nand took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down\nto dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept pouring them out their wine in cups\nof gold. As soon as they had had had enough to eat and drink Nestor said, \u201cSons, put Telemachus\u2019s horses to the\nchariot that he may start at once.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the fleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper\npacked them up a provision of bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons of princes. Then Telemachus got into\nthe chariot, while Pisistratus gathered up the reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they\nflew forward nothing loth into the open country, leaving the high citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did\nthey travel, swaying the yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the land. Then they\nreached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortilochus and grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the\nnight and Diocles entertained them hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn; appeared, they\nagain yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse. Pisistratus lashed the\nhorses on and they flew forward nothing loth; presently they came to the corn lands Of the open country, and in\nthe course of time completed their journey, so well did their steeds take them.\nNow when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,\nBook IV\nTHEY reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon them where they drove straight to the of abode Menelaus [and\nfound him in his own house, feasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son, and also of his\ndaughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that valiant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and prom-\nised her to him while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing the marriage about; so he was sending\nher with chariots and horses to the city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles\u2019 son was reigning. For his only son\nhe had found a bride from Sparta, daughter of Alector. This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman,\nfor heaven vouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who was fair as golden Venus her-\nself.\nSo the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making merry in his house. There was a bard\nalso to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the\nman struck up with his tune.]\nTelemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate, whereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came\nout, and as soon as he saw them ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went close up to him and\n248 The Odyssey\nsaid, \u201cMenelaus, there are some strangers come here, two men, who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall\nwe take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?\u201d\nMenelaus was very angry and said, \u201cEteoneus, son of Boethous, you never used to be a fool, but now you talk\nlike a simpleton. Take their horses out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have supper; you and I\nhave stayed often enough at other people\u2019s houses before we got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in\npeace henceforward.\u201d\nSo Eteoneus bustled back and bade other servants come with him. They took their sweating hands from under\nthe yoke, made them fast to the mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they leaned the char-\niot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led the way into the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were aston-\nished when they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon; then, when they had admired everything\nto their heart\u2019s content, they went into the bath room and washed themselves.\nWhen the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they brought them woollen cloaks and shirts,\nand the two took their seats by the side of Menelaus. A maidservant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer,\nand poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper\nservant brought them bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the house, while the carver\nfetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side.\nMenelaus then greeted them saying, \u201cFall to, and welcome; when you have done supper I shall ask who you are,\nfor the lineage of such men as you cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of sceptre-bearing\nkings, for poor people do not have such sons as you are.\u201d\nOn this he handed them a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set near him as being a prime part, and\nthey laid their hands on the good things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\nTelemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so close that no one might hear, \u201cLook, Pisistratus, man after\nmy own heart, see the gleam of bronze and gold\u2014of amber, ivory, and silver. Everything is so splendid that it is like\nseeing the palace of Olympian Jove. I am lost in admiration.\u201d\nMenelaus overheard him and said, \u201cNo one, my sons, can hold his own with Jove, for his house and everything\nabout him is immortal; but among mortal men\u2014well, there may be another who has as much wealth as I have, or\nthere may not; but at all events I have travelled much and have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight\nyears before I could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the Egyptians; I went also to the Ethi-\nopians, the Sidonians, and the Erembians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born, and\nthe sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that country, whether master or man, has plenty of cheese,\nmeat, and good milk, for the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was travelling and getting great riches among\nthese people, my brother was secretly and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife, so that I\nhave no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth. Whoever your parents may be they must have told you about all\nthis, and of my heavy loss in the ruin of a stately mansion fully and magnificently furnished. Would that I had only\na third of what I now have so that I had stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the plain of Troy,\nfar from Argos. I of grieve, as I sit here in my house, for one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but\npresently I leave off again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I may, I do so\nfor one man more than for them all. I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and sleep, so miserable\ndoes he make me, for no one of all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing by it,\nand has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he has been gone a long time, and we know not whether he is alive or\ndead. His old father, his long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he left behind him an infant\nin arms, are plunged in grief on his account.\u201d\nThus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he bethought him of his father. Tears fell from\nhis eyes as he heard him thus mentioned, so that he held his cloak before his face with both hands. When Menelaus\nsaw this he doubted whether to let him choose his own time for speaking, or to ask him at once and find what it was\nall about.\nWhile he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted and perfumed room, looking as\nlovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought her a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the silver\nwork-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus lived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city\nin the whole world; he gave Menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and ten talents of gold; besides all\nthis, his wife gave Helen some beautiful presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work-box that ran on wheels,\nwith a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed this by her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged\nwith violet coloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her feet upon the footstool, and\nbegan to question her husband.\n\u201cDo we know, Menelaus,\u201d said she, \u201cthe names of these strangers who have come to visit us? Shall I guess right\nor wrong?\u2014but I cannot help saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like somebody\nelse (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what to think) as this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulyss-\n249 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nes left as a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in your hearts, on account of my most\nshameless self.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear wife,\u201d replied Menelaus, \u201cI see the likeness just as you do. His hands and feet are just like Ulysses\u2019; so is\nhis hair, with the shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was talking about Ulysses, and\nsaying how much he had suffered on my account, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle.\u201d\nThen Pisistratus said, \u201cMenelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in thinking that this young man is Telemachus,\nbut he is very modest, and is ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose conversation is\nso divinely interesting as your own. My father, Nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know wheth-\ner you could give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home when his father has gone away\nleaving him without supporters; and this is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent, and there is no\none among his own people to stand by him.\u201d\n\u201cBless my heart,\u201d replied Menelaus, \u201cthen I am receiving a visit from the son of a very dear friend, who suf-\nfered much hardship for my sake. I had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when heaven\nhad granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should have founded a city for him in Argos, and built him a\nhouse. I should have made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people, and should have sacked for\nthem some one of the neighbouring cities that are subject to me. We should thus have seen one another continually,\nand nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an intercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven\ngrudged us such great good fortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at all.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept, Telemachus wept, and so did Menelaus,\nnor could Pisistratus keep his eyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom the son of\nbright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaus,\n\u201cSir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told me you were a person of rare and excel-\nlent understanding. If, then, it be possible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am getting my\nsupper. Morning will come in due course, and in the forenoon I care not how much I cry for those that are dead\nand gone. This is all we can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and wring the tears from\nour cheeks. I had a brother who died at Troy; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure to have known\nhim\u2014his name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say that he was singularly fleet of foot\nand in fight valiant.\u201d\n\u201cYour discretion, my friend,\u201d answered Menelaus, \u201cis beyond your years. It is plain you take after your father.\nOne can soon see when a man is son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and offspring\u2014and it\nhas blessed Nestor from first to last all his days, giving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him\nwho are both we disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore to all this weeping, and attend to our supper\nagain. Let water be poured over our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in the morning.\u201d\nOn this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands and they laid their hands on the good\nthings that were before them.\nThen Jove\u2019s daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged the wine with an herb that banishes\nall care, sorrow, and ill humour. Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest of the day,\nnot even though his father and mother both of them drop down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces\nbefore his very eyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had been given to Helen by Polydamna wife of\nThon, a woman of Egypt, where there grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into the mixing-bowl and others\npoisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country is a skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When\nHelen had put this drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve the wine round, she said:\n\u201cMenelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable men (which is as Jove wills, for he is\nthe giver both of good and evil, and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I tell you a tale\nin season. I cannot indeed name every single one of the exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he was\nbefore Troy, and you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed\nhimself all in rags, and entered the enemy\u2019s city looking like a menial or a beggar. and quite different from what\nhe did when he was among his own people. In this disguise he entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything\nto him. I alone recognized him and began to question him, but he was too cunning for me. When, however, I had\nwashed and anointed him and had given him clothes, and after I had sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the\nTrojans till he had got safely back to his own camp and to the ships, he told me all that the Achaeans meant to do.\nHe killed many Trojans and got much information before he reached the Argive camp, for all which things the Tro-\njan women made lamentation, but for my own part I was glad, for my heart was beginning to oam after my home,\nand I was unhappy about wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there, away from my country, my girl,\nand my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by no means deficient either in person or understanding.\u201d\nThen Menelaus said, \u201cAll that you have been saying, my dear wife, is true. I have travelled much, and have had\nmuch to do with heroes, but I have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too, and what courage\n250 The Odyssey\nhe displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the bravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and\ndestruction upon the Trojans. At that moment you came up to us; some god who wished well to the Trojans must\nhave set you on to it and you had Deiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding place and pat\nit; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and mimicked all our wives\u2014Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats\ninside heard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds whether to spring out then and\nthere, or to answer you from inside, but Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite still, all except Anticlus, who\nwas beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped his two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It\nwas this that saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away again.\u201d\n\u201cHow sad,\u201d exclaimed Telemachus, \u201cthat all this was of no avail to save him, nor yet his own iron courage. But\nnow, sir, be pleased to send us all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.\u201d\nOn this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that was in the gatehouse, and to make them with\ngood red rugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to wear. So the maids\nwent out, carrying a torch, and made the beds, to which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus,\nthen, did Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while the son of Atreus lay in an inner room with\nlovely Helen by his side.\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Menelaus rose and dressed himself. He bound his\nsandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like an immortal god.\nThen, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:\n\u201cAnd what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to Lacedaemon? Are you on public or private\nbusiness? Tell me all about it.\u201d\n\u201cI have come, sir replied Telemachus, \u201cto see if you can tell me anything about my father. I am being eaten out\nof house and home; my fair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep killing great num-\nbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of paying their addresses to my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at\nyour knees if haply you may tell me about my father\u2019s melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or\nheard it from some other traveller; for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for myself,\nbut tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by word\nor deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly\nall.\u201d\nMenelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. \u201cSo,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthese cowards would usurp a brave\nman\u2019s bed? A hind might as well lay her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or\nin some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his lair will make short work with the pair of them\u2014and so will\nUlysses with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wres-\ntled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him \u2014 if he is still such\nand were to come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions,\nhowever, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without concealment all that the old man of the sea\ntold me.\n\u201cI was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for my hecatombs had not given them full\nsatisfaction, and the gods are very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a ship can sail in a\nday with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an island called Pharos\u2014it has a good harbour from which vessels\ncan get out into open sea when they have taken in water\u2014and the gods becalmed me twenty days without so much\nas a breath of fair wind to help me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my men would have\nstarved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the\nold man of the sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me.\n\u201cShe came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the men used to go with their barbed hooks,\nall over the island in the hope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger. \u2018Stranger,\u2019 said she,\n\u2018it seems to me that you like starving in this way\u2014at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you stick here day\nafter day, without even trying to get away though your men are dying by inches.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Let me tell you,\u2019 said I, \u2018whichever of the goddesses you may happen to be, that I am not staying here of my\nown accord, but must have offended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods know everything.\nwhich of the immortals it is that is hindering me in this way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach\nmy home.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Stranger,\u2019 replied she, \u2018I will make it all quite clear to you. There is an old immortal who lives under the sea\nhereabouts and whose name is Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is Neptune\u2019s head man\nand knows every inch of ground all over the bottom of the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will tell\nyou about your voyage, what courses you are to take, and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home. He\nwill also tell you, if you so will, all that has been going on at your house both good and bad, while you have been\naway on your long and dangerous journey.\u2019\n251 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u201c\u2019Can you show me,\u2019 said I, \u2018some stratagem by means of which I may catch this old god without his suspecting\nit and finding me out? For a god is not easily caught\u2014not by a mortal man.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Stranger,\u2019 said she, \u2018I will make it all quite clear to you. About the time when the sun shall have reached mid\nheaven, the old man of the sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs the water over\nhis head. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and goes to sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals\u2014Halo-\nsydne\u2019s chickens as they call them\u2014come up also from the grey sea, and go to sleep in shoals all round him; and a\nvery strong and fish-like smell do they bring with them. Early to-morrow morning I will take you to this place and\nwill lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three best men you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks\nthat the old man will play you.\n\u201c\u2019First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he has seen them and tallied them on his five\nfingers, he will go to sleep among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he is asleep seize\nhim; put forth all your strength and hold him fast, for he will do his very utmost to get away from you. He will turn\nhimself into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth, and will become also both fire and water; but you must\nhold him fast and grip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you and comes back to what he was when you\nsaw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the gods it is\nthat is angry with you, and what you must do to reach your home over the seas.\u2019\n\u201cHaving so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the place where my ships were ranged\nupon the shore; and my heart was clouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper ready,\nfor night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.\n\u201cWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I took the three men on whose prowess of all\nkinds I could most rely, and went along by the sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the goddess fetched\nme up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all of them just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her\nfather. Then she dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we should come up. When we were close\nto her, she made us lie down in the pits one after the other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our ambuscade\nwould have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy seals was most distressing\u2014who would go to bed with a sea\nmonster if he could help it?-but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of something that gave us great relief,\nfor she put some ambrosia under each man\u2019s nostrils, which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of the seals.\n\u201cWe waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the seals come up in hundreds to bask upon\nthe sea shore, till at noon the old man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals he went over\nthem and counted them. We were among the first he counted, and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself\ndown to sleep as soon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and seized him; on which\nhe began at once with his old tricks, and changed himself first into a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he\nbecame a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was running water, and then again directly he was\na tree, but we stuck to him and never lost hold, till at last the cunning old creature became distressed, and said,\nWhich of the gods was it, Son of Atreus, that hatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizing me against my\nwill? What do you want?\u2019\n\u201c\u2019You know that yourself, old man,\u2019 I answered, \u2018you will gain nothing by trying to put me off. It is because I\nhave been kept so long in this island, and see no sign of my being able to get away. I am losing all heart; tell me,\nthen, for you gods know everything, which of the immortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me also how I may\nsail the sea so as to reach my home?\u2019\n\u201cThen,\u2019 he said, \u2018if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly, you must offer sacrifices to Jove and to\nthe rest of the gods before embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your friends, and to your own\nhouse, till you have returned to the heaven fed stream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal gods\nthat reign in heaven. When you have done this they will let you finish your voyage.\u2019\n\u201cI was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long and terrible voyage to Egypt; nevertheless,\nI answered, \u2018I will do all, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me true, whether all the\nAchaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we set sail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of\nthem came to a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends when the days of his fighting were done.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Son of Atreus,\u2019 he answered, \u2018why ask me? You had better not know what I can tell you, for your eyes will sure-\nly fill when you have heard my story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone, but many still remain,\nand only two of the chief men among the Achaeans perished during their return home. As for what happened on\nthe field of battle\u2014you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea, alive, but hindered from returning.\nAjax was wrecked, for Neptune drove him on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he let him get safe out of the\nwater, and in spite of all Minerva\u2019s hatred he would have escaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting. He\nsaid the gods could not drown him even though they had tried to do so, and when Neptune heard this large talk,\nhe seized his trident in his two brawny hands, and split the rock of Gyrae in two pieces. The base remained where it\nwas, but the part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong into the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he drank salt water\n252 The Odyssey\nand was drowned.\n\u201c\u2019Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, but when he was just about to reach the high\npromontory of Malea, he was caught by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against his will, and\ndrove him to the foreland where Thyestes used to dwell, but where Aegisthus was then living. By and by, howev-\ner, it seemed as though he was to return safely after all, for the gods backed the wind into its old quarter and they\nreached home; whereon Agamemnon kissed his native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in his own\ncountry.\n\u201c\u2019Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch, and to whom he had promised two\ntalents of gold. This man had been looking out for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the\nslip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon go by, he went and told Aegisthus who at once\nbegan to lay a plot for him. He picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them in ambuscade on one side the\ncloister, while on the opposite side he prepared a banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen to Agamemnon,\nand invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there, all unsuspicious of the doom that was await-\ning him, and killed him when the banquet was over as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles; not one of\nAgamemnon\u2019s followers was left alive, nor yet one of Aegisthus\u2019, but they were all killed there in the cloisters.\u2019\n\u201cThus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat down upon the sands and wept; I felt as\nthough I could no longer bear to live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had had my fill of weep-\ning and writhing upon the ground, the old man of the sea said, \u2018Son of Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying\nso bitterly; it can do no manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you can, for Aegisthus be still alive, and\neven though Orestes has beforehand with you in kilting him, you may yet come in for his funeral.\u2019\n\u201cOn this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, \u2018I know, then, about these two; tell me, therefore,\nabout the third man of whom you spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to get home? or is he dead? Tell me,\nno matter how much it may grieve me.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019The third man,\u2019 he answered, \u2018is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. I can see him in an island sorrowing bitter-\nly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for he has no\nships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As for your own end, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods\nwill take you to the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There fair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and\nmen lead an easier life than any where else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain, nor hail, nor snow, but\nOceanus breathes ever with a West wind that sings softly from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men. This will hap-\npen to you because you have married Helen, and are Jove\u2019s son-in-law.\u2019\n\u201cAs he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the ships with my companions, and my heart\nwas clouded with care as I went along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night was falling, and\ncamped down upon the beach. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into\nthe water, and put our masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves, took our seats on the bench-\nes, and smote the grey sea with our oars. I again stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered\nhecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased heaven\u2019s anger, I raised a barrow to the memory\nof Agamemnon that his name might live for ever, after which I had a quick passage home, for the gods sent me a\nfair wind.\n\u201cAnd now for yourself\u2014stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and I will then speed you on your way. I will\nmake you a noble present of a chariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful chalice that so long as you\nlive you may think of me whenever you make a drink-offering to the immortal gods.\u201d\n\u201cSon of Atreus,\u201d replied Telemachus, \u201cdo not press me to stay longer; I should be contented to remain with you\nfor another twelve months; I find your conversation so delightful that I should never once wish myself at home with\nmy parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos are already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. As\nfor any present you may be disposed to make me, I had rather that it should he a piece of plate. I will take no horses\nback with me to Ithaca, but will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you have much flat ground in your king-\ndom where lotus thrives, as also meadowsweet and wheat and barley, and oats with their white and spreading ears;\nwhereas in Ithaca we have neither open fields nor racecourses, and the country is more fit for goats than horses, and\nI like it the better for that. None of our islands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and Ithaca least of all.\u201d\nMenelaus smiled and took Telemachus\u2019s hand within his own. \u201cWhat you say,\u201d said he, \u201cshows that you come of\ngood family. I both can, and will, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most precious piece of\nplate in all my house. It is a mixing-bowl by Vulcan\u2019s own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with\ngold. Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a visit which I paid him when I returned thither\non my homeward journey. I will make you a present of it.\u201d\nThus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king\u2019s house. They brought sheep and wine, while their\nwives had put up bread for them to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in the courts].\nMeanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of\n253 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nUlysses\u2019 house, and were behaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who were their ringlead-\ners and much the foremost among them all, were sitting together when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said\nto Antinous,\n\u201cHave we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos? He has a ship of mine, and I want it,\nto cross over to Elis: I have twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not yet broken in, and I\nwant to bring one of them over here and break him.\u201d\nThey were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that Telemachus had not gone to the city of\nNeleus. They thought he was only away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with the swineherd; so\nAntinous said, \u201cWhen did he go? Tell me truly, and what young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or\nhis own bondsmen\u2014for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did you let him have the ship of your own free will\nbecause he asked you, or did he take it without yourleave?\u201d\n\u201cI lent it him,\u201d answered Noemon, \u201cwhat else could I do when a man of his position said he was in a difficulty,\nand asked me to oblige him? I could not possibly refuse. As for those who went with him they were the best young\nmen we have, and I saw Mentor go on board as captain\u2014or some god who was exactly like him. I cannot under-\nstand it, for I saw Mentor here myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting out for Pylos.\u201d\nNoemon then went back to his father\u2019s house, but Antinous and Eurymachus were very angry. They told the\nothers to leave off playing, and to come and sit down along with themselves. When they came, Antinous son of\nEupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:\n\u201cGood heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter; we had made sure that it would come to\nnothing, but the young fellow has got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be giving us trouble\npresently; may Jove take him before he is full grown. Find me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I\nwill lie in wait for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then rue the day that he set out to try and get\nnews of his father.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then all of them went inside the buildings.\nIt was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were plotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard\nthem from outside the outer court as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell his mistress. As he\ncrossed the threshold of her room Penelope said: \u201cMedon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the\nmaids to leave their master\u2019s business and cook dinner for them? I wish they may neither woo nor dine hencefor-\nward, neither here nor anywhere else, but let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of my son\u2019s estate.\nDid not your fathers tell you when you were children how good Ulysses had been to them\u2014never doing anything\nhigh-handed, nor speaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and they may take a fancy to\none man and dislike another, but Ulysses never did an unjust thing by anybody\u2014which shows what bad hearts you\nhave, and that there is no such thing as gratitude left in this world.\u201d\nThen Medon said, \u201cI wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are plotting something much more dreadful\nnow\u2014may heaven frustrate their design. They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming home from\nPylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get news of his father.\u201d\nThen Penelope\u2019s heart sank within her, and for a long time she was speechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she\ncould find no utterance. At last, however, she said, \u201cWhy did my son leave me? What business had he to go sailing\noff in ships that make long voyages over the ocean like sea-horses? Does he want to die without leaving any one\nbehind him to keep up his name?\u201d\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d answered Medon, \u201cwhether some god set him on to it, or whether he went on his own impulse\nto see if he could find out if his father was dead, or alive and on his way home.\u201d\nThen he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief. There were plenty of seats in the house,\nbut she. had no heart for sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor of her own room and\ncry; whereon all the maids in the house, both old and young, gathered round her and began to cry too, till at last in\na transport of sorrow she exclaimed,\n\u201cMy dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction than any other woman of my age and coun-\ntry. First I lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, and whose name was\ngreat over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my\nhaving heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was not one of you would so much as think of\ngiving me a call out of my bed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If I had known he meant\ntaking this voyage, he would have had to give it up, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse\nbehind him\u2014one or other. Now, however, go some of you and call old Dolius, who was given me by my father on\nmy marriage, and who is my gardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything to Laertes, who may be able to hit on\nsome plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side, as against those who are trying to exterminate his own race\nand that of Ulysses.\u201d\nThen the dear old nurse Euryclea said, \u201cYou may kill me, Madam, or let me live on in your house, whichever\n254 The Odyssey\nyou please, but I will tell you the real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted in the way of\nbread and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve\ndays, unless you asked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did not want you to spoil your beauty by\ncrying. And now, Madam, wash your face, change your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer prayers to\nMinerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save him even though he be in the jaws of death. Do not trou-\nble Laertes: he has trouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate die race of the race of the son\nof Arceisius so much, but there will be a son left to come up after him, and inherit both the house and the fair fields\nthat lie far all round it.\u201d\nWith these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried the tears from her eyes. Penelope washed\nher face, changed her dress, and went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley into a basket and\nbegan praying to Minerva.\n\u201cHear me,\u201d she cried, \u201cDaughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable. If ever Ulysses while he was here burned\nyou fat thigh bones of sheep or heifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and save my darling son from the vil-\nlainy of the suitors.\u201d\nShe cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer; meanwhile the suitors were clamorous\nthroughout the covered cloister, and one of them said:\n\u201cThe queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us. Little does she dream that her son has now\nbeen doomed to die.\u201d\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what was going to happen. Then Antinous said, \u201cComrades, let\nthere be no loud talking, lest some of it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in silence, about which we are all\nof a mind.\u201d\nHe then chose twenty men, and they went down to their. ship and to the sea side; they drew the vessel into the\nwater and got her mast and sails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all\nin due course, and spread the white sails aloft, while their fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made\nthe ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers, and waited till night should fall.\nBut Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink, and wondering whether her brave son would\nescape, or be overpowered by the wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen hemming her in\non every side she thought and thought till she sank into a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in the likeness of Penelope\u2019s sister Iphthime\ndaughter of Icarius who had married Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go to the house of Ulyss-\nes, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so it came into her room by the hole through which the thong went for\npulling the door to, and hovered over her head, saying,\n\u201cYou are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer you to weep and be so sad. Your son has done\nthem no wrong, so he will yet come back to you.\u201d\nPenelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered, \u201cSister, why have you come here? You\ndo not come very often, but I suppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to leave off crying\nand refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me? I, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had\nevery good quality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos; and now my darling\nson has gone off on board of a ship\u2014a foolish fellow who has never been used to roughing it, nor to going about\namong gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about him than about my husband; I am all in a tremble when I\nthink of him, lest something should happen to him, either from the people among whom he has gone, or by sea, for\nhe has many enemies who are plotting against him, and are bent on killing him before he can return home.\u201d\nThen the vision said, \u201cTake heart, and be not so much dismayed. There is one gone with him whom many a\nman would be glad enough to have stand by his side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion upon you, and\nwho has sent me to bear you this message.\u201d\n\u201cThen,\u201d said Penelope, \u201cif you are a god or have been sent here by divine commission, tell me also about that\nother unhappy one\u2014is he still alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?\u201d\nAnd the vision said, \u201cI shall not tell you for certain whether he is alive or dead, and there is no use in idle con-\nversation.\u201d\nThen it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated into thin air; but Penelope rose from\nher sleep refreshed and comforted, so vivid had been her dream.\nMeantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea, intent on murdering Telemachus. Now\nthere is a rocky islet called Asteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and there is a har-\nbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.\nBook V\n255 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAND NOW, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus\u2014harbinger of light alike to mortals and immor-\ntals\u2014the gods met in council and with them, Jove the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva began to\ntell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away there in the house of the nymph Calypso.\n\u201cFather Jove,\u201d said she, \u201cand all you other gods that live in everlasting bliss, I hope there may never be such a\nthing as a kind and well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope they will be all hence-\nforth cruel and unjust, for there is not one of his subjects but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled them as though he\nwere their father. There he is, lying in great pain in an island where dwells the nymph Calypso, who will not let him\ngo; and he cannot get back to his own country, for he can find neither ships nor sailors to take him over the sea.\nFurthermore, wicked people are now trying to murder his only son Telemachus, who is coming home from Pylos\nand Lacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can get news of his father.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, my dear, are you talking about?\u201d replied her father, \u201cdid you not send him there yourself, because you\nthought it would help Ulysses to get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to protect Telema-\nchus, and to see him safely home again, while the suitors have to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed\nhim.\u201d\nWhen he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, \u201cMercury, you are our messenger, go therefore and tell\nCalypso we have decreed that poor Ulysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor men, but\nafter a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to reach fertile Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians, who are\nnear of kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he were one of ourselves. They will send him in a ship to\nhis own country, and will give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back from Troy,\nif he had had had all his prize money and had got home without disaster. This is how we have settled that he shall\nreturn to his country and his friends.\u201d\nThus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as he was told. Forthwith he bound on\nhis glittering golden sandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand with which\nhe seals men\u2019s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he\nswooped down through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormo-\nrant that flies fishing every hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. He flew and\nflew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the island which was his journey\u2019s end, he left the sea and\nwent on by land till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.\nHe found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and one could smell from far the fra-\ngrant reek of burning cedar and sandal wood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden shuttle\nthrough the warp and singing beautifully. Round her cave there was a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smell-\ning cypress trees, wherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests\u2014owls, hawks, and chattering sea-crows that\noccupy their business in the waters. A vine loaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth\nof the cave; there were also four running rills of water in channels cut pretty close together, and turned hither and\nthither so as to irrigate the beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed. Even a god could not help\nbeing charmed with such a lovely spot, so Mercury stood still and looked at it; but when he had admired it suffi-\nciently he went inside the cave.\nCalypso knew him at once\u2014for the gods all know each other, no matter how far they live from one another\u2014\nbut Ulysses was not within; he was on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears in his\neyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso gave Mercury a seat and said: \u201cWhy have you come to see\nme, Mercury\u2014honoured, and ever welcome\u2014for you do not visit me often? Say what you want; I will do it for be\nyou at once if I can, and if it can be done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before you.\nAs she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed him some red nectar, so Mercury ate\nand drank till he had had enough, and then said:\n\u201cWe are speaking god and goddess to one another, one another, and you ask me why I have come here, and I\nwill tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove sent me; it was no doing of mine; who could possibly want to come\nall this way over the sea where there are no cities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nev-\nertheless I had to come, for none of us other gods can cross Jove, nor transgress his orders. He says that you have\nhere the most ill-starred of alf those who fought nine years before the city of King Priam and sailed home in the\ntenth year after having sacked it. On their way home they sinned against Minerva, who raised both wind and waves\nagainst them, so that all his brave companions perished, and he alone was carried hither by wind and tide. Jove says\nthat you are to let this by man go at once, for it is decreed that he shall not perish here, far from his own people, but\nshall return to his house and country and see his friends again.\u201d\nCalypso trembled with rage when she heard this, \u201cYou gods,\u201d she exclaimed, to be ashamed of yourselves. You\nare always jealous and hate seeing a goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with him in open matrimony. So\nwhen rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion, you precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed\nhim in Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion, and yielded to him in a thrice ploughed fallow field,\n256 The Odyssey\nJove came to hear of it before so long and killed Iasion with his thunder-bolts. And now you are angry with me too\nbecause I have a man here. I found the poor creature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his ship\nwith lightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while he himself was driven by wind\nand waves on to my island. I got fond of him and cherished him, and had set my heart on making him immortal,\nso that he should never grow old all his days; still I cannot cross Jove, nor bring his counsels to nothing; therefore,\nif he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him anywhere myself for I have neither\nships nor men who can take him. Nevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in all good faith, as will be likely\nto bring him safely to his own country.\u201d\n\u201cThen send him away,\u201d said Mercury, \u201cor Jove will be angry with you and punish you\u201d\u2019\nOn this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses, for she had heard Jove\u2019s message. She found\nhim sitting upon the beach with his eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer home-sickness; for he had got\ntired of Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep with her in the cave by night, it was she, not he, that would have\nit so. As for the day time, he spent it on the rocks and on the sea-shore, weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and\nalways looking out upon the sea. Calypso then went close up to him said:\n\u201cMy poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life out any longer. I am going to send you\naway of my own free will; so go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an upper deck that it\nmay carry you safely over the sea. I will put bread, wine, and water on board to save you from starving. I will also\ngive you clothes, and will send you a fair wind to take you home, if the gods in heaven so will it\u2014or they know\nmore about these things, and can settle them better than I can.\u201d\nUlysses shuddered as he heard her. \u201cNow goddess,\u201d he answered, \u201cthere is something behind all this; you cannot\nbe really meaning to help me home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft. Not even a\nwell-found ship with a fair wind could venture on such a distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall mage\nme go on board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no mischief.\u201d\nCalypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: \u201cYou know a great deal,\u201d said she, \u201cbut you are quite\nwrong here. May heaven above and earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx\u2014and this is the\nmost solemn oath which a blessed god can take\u2014that I mean you no sort of harm, and am only advising you to do\nexactly what I should do myself in your place. I am dealing with you quite straightforwardly; my heart is not made\nof iron, and I am very sorry for you.\u201d\nWhen she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and Ulysses followed in her steps; so the pair,\ngoddess and man, went on and on till they came to Calypso\u2019s cave, where Ulysses took the seat that Mercury had\njust left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of the food that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and\nnectar for herself, and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them. When they had satisfied\nthemselves with meat and drink, Calypso spoke, saying:\n\u201cUlysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your own land at once? Good luck go with you, but\nif you could only know how much suffering is in store for you before you get back to your own country, you would\nstay where you are, keep house along with me, and let me make you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be\nto see this wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day; yet I flatter myself that at am no whit\nless tall or well-looking than she is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should compare in beauty with\nan immortal.\u201d\n\u201cGoddess,\u201d replied Ulysses, \u201cdo not be angry with me about this. I am quite aware that my wife Penelope is\nnothing like so tall or so beautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal. Nevertheless,\nI want to get home, and can think of nothing else. If some god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and\nmake the best of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and sea already, so let this go with the rest.\u201d\nPresently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into the inner part of the cave and went to\nbed.\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Ulysses put on his shirt and cloak, while the god-\ndess wore a dress of a light gossamer fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about her waist\nand a veil to cover her head. She at once set herself to think how she could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave\nhim a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle\nfitted firmly on to it. She also gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of the island where the\nlargest trees grew\u2014alder, poplar and pine, that reached the sky\u2014very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for\nhim in the water. Then, when she had shown him where the best trees grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut\nthem, which he soon finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring them by\nrule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them\nand fitted the timbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled shipwright makes the\nbeam of a large vessel, and he filed a deck on top of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast\nwith a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a protection against\n257 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthe waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. By and by Calypso brought him some linen to make the sails,\nand he made these too, excellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last of all, with the help of levers, he\ndrew the raft down into the water.\nIn four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso sent him from the island after washing\nhim and giving him some clean clothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another larger one of water;\nshe also gave him a wallet full of provisions, and found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind\nfair and warm for him, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail before it, while he sat and guided the raft skilfully by\nmeans of the rudder. He never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting Bootes, and on the\nBear\u2014which men also call the wain, and which turns round and round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never\ndipping into the stream of Oceanus\u2014for Calypso had told him to keep this to his left. Days seven and ten did he\nsail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast\nappeared, rising like a shield on the horizon.\nBut King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight of Ulysses a long way off, from the\nmountains of the Solymi. He could see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged his head\nand muttered to himself, saying, heavens, so the gods have been changing their minds about Ulysses while I was\naway in Ethiopia, and now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed that he shall escape from the\ncalamities that have befallen him. Still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done with it.\u201d\nThereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred it round in the sea, and roused the rage\nof every wind that blows till earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of the heavens.\nWinds from East, South, North, and West fell upon him all at the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that\nUlysses\u2019 heart began to fail him. \u201cAlas,\u201d he said to himself in his dismay, \u201cwhat ever will become of me? I am afraid\nCalypso was right when she said I should have trouble by sea before I got back home. It is all coming true. How\nblack is Jove making heaven with his clouds, and what a sea the winds are raising from every quarter at once. I am\nnow safe to perish. Blest and thrice blest were those Danaans who fell before Troy in the cause of the sons of Atreus.\nWould that had been killed on the day when the Trojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achil-\nles, for then I should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured my name; but now it seems that I\nshall come to a most pitiable end.\u201d\nAs he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft reeled again, and he was carried overboard\na long way off. He let go the helm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that it broke the mast half way up,\nand both sail and yard went over into the sea. For a long time Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could do to\nrise to the surface again, for the clothes Calypso had given him weighed him down; but at last he got his head above\nwater and spat out the bitter brine that was running down his face in streams. In spite of all this, however, he did\nnot lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast as he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to\nescape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn winds whirl thistledown round and round\nupon a road. It was as though the South, North, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and shuttlecock\nwith it at once.\nWhen he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called Leucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a\nmere mortal, but had been since raised to the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great distress Ulysses now\nwas, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft.\n\u201cMy poor good man,\u201d said she, \u201cwhy is Neptune so furiously angry with you? He is giving you a great deal of\ntrouble, but for all his bluster he will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as I bid you; strip, leave\nyour raft to drive before the wind, and swim to the Phaecian coast where better luck awaits you. And here, take my\nveil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can come to no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as\nyou touch land take it off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then go away again.\u201d With these words\nshe took off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue\nwaters.\nBut Ulysses did not know what to think. \u201cAlas,\u201d he said to himself in his dismay, \u201cthis is only some one or other\nof the gods who is luring me to ruin by advising me to will quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so at present, for\nthe land where she said I should be quit of all troubles seemed to be still a good way off. I know what I will do\u2014I\nam sure it will be best\u2014no matter what happens I will stick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but\nwhen the sea breaks her up I will swim for it; I do not see how I can do any better than this.\u201d\nWhile he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave that seemed to rear itself above his head\ntill it broke right over the raft, which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed about by a\nwhirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon it as if he were on horseback; he then took off the clothes\nCalypso had given him, bound Ino\u2019s veil under his arms, and plunged into the sea\u2014meaning to swim on shore.\nKing Neptune watched him as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying, \u201c\u2019There now, swim\nup and down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-do people. I do not think you will be able to say that I have\n258 The Odyssey\nlet you off too lightly.\u201d On this he lashed his horses and drove to Aegae where his palace is.\nBut Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all the winds except one, and made them lie\nquite still; but she roused a good stiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses reached the land\nof the Phaeacians where he would be safe.\nThereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water, with a heavy swell on the sea and death\nstaring him in the face; but when the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so much\nas a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as\nchildren rejoice when their dear father begins to get better after having for a long time borne sore affliction sent\nhim by some angry spirit, but the gods deliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful when he again saw land and\ntrees, and swam on with all his strength that he might once more set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he got\nwithin earshot, he began to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell still broke against them with\na terrific roar. Everything was enveloped in spray; there were no harbours where a ship might ride, nor shelter of\nany kind, but only headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.\nUlysses\u2019 heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to himself, \u201cAlas, Jove has let me see land after\nswimming so far that I had given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast is rocky and surf-beaten,\nthe rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea, with deep water close under them so that I cannot climb out for\nwant of foothold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me off my legs and dash me against the rocks as I leave the\nwater\u2014which would give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further in search of some shelving beach\nor harbour, a hurricane may carry me out to sea again sorely against my will, or heaven may send some great mon-\nster of the deep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that Neptune is very angry with me.\u201d\nWhile he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such force against the rocks that he\nwould have been smashed and torn to pieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the rock\nwith both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till the wave retired, so he was saved that time; but presently the\nwave came on again and carried him back with it far into the sea-tearing his hands as the suckers of a polypus are\ntorn when some one plucks it from its bed, and the stones come up along with it even so did the rocks tear the skin\nfrom his strong hands, and then the wave drew him deep down under the water.\nHere poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his own destiny, if Minerva had not helped\nhim to keep his wits about him. He swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating against the land,\nand at the same time he kept looking towards the shore to see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take\nthe waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of a river, and here he thought would be the best\nplace, for there were no rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there was a current, so he prayed\ninwardly and said:\n\u201cHear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the sea-god Neptune, for I approach\nyou prayerfully. Any one who has lost his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my distress\nI draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees of your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare\nmyself your suppliant.\u201d\nThen the god stayed his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm before him, and bringing him safely into\nthe mouth of the river. Here at last Ulysses\u2019 knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had completely broken\nhim. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he could\nneither breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently, when he had got his breath and came\nto himself again, he took off the scarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the salt stream of the river,\nwhereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that bore it towards her. Then he left the river, laid himself\ndown among the rushes, and kissed the bounteous earth.\n\u201cAlas,\u201d he cried to himself in his dismay, \u201cwhat ever will become of me, and how is it all to end? If I stay here\nupon the river bed through the long watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the bitter cold and damp may\nmake an end of me\u2014for towards sunrise there will be a keen wind blowing from off the river. If, on the other hand,\nI climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some thicket, I may escape the cold and have a good\nnight\u2019s rest, but some savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me.\u201d\nIn the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one upon some high ground not far from the\nwater. There he crept beneath two shoots of olive that grew from a single stock\u2014the one an ungrafted sucker, while\nthe other had been grafted. No wind, however squally, could break through the cover they afforded, nor could the\nsun\u2019s rays pierce them, nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow into one another. Ulysses crept un-\nder these and began to make himself a bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying about\u2014enough\nto make a covering for two or three men even in hard winter weather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid\nhimself down and heaped the leaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in the country, far from any neigh-\nbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere, even so did Ulysses\ncover himself up with leaves; and Minerva shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose\n259 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nall memories of his sorrows.\nBook VI\nSO HERE Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off to the country and city of the Phae-\ncians\u2014a people who used to live in the fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes were\nstronger than they and plundered them, so their king Nausithous moved them thence and settled them in Sche-\nria, far from all other people. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and temples, and divided the lands\namong his people; but he was dead and gone to the house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were\ninspired of heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did Minerva hie in furtherance of the return of Ulysses.\nShe went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there slept a girl who was as lovely as a\ngoddess, Nausicaa, daughter to King Alcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty, one on\neither side of the doorway, which was closed with well-made folding doors. Minerva took the form of the famous\nsea captain Dymas\u2019s daughter, who was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up to the\ngirl\u2019s bedside like a breath of wind, she hovered over her head and said:\n\u201cNausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy daughter? Here are your clothes all lying\nin disorder, yet you are going to be married almost immediately, and should not only be well dressed yourself, but\nshould find good clothes for those who attend you. This is the way to get yourself a good name, and to make your\nfather and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a washing day, and start at daybreak. I will\ncome and help you so that you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best young men among\nyour own people are courting you, and you are not going to remain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore,\nto have a waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and girdles; and you can ride, too,\nwhich will be much pleasanter for you than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some way from the town.\u201d\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they say is the everlasting home of the gods.\nHere no wind beats roughly, and neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine and in a great\npeacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are illumined for ever and ever. This was the place to which the god-\ndess went when she had given instructions to the girl.\nBy and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering about her dream; she therefore went to the\nother end of the house to tell her father and mother all about it, and found them in their own room. Her mother\nwas sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her maids around her, and she happened to catch her fa-\nther just as he was going out to attend a meeting of the town council, which the Phaeacian aldermen had convened.\nShe stopped him and said:\n\u201cPapa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? I want to take all our dirty clothes to the river\nand wash them. You are the chief man here, so it is only right that you should have a clean shirt when you attend\nmeetings of the council. Moreover, you have five sons at home, two of them married, while the other three are\ngood-looking bachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen when they go to a dance, and I have been\nthinking about all this.\u201d\nShe did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like to, but her father knew and said, \u201cYou shall\nhave the mules, my love, and whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the men shall get you a good\nstrong waggon with a body to it that will hold all your clothes.\u201d\nOn this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon out, harnessed the mules, and put them to, while\nthe girl brought the clothes down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her mother prepared her\na basket of provisions with all sorts of good things, and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon,\nand her mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil, that she and her women might anoint themselves. Then she took\nthe whip and reins and lashed the mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered on the road. They pulled\nwithout flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa and her wash of clothes, but the maids also who were with her.\nWhen they reached the water side they went to the washing-cisterns, through which there ran at all times\nenough pure water to wash any quantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the mules and turned\nthem out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the water side. They took the clothes out of the waggon,\nput them in the water, and vied with one another in treading them in the pits to get the dirt out. After they had\nwashed them and got them quite clean, they laid them out by the sea side, where the waves had raised a high beach\nof shingle, and set about washing themselves and anointing themselves with olive oil. Then they got their dinner by\nthe side of the stream, and waited for the sun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done dinner they threw\noff the veils that covered their heads and began to play at ball, while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Diana\ngoes forth upon the mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer, and the wood-nymphs,\ndaughters of Aegis-bearing Jove, take their sport along with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter stand a\nfull head taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest amid a whole bevy of beauties), even so did the girl out-\n260 The Odyssey\nshine her handmaids.\nWhen it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the clothes and putting them into the waggon,\nMinerva began to consider how Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct him to\nthe city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball at one of the maids, which missed her and fell into deep\nwater. On this they all shouted, and the noise they made woke Ulysses, who sat up in his bed of leaves and began to\nwonder what it might all be.\n\u201cAlas,\u201d said he to himself, \u201cwhat kind of people have I come amongst? Are they cruel, savage, and uncivilized, or\nhospitable and humane? I seem to hear the voices of young women, and they sound like those of the nymphs that\nhaunt mountain tops, or springs of rivers and meadows of green grass. At any rate I am among a race of men and\nwomen. Let me try if I cannot manage to get a look at them.\u201d\nAs he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough covered with thick leaves to hide his naked-\nness. He looked like some lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength and defying both wind\nand rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest of oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even\ninto a well-fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep\u2014even such did Ulysses seem to the young women, as he\ndrew near to them all naked as he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one so unkempt and so begrimed with\nsalt water, the others scampered off along the spits that jutted out into the sea, but the daughter of Alcinous stood\nfirm, for Minerva put courage into her heart and took away all fear from her. She stood right in front of Ulysses,\nand he doubted whether he should go up to her, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees as a suppliant,\nor stay where he was and entreat her to give him some clothes and show him the way to the town. In the end he\ndeemed it best to entreat her from a distance in case the girl should take offence at his coming near enough to clasp\nher knees, so he addressed her in honeyed and persuasive language.\n\u201cO queen,\u201d he said, \u201cI implore your aid\u2014but tell me, are you a goddess or are you a mortal woman? If you are\na goddess and dwell in heaven, I can only conjecture that you are Jove\u2019s daughter Diana, for your face and figure\nresemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are a mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are your father and\nmother\u2014thrice happy, too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and delighted they must feel when they see so\nfair a scion as yourself going out to a dance; most happy, however, of all will he be whose wedding gifts have been\nthe richest, and who takes you to his own home. I never yet saw any one so beautiful, neither man nor woman,\nand am lost in admiration as I behold you. I can only compare you to a young palm tree which I saw when I was at\nDelos growing near the altar of Apollo\u2014for I was there, too, with much people after me, when I was on that jour-\nney which has been the source of all my troubles. Never yet did such a young plant shoot out of the ground as that\nwas, and I admired and wondered at it exactly as I now admire and wonder at yourself. I dare not clasp your knees,\nbut I am in great distress; yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been tossing about upon the sea. The winds\nand waves have taken me all the way from the Ogygian island, and now fate has flung me upon this coast that I may\nendure still further suffering; for I do not think that I have yet come to the end of it, but rather that heaven has still\nmuch evil in store for me.\n\u201cAnd now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I have met, and I know no one else in this\ncountry. Show me the way to your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither to wrap your\nclothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart\u2019s desire\u2014husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for\nthere is nothing better in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a house. It discomfits their\nenemies, makes the hearts of their friends glad, and they themselves know more about it than any one.\u201d\nTo this Nausicaa answered, \u201cStranger, you appear to be a sensible, well-disposed person. There is no account-\ning for luck; Jove gives prosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what he has seen fit to send\nyou, and make the best of it. Now, however, that you have come to this our country, you shall not want for clothes\nnor for anything else that a foreigner in distress may reasonably look for. I will show you the way to the town, and\nwill tell you the name of our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I am daughter to Alcinous, in whom the whole\npower of the state is vested.\u201d\nThen she called her maids and said, \u201cStay where you are, you girls. Can you not see a man without running\naway from him? Do you take him for a robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do us\nPhaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on a land\u2019s end that juts into the sounding sea, and\nhave nothing to do with any other people. This is only some poor man who has lost his way, and we must be kind\nto him, for strangers and foreigners in distress are under Jove\u2019s protection, and will take what they can get and be\nthankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something to eat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some place that is\nsheltered from the wind.\u201d\nOn this the maids left off running away and began calling one another back. They made Ulysses sit down in the\nshelter as Nausicaa had told them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the little golden cruse\nof oil, and told him to go wash in the stream. But Ulysses said, \u201cYoung women, please to stand a little on one side\nthat I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil, for it is long enough since my skin has had\n261 Compact Anthology of World Literature\na drop of oil upon it. I cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am ashamed to strip before a number of\ngood-looking young women.\u201d\nThen they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses washed himself in the stream and scrubbed\nthe brine from his back and from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and had got the\nbrine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil, and put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva\nthen made him look taller and stronger than before, she also made the hair grow thick on the top of his head, and\nflow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a skilful workman\nwho has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it\u2014and his\nwork is full of beauty. Then he went and sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young and hand-\nsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said to her maids:\n\u201cHush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who live in heaven have sent this man to the\nPhaeacians. When I first saw him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of the gods who dwell in\nheaven. I should like my future husband to be just such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want to\ngo away. However, give him something to eat and drink.\u201d\nThey did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and drank ravenously, for it was long since\nhe had had food of any kind. Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen folded and\nplaced in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she took her seat, she called Ulysses:\n\u201cStranger,\u201d said she, \u201crise and let us be going back to the town; I will introduce you at the house of my excellent\nfather, where I can tell you that you will meet all the best people among the Phaecians. But be sure and do as I bid\nyou, for you seem to be a sensible person. As long as we are going past the fields\u2014and farm lands, follow briskly\nbehind the waggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself. Presently, however, we shall come to the\ntown, where you will find a high wall running all round it, and a good harbour on either side with a narrow en-\ntrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn up by the road side, for every one has a place where his own ship\ncan lie. You will see the market place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it, and paved with large stones\nbedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship\u2019s gear of all kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places\nwhere oars are made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers; they know nothing about bows and arrows, but\nare a sea-faring folk, and pride themselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which they travel far over the sea.\n\u201cI am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against me later on; for the people here are very\nill-natured, and some low fellow, if he met us, might say, \u2018Who is this fine-looking stranger that is going about with\nNausicaa? Where did she End him? I suppose she is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she\nhas taken from some foreign vessel, for we have no neighbours; or some god has at last come down from heaven in\nanswer to her prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of her life. It would be a good thing if she would\ntake herself of I for she and find a husband somewhere else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent young\nPhaeacians who are in with her.\u2019 This is the kind of disparaging remark that would be made about me, and I could\nnot complain, for I should myself be scandalized at seeing any other girl do the like, and go about with men in spite\nof everybody, while her father and mother were still alive, and without having been married in the face of all the\nworld.\n\u201cIf, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help you home, do as I bid you; you will see a\nbeautiful grove of poplars by the road side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow all round it. Here\nmy father has a field of rich garden ground, about as far from the town as a man\u2019 voice will carry. Sit down there and\nwait for a while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach my father\u2019s house. Then, when you think we must\nhave done this, come into the town and ask the way to the house of my father Alcinous. You will have no difficulty\nin finding it; any child will point it out to you, for no one else in the whole town has anything like such a fine house\nas he has. When you have got past the gates and through the outer court, go right across the inner court till you\ncome to my mother. You will find her sitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by firelight. It is a fine sight\nto see her as she leans back against one of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind her. Close to her seat\nstands that of my father, on which he sits and topes like an immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to my moth-\ner, and lay your hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If you can gain her over, you may hope to see\nyour own country again, no matter how distant it may be.\u201d\nSo saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river. The mules drew well and their hoofs went\nup and down upon the road. She was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were following on\nfoot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip with judgement. As the sun was going down they came to the\nsacred grove of Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter of Jove.\n\u201cHear me,\u201d he cried, \u201cdaughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, hear me now, for you gave no heed to my\nprayers when Neptune was wrecking me. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends and\nbe hospitably received by the Phaecians.\u201d\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not show herself to him openly, for she was\n262 The Odyssey\nafraid of her uncle Neptune, who was still furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting home.\nBook VII\nTHUS, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the town. When she reached her father\u2019s house\nshe drew up at the gateway, and her brothers\u2014comely as the gods\u2014gathered round her, took the mules out of the\nwaggon, and carried the clothes into the house, while she went to her own room, where an old servant, Eurymedusa\nof Apeira, lit the fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira, and had been chosen as a prize\nfor Alcinous because he was king over the Phaecians, and the people obeyed him as though he were a god. She had\nbeen nurse to Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for her, and brought her supper for her into her own room.\nPresently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed a thick mist all round him to hide him in\ncase any of the proud Phaecians who met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was. Then, as he was just\nentering the town, she came towards him in the likeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front of\nhim, and Ulysses said:\n\u201cMy dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous? I am an unfortunate foreigner in dis-\ntress, and do not know one in your town and country.\u201d\nThen Minerva said, \u201cYes, father stranger, I will show you the house you want, for Alcinous lives quite close to\nmy own father. I will go before you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look at any man,\nnor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide strangers, and do not like men who come from some other\nplace. They are a sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships that glide along like thought, or\nas a bird in the air.\u201d\nOn this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one of the Phaecians could see him as he\npassed through the city in the midst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards him had hid-\nden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their harbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the\ncity, which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when they reached the king\u2019s house Minerva\nsaid:\n\u201cThis is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you. You will find a number of great people\nsitting at table, but do not be afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is to carry his point,\neven though he is a stranger. First find the queen. Her name is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her hus-\nband Alcinous. They both descend originally from Neptune, who was father to Nausithous by Periboea, a woman\nof great beauty. Periboea was the youngest daughter of Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over the giants, but he\nruined his ill-fated people and lost his own life to boot.\n\u201cNeptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him, the great Nausithous, who reigned over\nthe Phaecians. Nausithous had two sons Rhexenor and Alcinous; Apollo killed the first of them while he was still a\nbridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter Arete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as no other\nwoman is honoured of all those that keep house along with their husbands.\n\u201cThus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her children, by Alcinous himself, and by the\nwhole people, who look upon her as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for she is a thor-\noughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any women are friends of hers, she will help their husbands\nalso to settle their disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope of seeing your friends again,\nand getting safely back to your home and country.\u201d\nThen Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to Marathon and to the spacious streets of\nAthens, where she entered the abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous, and he pondered\nmuch as he paused a while before reaching the threshold of bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of\nthe sun or moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end, and the cornice was of blue enamel. The\ndoors were gold, and hung on pillars of silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver and the\nhook of the door was of gold.\nOn either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with his consummate skill, had fashioned ex-\npressly to keep watch over the palace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow old. Seats were\nranged all along the wall, here and there from one end to the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the\nwomen of the house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaecians used to sit and eat and drink, for there was\nabundance at all seasons; and there were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in their hands, raised\non pedestals, to give light by night to those who were at table. There are fifty maid servants in the house, some of\nwhom are always grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom, or sit and spin, and their\nshuttles go, backwards and forwards like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely woven that it will\nturn oil. As the Phaecians are the best sailors in the world, so their women excel all others in weaving, for Minerva\nhas taught them all manner of useful arts, and they are very intelligent.\n263 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nOutside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about four acres with a wall all round it. It is full\nof beautiful trees\u2014pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are luscious figs also, and olives in\nfull growth. The fruits never rot nor fail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so soft that a\nnew crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on pear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with\nthe grapes, for there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this, the grapes are being made into\nraisins; in another part they are being gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on have\nshed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again are just changing colour. In the furthest part of the\nground there are beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year round. Two streams go through\nit, the one turned in ducts throughout the whole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the outer\ncourt to the house itself, and the town\u2019s people draw water from it. Such, then, were the splendours with which the\ngods had endowed the house of king Alcinous.\nSo here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he had looked long enough he crossed the\nthreshold and went within the precincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the Phaecians\nmaking their drink-offerings to Mercury, which they always did the last thing before going away for the night. He\nwent straight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness in which Minerva had enveloped him, till\nhe reached Arete and King Alcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at that moment the\nmiraculous darkness fell away from him and he became visible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a\nman there, but Ulysses began at once with his petition.\n\u201cQueen Arete,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cdaughter of great Rhexenor, in my distress I humbly pray you, as also your\nhusband and these your guests (whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they leave their\npossessions to their children, and all the honours conferred upon them by the state) to help me home to my own\ncountry as soon as possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my friends.\u201d\nThen he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their peace, till presently the old hero Eche-\nneus, who was an excellent speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty addressed them\nthus:\n\u201cAlcinous,\u201d said he, \u201cit is not creditable to you that a stranger should be seen sitting among the ashes of your\nhearth; every one is waiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and take a seat on a stool inlaid\nwith silver, and bid your servants mix some wine and water that we may make a drink-offering to Jove the lord of\nthunder, who takes all well-disposed suppliants under his protection; and let the housekeeper give him some sup-\nper, of whatever there may be in the house.\u201d\nWhen Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from the hearth, and bade him take the seat\nof Laodamas, who had been sitting beside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then brought him water\nin a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table\nbeside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many good things of what there was in the house,\nand Ulysses ate and drank. Then Alcinous said to one of the servants, \u201cPontonous, mix a cup of wine and hand it\nround that we may make drink-offerings to Jove the lord of thunder, who is the protector of all well-disposed sup-\npliants.\u201d\nPontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering. When\nthey had made their offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:\n\u201cAldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You have had your supper, so now go home\nto bed. To-morrow morning I shall invite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial banquet in\nhonour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his escort, and consider how we may at once send him\nback rejoicing to his own country without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no matter how distant it may be.\nWe must see that he comes to no harm while on his homeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have\nto take the luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is possible, however, that the stranger is\none of the immortals who has come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods are departing from their\nusual practice, for hitherto they have made themselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them hec-\natombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves, and if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble\nupon some one or other of them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the gods as the Cyclopes\nand the savage giants are.\u201d\nThen Ulysses said: \u201cPray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into your head. I have nothing of the immortal\nabout me, neither in body nor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted. Indeed, were\nI to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me, you would say that I was still worse off than they are. Never-\ntheless, let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very importunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man\u2019s\nnotice no matter how dire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I shall eat and drink, bids me lay\naside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you pro-\npose, and at break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content to die if I may first once more behold\n264 The Odyssey\nmy property, my bondsmen, and all the greatness of my house.\u201d\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he\nhad spoken reasonably. Then when they had made their drink-offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was\nminded they went home to bed every man in his own abode, leaving Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alci-\nnous while the servants were taking the things away after supper. Arete was the first to speak, for she recognized\nthe shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said,\n\u201cStranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should like to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who\ngave you those clothes? Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?\u201d\nAnd Ulysses answered, \u201cIt would be a long story Madam, were I to relate in full the tale of my misfortunes, for\nthe hand of heaven has been laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island far away in the sea\nwhich is called \u2018the Ogygian.\u2019 Here dwells the cunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives\nby herself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however, me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for\nJove struck my ship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades were drowned every\nman of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during\nthe darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island where the great goddess Calypso lives.\nShe took me in and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I might\nnever grow old, but she could not persuade me to let her do so.\n\u201cI stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good clothes she gave me with my tears\nduring the whole time; but at last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will, either\nbecause Jove had told her she must, or because she had changed her mind. She sent me from her island on a raft,\nwhich she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good stout clothing, and sent me\na wind that blew both warm and fair. Days seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught sight\nof the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast\u2014and glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless\nthere was still much trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no further, and raised a great\nstorm against me; the sea was so terribly high that I could no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the\nfury of the gale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your shores.\n\u201cThere I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the waves dashed me against the rocks, so I\nagain took to the sea and swam on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for there were no\nrocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I got out of the water and gathered my senses together again.\nNight was coming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I covered myself all over with leaves, and\npresently heaven sent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all night, and\nthrough the next day till afternoon, when I woke as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter\u2019s maid servants\nplaying upon the beach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought her aid, and she proved\nto be of an excellent disposition, much more so than could be expected from so young a person\u2014for young people\nare apt to be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she had had me washed in the river she\nalso gave me the clothes in which you see me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told you the\nwhole truth.\u201d\nThen Alcinous said, \u201cStranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to bring you on at once to my house along\nwith the maids, seeing that she was the first person whose aid you asked.\u201d\n\u201cPray do not scold her,\u201d replied Ulysses; \u201cshe is not to blame. She did tell me to follow along with the maids,\nbut I was ashamed and afraid, for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human being is\nsometimes a little suspicious and irritable.\u201d\n\u201cStranger,\u201d replied Alcinous, \u201cI am not the kind of man to get angry about nothing; it is always better to be rea-\nsonable; but by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, and how much you\nthink as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter, and become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give\nyou a house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here against your own wish, and that you may\nbe sure of this I will attend to-morrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep during the whole voyage if you\nlike, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to your own home, or wherever you please, even though\nit be a long way further off than Euboea, which those of my people who saw it when they took yellow-haired Rha-\ndamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place\u2014and yet they did the whole voyage in\na single day without distressing themselves, and came back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships\nexcel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.\u201d\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, \u201cFather Jove, grant that Alcinous may do all as he has said, for\nso he will win an imperishable name among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.\u201d\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the room that was in the gatehouse, and make\nit with good red rugs, and to spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to wear. The maids\nthereon went out with torches in their hands, and when they had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and said,\n265 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u201cRise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,\u201d and glad indeed was he to go to his rest.\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; but Alcinous lay in the inner part of the\nhouse, with the queen his wife by his side.\nBook VIII\nNOW when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous and Ulysses both rose, and Alci-\nnous led the way to the Phaecian place of assembly, which was near the ships. When they got there they sat down\nside by side on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took the form of one of Alcinous\u2019 servants, and went round\nthe town in order to help Ulysses to get home. She went up to the citizens, man by man, and said, \u201cAldermen and\ntown councillors of the Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger who has just come off\na long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks like an immortal god.\u201d\nWith these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to the assembly till seats and standing\nroom were alike crowded. Every one was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified him\nabout the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter than he really was, that he might impress the\nPhaecians favourably as being a very remarkable man, and might come off well in the many trials of skill to which\nthey would challenge him. Then, when they were got together, Alcinous spoke:\n\u201cHear me,\u201d said he, \u201caldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, that I may speak even as I am minded.\nThis stranger, whoever he may be, has found his way to my house from somewhere or other either East or West. He\nwants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled. Let us then get one ready for him, as we have done for others\nbefore him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to complain of me for not speeding on\nhis way soon enough. Let us draw a ship into the sea\u2014one that has never yet made a voyage\u2014and man her with\ntwo and fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you have made fast your oars each by his own seat, leave the\nship and come to my house to prepare a feast. I will find you in everything. I am giving will these instructions to the\nyoung men who will form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councillors, you will join me in enter-\ntaining our guest in the cloisters. I can take no excuses, and we will have Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no\nbard like him whatever he may choose to sing about.\u201d\nAlcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a servant went to fetch Demodocus. The fif-\nty-two picked oarsmen went to the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew the ship into\nthe water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in\ndue course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a little way out from land, and then came on\nshore and went to the house of King Alcinous. The outhouses, yards, and all the precincts were filled with crowds\nof men in great multitudes both old and young; and Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and\ntwo oxen. These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent banquet.\nA servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had dearly loved, but to whom she\nhad given both good and evil, for though she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of\nhis eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre\nfor him on a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands. He also set a fair table\nwith a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed.\nThe company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before them, but as soon as they had had\nenough to eat and drink, the muse inspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a matter\nthat was then in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel between Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that\nthey heaped on one another as they gat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad when he heard his chief-\ntains quarrelling with one another, for Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor to\nconsult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by the will of Jove fell both Danaans and Trojans.\nThus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head and covered his face, for he was ashamed\nto let the Phaeacians see that he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from his eyes,\nuncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed De-\nmodocus to sing further, for they delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept\nbitterly. No one noticed his distress except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that he\nwas heaving. So he at once said, \u201cAldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both\nof the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports, so\nthat our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as boxers,\nwrestlers, jumpers, and runners.\u201d\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A servant hung Demodocus\u2019s lyre on its peg for\nhim, led him out of the cloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief men of the Phaea-\ncians were going to see the sports; a crowd of several thousands of people followed them, and there were many\n266 The Odyssey\nexcellent competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus,\nPonteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus, and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also Euryalus son\nof Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking man among the Phaecians except Laodamas.\nThree sons of Alcinous, Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, competed also.\nThe foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the starting post, and they raised a dust upon\nthe plain as they all flew forward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he left every one else\nbehind him by the length of the furrow that a couple of mules can plough in a fallow field. They then turned to the\npainful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be the best man. Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping,\nwhile at throwing the disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous\u2019s son Laodamas was the best\nboxer, and he it was who presently said, when they had all been diverted with the games, \u201cLet us ask the stranger\nwhether he excels in any of these sports; he seems very powerfully built; his thighs, claves, hands, and neck are of\nprodigious strength, nor is he at all old, but he has suffered much lately, and there is nothing like the sea for making\nhavoc with a man, no matter how strong he is.\u201d\n\u201cYou are quite right, Laodamas,\u201d replied Euryalus, \u201cgo up to your guest and speak to him about it yourself.\u201d\nWhen Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd and said to Ulysses, \u201cI hope, Sir, that\nyou will enter yourself for some one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of them\u2014and you must\nhave gone in for many a one before now. There is nothing that does any one so much credit all his life long as the\nshowing himself a proper man with his hands and feet. Have a try therefore at something, and banish all sorrow\nfrom your mind. Your return home will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the water, and the\ncrew is found.\u201d\nUlysses answered, \u201cLaodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind is set rather on cares than contests;\nI have been through infinite trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and people to\nfurther me on my return home.\u201d\nThen Euryalus reviled him outright and said, \u201cI gather, then, that you are unskilled in any of the many sports\nthat men generally delight in. I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships as captains or\nmerchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to\nbe much of the athlete about you.\u201d\n\u201cFor shame, Sir,\u201d answered Ulysses, fiercely, \u201cyou are an insolent fellow\u2014so true is it that the gods do not grace\nall men alike in speech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence, but heaven has adorned\nthis with such a good conversation that he charms every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his\nhearers with him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, and wherever he goes he is looked up to. An-\nother may be as handsome as a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion. This is your case. No god\ncould make a finer looking fellow than you are, but you are a fool. Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceed-\ningly angry, and you are quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed, so long as I had youth\nand strength, I was among the first athletes of the age. Now, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I\nhave gone through much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite of all this I will\ncompete, for your taunts have stung me to the quick.\u201d\nSo he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc, larger, more massive and much heavier\nthan those used by the Phaeacians when disc-throwing among themselves. Then, swinging it back, he threw it from\nhis brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing\nof its flight as it sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been made yet. Minerva, in the\nform of a man, came and marked the place where it had fallen. \u201cA blind man, Sir,\u201d said she, \u201ccould easily tell your\nmark by groping for it\u2014it is so far ahead of any other. You may make your mind easy about this contest, for no\nPhaeacian can come near to such a throw as yours.\u201d\nUlysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on, so he began to speak more pleasantly.\n\u201cYoung men,\u201d said he, \u201ccome up to that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even heavier.\nIf anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I\ndo not care what it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but not with him because I am his guest, and one\ncannot compete with one\u2019s own personal friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a guest\nto challenge his host\u2019s family at any game, especially when he is in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from\nunder his own feet if he does; but I make no exception as regards any one else, for I want to have the matter out\nand know which is the best man. I am a good hand at every kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am\nan excellent archer. In battle I am always the first to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how many more\nare taking aim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man who could shoot better than I could when we\nAchaeans were before Troy and in practice. I far excel every one else in the whole world, of those who still eat bread\nupon the face of the earth, but I should not like to shoot against the mighty dead, such as Hercules, or Eurytus the\nCechalian-men who could shoot against the gods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by\n267 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nhis end, for Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer. I can throw a dart\nfarther than any one else can shoot an arrow. Running is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the\nPhaecians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am\nstill weak.\u201d\nThey all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, \u201cSir, we have had much pleasure in hearing all that\nyou have told us, from which I understand that you are willing to show your prowess, as having been displeased\nwith some insolent remarks that have been made to you by one of our athletes, and which could never have been\nuttered by any one who knows how to talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend my meaning, and will explain\nto any be one of your chief men who may be dining with yourself and your family when you get home, that we have\nan hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not particularly remarkable for our boxing, nor\nyet as wrestlers, but we are singularly fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of good dinners,\nmusic, and dancing; we also like frequent changes of linen, warm baths, and good beds, so now, please, some of you\nwho are the best dancers set about dancing, that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends how\nmuch we surpass all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, minstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre at my house,\nso run some one or other of you and fetch it for him.\u201d\nOn this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king\u2019s house, and the nine men who had been chosen\nas stewards stood forward. It was their business to manage everything connected with the sports, so they made the\nground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers. Presently the servant came back with Demodocus\u2019s lyre,\nand he took his place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in the town began to foot and trip it so\nnimbly that Ulysses was delighted with the merry twinkling of their feet.\nMeanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and how they first began their intrigue in\nthe house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus many presents, and defiled King Vulcan\u2019s marriage bed, so the sun, who\nsaw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he heard such dreadful news, so he went to\nhis smithy brooding mischief, got his great anvil into its place, and began to forge some chains which none could\neither unloose or break, so that they might stay there in that place. When he had finished his snare he went into\nhis bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like cobwebs; he also let many hang down from the\ngreat beam of the ceiling. Not even a god could see them, so fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had spread the\nchains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting out for the fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the\nworld was the one he was most fond of. But Mars kept no blind look out, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried\noff to his house, burning with love for Venus.\nNow Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was about sitting down when Mars came inside\nthe house, an said as he took her hand in his own, \u201cLet us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is not at home, but is gone\noff to Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is barbarous.\u201d\nShe was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest, whereon they were caught in the toils which\ncunning Vulcan had spread for them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too late that they\nwere in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for he had turned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the\nsun told him what was going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as\nhe shouted to all the gods.\n\u201cFather Jove,\u201d he cried, \u201cand all you other blessed gods who live for ever, come here and see the ridiculous and\ndisgraceful sight that I will show you. Jove\u2019s daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because I am lame. She is in\nlove with Mars, who is handsome and clean built, whereas I am a cripple\u2014but my parents are to blame for that, not\nI; they ought never to have begotten me. Come and see the pair together asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to\nlook at them. They are very fond of one another, but I do not think they will lie there longer than they can help, nor\ndo I think that they will sleep much; there, however, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave him\nfor his baggage of a daughter, who is fair but not honest.\u201d\nOn this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling Neptune came, and Mercury the bringer of\nluck, and King Apollo, but the goddesses stayed at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all good things\nstood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan\nhad been, whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:\n\u201cIll deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how limping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught\nMars who is the fleetest god in heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages.\u201d\nThus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, \u201cMessenger Mercury, giver of good things, you would\nnot care how strong the chains were, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?\u201d\n\u201cKing Apollo,\u201d answered Mercury, \u201cI only wish I might get the chance, though there were three times as many\nchains\u2014and you might look on, all of you, gods and goddesses, but would sleep with her if I could.\u201d\nThe immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune took it all seriously, and kept on implor-\ning Vulcan to set Mars free again. \u201cLet him go,\u201d he cried, \u201cand I will undertake, as you require, that he shall pay you\n268 The Odyssey\nall the damages that are held reasonable among the immortal gods.\u201d\n\u201cDo not,\u201d replied Vulcan, \u201cask me to do this; a bad man\u2019s bond is bad security; what remedy could I enforce\nagainst you if Mars should go away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?\u201d\n\u201cVulcan,\u201d said Neptune, \u201cif Mars goes away without paying his damages, I will pay you myself.\u201d So Vulcan an-\nswered, \u201cIn this case I cannot and must not refuse you.\u201d\nThereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were free they scampered off, Mars to Thra-\nce and laughter-loving Venus to Cyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with burnt offer-\nings. Here the Graces hathed her, and anointed her with oil of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and\nthey clothed her in raiment of the most enchanting beauty.\nThus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were charmed as they heard him.\nThen Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was no one to compete with them. So they\ntook a red ball which Polybus had made for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it up towards\nthe clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground and caught it with ease before it came down again. When\nthey had done throwing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance, and at the same time kept on throwing\nit backwards and forwards to one another, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great stamp-\ning with their feet. Then Ulysses said:\n\u201cKing Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the world, and indeed they have proved\nthemselves to be so. I was astonished as I saw them.\u201d\nThe king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaecians \u201cAldermen and town councillors, our guest\nseems to be a person of singular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably\nexpect. There are twelve chief men among you, and counting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a\nclean cloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in a lump down at once, so that when he gets his\nsupper he may do so with a light heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a present too, for\nhe has been rude.\u201d\nThus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and sent their servants to fetch the presents.\nThen Euryalus said, \u201cKing Alcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require. He shall have sword,\nwhich is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of silver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into\nwhich it fits. It will be worth a great deal to him.\u201d\nAs he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, \u201cGood luck to you, father stranger; if any-\nthing has been said amiss may the winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return, for I\nunderstand you have been long away from home, and have gone through much hardship.\u201d\nTo which Ulysses answered, \u201cGood luck to you too my friend, and may the gods grant you every happiness. I\nhope you will not miss the sword you have given me along with your apology.\u201d\nWith these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards sundown the presents began to make\ntheir appearance, as the servants of the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here his sons\nreceived them, and placed them under their mother\u2019s charge. Then Alcinous led the way to the house and bade his\nguests take their seats.\n\u201cWife,\u201d said he, turning to Queen Arete, \u201cGo, fetch the best chest we have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it.\nAlso, set a copper on the fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath; see also to the careful packing\nof the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing\nthat will follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet\u2014which is of exquisite workmanship\u2014that he may be\nreminded of me for the rest of his life whenever he makes a drink-offering to Jove, or to any of the gods.\u201d\nThen Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast as they could, whereon they set a tripod full\nof bath water on to a clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played\nabout the belly of the tripod. Meanwhile Arete brought a magnificent chest her own room, and inside it she packed\nall the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a\ngood shirt from Alcinous, and said to Ulysses:\n\u201cSee to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once, for fear any one should rob you by the way\nwhen you are asleep in your ship.\u201d\nWhen Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast with a bond that Circe had taught him. He\nhad done so before an upper servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was very glad of a warm\nbath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since he left the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained\nwith her had taken as good care of him as though he had been a god. When the servants had done washing and\nanointing him with oil, and had given him a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the guests who\nwere sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof if the cloister,\nand admired him as she saw him pass. \u201cFarewell stranger,\u201d said she, \u201cdo not forget me when you are safe at home\nagain, for it is to me first that you owe a ransom for having saved your life.\u201d\n269 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAnd Ulysses said, \u201cNausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove the mighty husband of Juno, grant that I\nmay reach my home; so shall I bless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved me.\u201d\nWhen he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was then served, and the wine was mixed\nfor drinking. A servant led in the favourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company, near one\nof the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might lean against it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork\nwith plenty of fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant, \u201cTake this piece of pork over to\nDemodocus and tell him to eat it; for all the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the less; bards are\nhonoured and respected throughout the world, for the muse teaches them their songs and loves them.\u201d\nThe servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, who took it and was very much pleased. They\nthen laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had to eat and drink,\nUlysses said to Demodocus, \u201cDemodocus, there is no one in the world whom I admire more than I do you. You\nmust have studied under the Muse, Jove\u2019s daughter, and under Apollo, so accurately do you sing the return of the\nAchaeans with all their sufferings and adventures. If you were not there yourself, you must have heard it all from\nsome one who was. Now, however, change your song and tell us of the wooden horse which Epeus made with the\nassistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got by stratagem into the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men\nwho afterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will tell all the world how magnificently heaven has\nendowed you.\u201d\nThe bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some of the Argives set fire to their tents and\nsailed away while others, hidden within the horse, were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan place of assembly. For\nthe Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round\nit, and were in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for breaking it up then and there; others would\nhave it dragged to the top of the rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice; while yet\nothers were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation for the gods. And this was how they settled it in the\nend, for the city was doomed when it took in that horse, within which were all the bravest of the Argives waiting\nto bring death and destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans issued from the horse,\nand sacked the town, breaking out from their ambuscade. He sang how they over ran the city hither and thither and\nravaged it, and how Ulysses went raging like Mars along with Menelaus to the house of Deiphobus. It was there that\nthe fight raged most furiously, nevertheless by Minerva\u2019s help he was victorious.\nAll this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his cheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a\nwoman weeps when she throws herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city and people,\nfighting bravely in defence of his home and children. She screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies\ngasping for breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the back and shoulders, and carry her\noff into slavery, to a life of labour and sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks\u2014even so piteously did Ulysses\nweep, but none of those present perceived his tears except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and could hear the\nsobs and sighs that he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:\n\u201cAldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease his song, for there are those present\nwho do not seem to like it. From the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to sing, our guest\nhas been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently in great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may\nall enjoy ourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should be, for all these festivities, with the\nescort and the presents that we are making with so much good will, are wholly in his honour, and any one with even\na moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own\nbrother.\n\u201cTherefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment nor reserve in the matter about which I shall\nask you; it will be more polite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your father and mother\nover yonder used to call you, and by which you were known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is\nno one, neither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any name whatever, for people\u2019s fathers and mothers give\nthem names as soon as they are born. Tell me also your country, nation, and city, that our ships may shape their\npurpose accordingly and take you there. For the Phaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as those of\nother nations have, but the ships themselves understand what it is that we are thinking about and want; they know\nall the cities and countries in the whole world, and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is covered with\nmist and cloud, so that there is no danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm. Still I do remember hearing my\nfather say that Neptune was angry with us for being too easy-going in the matter of giving people escorts. He said\nthat one of these days he should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from having escorted some one, and bury\nour city under a high mountain. This is what my used to say, but whether the god will carry out his threat or no is a\nmatter which he will decide for himself.\n\u201cAnd now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering, and in what countries have you travelled?\nTell us of the peoples themselves, and of their cities\u2014who were hostile, savage and uncivilized, and who, on the\n270 The Odyssey\nother hand, hospitable and humane. Tell us also why you are made unhappy on hearing about the return of the\nArgive Danaans from Troy. The gods arranged all this, and sent them their misfortunes in order that future gener-\nations might have something to sing about. Did you lose some brave kinsman of your wife\u2019s when you were before\nTroy? a son-in-law or father-in-law\u2014which are the nearest relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood? or\nwas it some brave and kindly-natured comrade\u2014for a good friend is as dear to a man as his own brother?\u201d\nBook IX\nAND ULYSSES answered, \u201cKing Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear a bard with such a divine voice as this man\nhas. There is nothing better or more delightful than when a whole people make merry together, with the guests\nsitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded with bread and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his\ncup for every man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however, since you are inclined to ask the\nstory of my sorrows, and rekindle my own sad memories in respect of them, I do not know how to begin, nor yet\nhow to continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me.\n\u201cFirstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it, and one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow,\nmay become my there guests though I live so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes, reknowned\namong mankind for all manner of subtlety, so that my fame ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a high\nmountain called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from it there is a group of islands very near to one an-\nother\u2014Dulichium, Same, and the wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon, all highest up in the sea\ntowards the sunset, while the others lie away from it towards dawn. It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men,\nand my eyes know none that they better love to look upon. The goddess Calypso kept me with her in her cave, and\nwanted me to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could neither of them persuade\nme, for there is nothing dearer to a man than his own country and his parents, and however splendid a home he\nmay have in a foreign country, if it be far from father or mother, he does not care about it. Now, however, I will tell\nyou of the many hazardous adventures which by Jove\u2019s will I met with on my return from Troy.\n\u201cWhen I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which is the city of the Cicons. There I sacked\nthe town and put the people to the sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we divided equitably\namongst us, so that none might have reason to complain. I then said that we had better make off at once, but my\nmen very foolishly would not obey me, so they stayed there drinking much wine and killing great numbers of sheep\nand oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the Cicons cried out for help to other Cicons who lived inland. These were\nmore in number, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of war, for they could fight, either from chari-\nots or on foot as the occasion served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as leaves and bloom in summer,\nand the hand of heaven was against us, so that we were hard pressed. They set the battle in array near the ships,\nand the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another. So long as the day waxed and it was still morning, we\nheld our own against them, though they were more in number than we; but as the sun went down, towards the time\nwhen men loose their oxen, the Cicons got the better of us, and we lost half a dozen men from every ship we had;\nso we got away with those that were left.\n\u201cThence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we had lost our\ncomrades, nor did we leave till we had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished by the hands\nof the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us till it blew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden\nin thick clouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before the gale, but the force of the\nwind tore our sails to tatters, so we took them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards the land.\nThere we lay two days and two nights suffering much alike from toil and distress of mind, but on the morning of\nthe third day we again raised our masts, set sail, and took our places, letting the wind and steersmen direct our ship.\nI should have got home at that time unharmed had not the North wind and the currents been against me as I was\ndoubling Cape Malea, and set me off my course hard by the island of Cythera.\n\u201cI was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the sea, but on the tenth day we reached the\nland of the Lotus-eater, who live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to take in fresh water,\nand our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of my\ncompany to see what manner of men the people of the place might be, and they had a third man under them. They\nstarted at once, and went about among the Lotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave them to eat of the lotus,\nwhich was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caring about home, and did not even want to go back and\nsay what had happened to them, but were for staying and munching lotus with the Lotus-eater without thinking\nfurther of their return; nevertheless, though they wept bitterly I forced them back to the ships and made them fast\nunder the benches. Then I told the rest to go on board at once, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and leave\noff wanting to get home, so they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars.\n\u201cWe sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the land of the lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now\n271 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthe Cyclopes neither plant nor plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley, and grapes as grow\nwild without any kind of tillage, and their wild grapes yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They\nhave no laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the tops of high mountains; each is lord and master\nin his family, and they take no account of their neighbours.\n\u201cNow off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not quite close to the land of the Cyclopes, but still\nnot far. It is overrun with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are never disturbed by foot of man; for\nsportsmen\u2014who as a rule will suffer so much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices\u2014do not go there,\nnor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a wilderness untilled and unsown from year to year, and has\nno living thing upon it but only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships, nor yet shipwrights who could make ships\nfor them; they cannot therefore go from city to city, or sail over the sea to one another\u2019s country as people who have\nships can do; if they had had these they would have colonized the island, for it is a very good one, and would yield\neverything in due season. There are meadows that in some places come right down to the sea shore, well watered\nand full of luscious grass; grapes would do there excellently; there is level land for ploughing, and it would always\nyield heavily at harvest time, for the soil is deep. There is a good harbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet an-\nchors, nor need a ship be moored, but all one has to do is to beach one\u2019s vessel and stay there till the wind becomes\nfair for putting out to sea again. At the head of the harbour there is a spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and\nthere are poplars growing all round it.\n\u201cHere we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must have brought us in, for there was nothing\nwhatever to be seen. A thick mist hung all round our ships; the moon was hidden behind a mass of clouds so that\nno one could have seen the island if he had looked for it, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close in\nshore before we found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we had beached the ships, we took down the\nsails, went ashore and camped upon the beach till daybreak.\n\u201cWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we admired the island and wandered all over it,\nwhile the nymphs Jove\u2019s daughters roused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On this we\nfetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and dividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the\ngoats. Heaven sent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got nine goats, while my own ship\nhad ten; thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill\u2014and we had plenty\nof wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full when we sacked the city of the Cicons, and this had not yet\nrun out. While we were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the Cyclopes, which was hard by, and\nsaw the smoke of their stubble fires. We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of their sheep\nand goats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped down upon the beach, and next morning I\ncalled a council.\n\u201c\u2019Stay here, my brave fellows,\u2019 said I, \u2018all the rest of you, while I go with my ship and exploit these people myself:\nI want to see if they are uncivilized savages, or a hospitable and humane race.\u2019\n\u201cI went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the hawsers; so they took their places and smote the\ngrey sea with their oars. When we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the face of a cliff near the sea, we saw\na great cave overhung with laurels. It was a station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there was a large\nyard, with a high wall round it made of stones built into the ground and of trees both pine and oak. This was the\nabode of a huge monster who was then away from home shepherding his flocks. He would have nothing to do with\nother people, but led the life of an outlaw. He was a horrid creature, not like a human being at all, but resembling\nrather some crag that stands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high mountain.\n\u201cI told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were, all but the twelve best among them, who\nwere to go along with myself. I also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by Maron, Apollo\nson of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo the patron god of Ismarus, and lived within the wooded precincts of the\ntemple. When we were sacking the city we respected him, and spared his life, as also his wife and child; so he made\nme some presents of great value\u2014seven talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars of sweet wine,\nunblended, and of the most exquisite flavour. Not a man nor maid in the house knew about it, but only himself, his\nwife, and one housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance\nfrom the mixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain from drinking. I filled a large skin with this\nwine, and took a wallet full of provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to deal with some\nsavage who would be of great strength, and would respect neither right nor law.\n\u201cWe soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went inside and took stock of all that we could\nsee. His cheese-racks were loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could hold. They\nwere kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets, then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very\nyoung ones all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all the vessels, bowls, and milk pails into which he\nmilked, were swimming with whey. When they saw all this, my men begged me to let them first steal some cheeses,\nand make off with them to the ship; they would then return, drive down the lambs and kids, put them on board and\n272 The Odyssey\nsail away with them. It would have been indeed better if we had done so but I would not listen to them, for I wanted\nto see the owner himself, in the hope that he might give me a present. When, however, we saw him my poor men\nfound him ill to deal with.\n\u201cWe lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others of them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops\nshould come in with his sheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood to light the fire\nfor his supper, and this he flung with such a noise on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far\nend of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside, as well as the she-goats that he was going to milk, leaving\nthe males, both rams and he-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone to the mouth of the cave\u2014so\nhuge that two and twenty strong four-wheeled waggons would not be enough to draw it from its place against the\ndoorway. When he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each of\nthem have her own young. He curdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the other half he poured\ninto bowls that he might drink it for his supper. When he had got through with all his work, he lit the fire, and then\ncaught sight of us, whereon he said:\n\u201c\u2019Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or do you sail the as rovers, with your hands\nagainst every man, and every man\u2019s hand against you?\u2019\n\u201cWe were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous form, but I managed to say, \u2018We are\nAchaeans on our way home from Troy, but by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been driven far out of\nour course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who has won infinite renown throughout the whole\nworld, by sacking so great a city and killing so many people. We therefore humbly pray you to show us some hospi-\ntality, and otherwise make us such presents as visitors may reasonably expect. May your excellency fear the wrath\nof heaven, for we are your suppliants, and Jove takes all respectable travellers under his protection, for he is the\navenger of all suppliants and foreigners in distress.\u2019\n\u201cTo this he gave me but a pitiless answer, \u2018Stranger,\u2019 said he, \u2018you are a fool, or else you know nothing of this\ncountry. Talk to me, indeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do not care about Jove or\nany of your blessed gods, for we are ever so much stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your com-\npanions out of any regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for doing so. And now tell me where you made your\nship fast when you came on shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off the land?\u2019\n\u201cHe said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caught in that way, so I answered with a lie; \u2018Neptune,\u2019\nsaid I, \u2018sent my ship on to the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We were driven on to them from\nthe open sea, but I and those who are with me escaped the jaws of death.\u2019\n\u201cThe cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a sudden clutch he gripped up two of my\nmen at once and dashed them down upon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed\nupon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore them limb from limb and supped upon\nthem. He gobbled them up like a lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without leaving anything\nuneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know\nwhat else to do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and had washed down his meal of human flesh\nwith a drink of neat milk, he stretched himself full length upon the ground among his sheep, and went to sleep. I\nwas at first inclined to seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into his vitals, but I reflected that if I did we should all\ncertainly be lost, for we should never be able to shift the stone which the monster had put in front of the door. So\nwe stayed sobbing and sighing where we were till morning came.\n\u201cWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, he again lit his fire, milked his goats and ewes,\nall quite rightly, and then let each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his work, he\nclutched up two more of my men, and began eating them for his morning\u2019s meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he\nrolled the stone away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back again\u2014as easily as though\nhe were merely clapping the lid on to a quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted, and cried \u2018Shoo,\nshoo,\u2019 after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain; so I was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and\ncovering myself with glory.\n\u201cIn the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows. The Cyclops had a great club which was lying\nnear one of the sheep pens; it was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it for a staff as soon as it\nshould be dry. It was so huge that we could only compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large\nburden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this club and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this\npiece to the men and told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded to do, and lastly I brought it to\na point myself, charring the end in the fire to make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was\nlying about all over the cave, and told the men to cast lots which of them should venture along with myself to lift it\nand bore it into the monster\u2019s eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom I should have chosen,\nand I myself made five. In the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, and drove his flocks into the cave\u2014\nthis time driving them all inside, and not leaving any in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have taken him, or\n273 Compact Anthology of World Literature\na god must have prompted him to do so. As soon as he had put the stone back to its place against the door, he sat\ndown, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and then let each have her own young one; when he had got\nthrough with all this work, he gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off them. So I went up to him\nwith an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands:\n\u201c\u2019Look here, Cyclops,\u2019 said I, you have been eating a great deal of man\u2019s flesh, so take this and drink some wine,\nthat you may see what kind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as a drink-offering, in the\nhope that you would take compassion upon me and further me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go on\nramping and raving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed yourself; how can you expect people to come see\nyou any more if you treat them in this way?\u2019\n\u201cHe then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the taste of the wine that he begged me for another\nbowl full. \u2018Be so kind,\u2019 he said, \u2018as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once. I want to make you a pres-\nent that you will be glad to have. We have wine even in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens\nthem, but this drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one.\u2019\n\u201cI then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him, and three times did he drain it without\nthought or heed; then, when I saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to him as plausibly as I could: \u2018Cyclops,\nyou ask my name and I will tell it you; give me, therefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is\nwhat my father and mother and my friends have always called me.\u2019\n\u201cBut the cruel wretch said, \u2018Then I will eat all Noman\u2019s comrades before Noman himself, and will keep Noman\nfor the last. This is the present that I will make him.\u2019\nAs he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground. His great neck hung heavily backwards\nand a deep sleep took hold upon him. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of human\nflesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk. Then I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to\nheat it, and encouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green though it was,\nwas about to blaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven had filled\ntheir hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam into the monster\u2019s eye, and bearing upon it with all\nmy weight I kept turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship\u2019s plank with an auger, which\ntwo men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot\nbeam into his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the steam from\nthe burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith\nplunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to temper it\u2014for it is this that gives strength to the iron\u2014and it makes\na great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops\u2019 eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells\nmade the cave ring again. We ran away in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye,\nand hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so to the other Cyclopes who lived on the\nbleak headlands near him; so they gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying, and\nasked what was the matter with him.\n\u201c\u2019What ails you, Polyphemus,\u2019 said they, \u2018that you make such a noise, breaking the stillness of the night, and\npreventing us from being able to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is trying to kill you\neither by fraud or by force?\n\u201cBut Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, \u2018Noman is killing me by fraud! Noman is killing me by\nforce!\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Then,\u2019 said they, \u2018if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when Jove makes people ill, there is no help for it,\nand you had better pray to your father Neptune.\u2019\n\u201cThen they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my clever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning\nand in an agony of pain, felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the door; then he sat in\nthe doorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might\nbe foolish enough to attempt this.\n\u201cAs for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own life and those of my companions; I\nschemed and schemed, as one who knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In the end\nI deemed that this plan would be the best. The male sheep were well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I\nbound them noiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on which the wicked monster used to sleep.\nThere was to be a man under the middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that there were\nthree sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than any of the others, so I caught hold of him by the\nback, esconced myself in the thick wool under his belly, and flung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a\nfirm hold on it all the time.\n\u201cThus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but when the child of morning, rosy-fingered\nDawn, appeared, the male sheep hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens waiting to be\nmilked, for their udders were full to bursting; but their master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as\n274 The Odyssey\nthey stood upright, without being sharp enough to find out that the men were underneath their bellies. As the ram\nwas going out, last of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self; Polyphemus laid hold of it and\nsaid:\n\u201c\u2019My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this morning? You are not wont to let the\newes go before you, but lead the mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are the first to\ncome home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are\nsorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid crew have got him down in his drink and blinded him? But I will\nhave his life yet. If you could understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash\nhis brains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I should thus have some satisfaction for the harm a this\nno-good Noman has done me.\u2019\n\u201cAs spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way out from the cave and yards, I first got from\nunder the ram\u2019s belly, and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by constantly heading\nthem in the right direction we managed to drive them down to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of\nus who had escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed. However, I made signs to them by\nnodding and frowning that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all the sheep on board at once and\nput out to sea; so they went aboard, took their places, and smote the grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got\nas far out as my voice would reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops.\n\u201c\u2019Cyclops,\u2019 said I, \u2018you should have taken better measure of your man before eating up his comrades in your\ncave. You wretch, eat up your visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin would find you out,\nand now Jove and the other gods have punished you.\u2019\n\u201cHe got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from off a high mountain, and flung it just\nin front of my ship so that it was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell into\nit, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore. But I\nsnatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my men by nodding my head, that they must row for\ntheir lives, whereon they laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were before, I was for jeering at\nthe Cyclops again, but the men begged and prayed of me to hold my tongue.\n\u201c\u2019Do not,\u2019 they exclaimed, \u2018be mad enough to provoke this savage creature further; he has thrown one rock at\nus already which drove us back again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death of us; if he had then\nheard any further sound of voices he would have pounded our heads and our ship\u2019s timbers into a jelly with the\nrugged rocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.\u2019\n\u201cBut I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage, \u2018Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was\nthat put your eye out and spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of Laertes, who lives in\nIthaca.\u2019\n\u201cOn this he groaned, and cried out, \u2018Alas, alas, then the old prophecy about me is coming true. There was a\nprophet here, at one time, a man both brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, who was an excellent\nseer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he grew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some\nday, and said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been all along expecting some one of imposing\npresence and superhuman strength, whereas he turns out to be a little insignificant weakling, who has managed\nto blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come here, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents to\nshow my hospitality, and urge Neptune to help you forward on your journey\u2014for Neptune and I are father and son.\nHe, if he so will, shall heal me, which no one else neither god nor man can do.\u2019\n\u201cThen I said, \u2018I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and sending you down to the house of Hades, as I\nam that it will take more than Neptune to cure that eye of yours.\u2019\n\u201cOn this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed, saying, \u2018Hear me, great Neptune; if I am\nindeed your own true-begotten son, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must get back to his\nfriends at last, let him do so late and in sore plight after losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man\u2019s\nship and find trouble in his house.\u2019]\n\u201cThus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up a rock much larger than the first, swung\nit aloft and hurled it with prodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a little of hitting the end of\nthe rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on our way\ntowards the shore of the island.\n\u201cWhen at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our ships, we found our comrades lamenting us,\nand anxiously awaiting our return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the sea shore; we also\nlanded the Cyclops\u2019 sheep, and divided them equitably amongst us so that none might have reason to complain.\nAs for the ram, my companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share; so I sacrificed it on the sea shore,\nand burned its thigh bones to Jove, who is the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only thought how he\nmight destroy my ships and my comrades.\n275 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u201cThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and drink, but when\nthe sun went down and it came on dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered\nDawn, appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they took their places and smote the grey\nsea with their oars; so we sailed on with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we had lost\nour comrades.\nBook X\nTHENCE we went on to the Aeoli island where lives Aeolus son of Hippotas, dear to the immortal gods. It is an\nisland that floats (as it were) upon the sea, iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now, Aeolus has six daughters and\nsix lusty sons, so he made the sons marry the daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother, feasting\nand enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long the atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour\nof roasting meats till it groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well-made bedsteads, each with\nhis own wife between the blankets. These were the people among whom we had now come.\n\u201cAeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the time about Troy, the Argive fleet, and\nthe return of the Achaeans. I told him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must go, and asked\nhim to further me on my way, he made no sort of difficulty, but set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed\nme a prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut up in the hide as in a sack\u2014for Jove had\nmade him captain over the winds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to his own pleasure. He put\nthe sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind could\nblow from any quarter. The West wind which was fair for us did he alone let blow as it chose; but it all came to\nnothing, for we were lost through our own folly.\n\u201cNine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native land showed on the horizon. We got so\nclose in that we could see the stubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell into a light sleep, for I had never\nlet the rudder out of my own hands, that we might get home the faster. On this the men fell to talking among them-\nselves, and said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack that Aeolus had given me. \u2018Bless my heart,\u2019 would\none turn to his neighbour, saying, \u2018how this man gets honoured and makes friends to whatever city or country he\nmay go. See what fine prizes he is taking home from Troy, while we, who have travelled just as far as he has, come\nback with hands as empty as we set out with\u2014and now Aeolus has given him ever so much more. Quick\u2014let us see\nwhat it all is, and how much gold and silver there is in the sack he gave him.\u2019\n\u201cThus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack, whereupon the wind flew howling forth\nand raised a storm that carried us weeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke, and knew not\nwhether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make the best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay\ndown in the ship, while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our fleet back to the Aeolian island.\n\u201cWhen we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined hard by the ships. Immediately after dinner I\ntook a herald and one of my men and went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him feasting with his wife\nand family; so we sat down as suppliants on the threshold. They were astounded when they saw us and said, \u2018Ulyss-\nes, what brings you here? What god has been ill-treating you? We took great pains to further you on your way home\nto Ithaca, or wherever it was that you wanted to go to.\u2019\n\u201cThus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, \u2018My men have undone me; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined\nme. My friends, mend me this mischief, for you can if you will.\u2019\n\u201cI spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their father answered, \u2018Vilest of mankind, get you\ngone at once out of the island; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for you come here as one ab-\nhorred of heaven. \u201cAnd with these words he sent me sorrowing from his door.\n\u201cThence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and fruitless rowing, for there was no longer\nany wind to help them. Six days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached the rocky stronghold\nof Lamus\u2014Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians, where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to\nbe milked] salutes him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last answers the salute. In that country a man\nwho could do without sleep might earn double wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a shepherd, for\nthey work much the same by night as they do by day.\n\u201cWhen we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep cliffs, with a narrow entrance between two\nheadlands. My captains took all their ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for there was never so\nmuch as a breath of wind inside, but it was always dead calm. I kept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock\nat the very end of the point; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoitre, but could see no sign neither of man nor\ncattle, only some smoke rising from the ground. So I sent two of my company with an attendant to find out what\nsort of people the inhabitants were.\n\u201cThe men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the people draw their firewood from the\n276 The Odyssey\nmountains into the town, till presently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water, and who was\ndaughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going to the fountain Artacia from which the people bring\nin their water, and when my men had come close up to her, they asked her who the king of that country might be,\nand over what kind of people he ruled; so she directed them to her father\u2019s house, but when they got there they\nfound his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain, and they were horrified at the sight of her.\n\u201cShe at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly, and forthwith he set about killing my\nmen. He snatched up one of them, and began to make his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other two ran\nback to the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates raised a hue and cry after them, and thousands of sturdy\nLaestrygonians sprang up from every quarter\u2014ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at us from the cliffs as though\nthey had been mere stones, and I heard the horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and the\ndeath cries of my men, as the Laestrygonians speared them like fishes and took them home to eat them. While they\nwere thus killing my men within the harbour I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and told my men to\nrow with alf their might if they too would not fare like the rest; so they laid out for their lives, and we were thankful\nenough when we got into open water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us. As for the others there was not one\nof them left.\n\u201cThence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we had lost our comrades, and came to the\nAeaean island, where Circe lives a great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician Aeetes\u2014for they\nare both children of the sun by Perse, who is daughter to Oceanus. We brought our ship into a safe harbour without\na word, for some god guided us thither, and having landed we there for two days and two nights, worn out in body\nand mind. When the morning of the third day came I took my spear and my sword, and went away from the ship\nto reconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human handiwork, or hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the\ntop of a high look-out I espied the smoke of Circe\u2019s house rising upwards amid a dense forest of trees, and when I\nsaw this I doubted whether, having seen the smoke, I would not go on at once and find out more, but in the end I\ndeemed it best to go back to the ship, give the men their dinners, and send some of them instead of going myself.\n\u201cWhen I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my solitude, and sent a fine antlered stag\nright into the middle of my path. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the river, for the heat of\nthe sun drove him, and as he passed I struck him in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went clean\nthrough him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my\nspear from the wound, and laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them into a fathom or\nso of good stout rope, with which I bound the four feet of the noble creature together; having so done I hung him\nround my neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for the stag was much too big for me to be able\nto carry him on my shoulder, steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down in front of the ship, I called the\nmen and spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them. \u2018Look here my friends,\u2019 said I, \u2018we are not going to die so\nmuch before our time after all, and at any rate we will not starve so long as we have got something to eat and drink\non board.\u2019 On this they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag, for he was indeed a splen-\ndid fellow. Then, when they had feasted their eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands and began to cook\nhim for dinner.\n\u201cThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed there eating and drinking our fill, but\nwhen the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning, fingered\nDawn, appeared, I called a council and said, \u2018My friends, we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me. We\nhave no idea where the sun either sets or rises, so that we do not even know East from West. I see no way out of it;\nnevertheless, we must try and find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as high as I could this morning,\nand saw the sea reaching all round it to the horizon; it lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out\nof a thick forest of trees.\u2019\n\u201cTheir hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they had been treated by the Laestrygonian\nAntiphates, and by the savage ogre Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing to be got\nby crying, so I divided them into two companies and set a captain over each; I gave one company to Eurylochus,\nwhile I took command of the other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot fell upon Eurylochus; so he set\nout with his twenty-two men, and they wept, as also did we who were left behind.\n\u201cWhen they reached Circe\u2019s house they found it built of cut stones, on a site that could be seen from far, in the\nmiddle of the forest. There were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it\u2014poor bewitched creatures\nwhom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged into subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged\ntheir great tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against them. As hounds crowd round their\nmaster when they see him coming from dinner\u2014for they know he will bring them something\u2014even so did these\nwolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men, but the men were terribly frightened at seeing such\nstrange creatures. Presently they reached the gates of the goddess\u2019s house, and as they stood there they could hear\nCirce within, singing most beautifully as she worked at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such daz-\n277 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nzling colours as no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued and trusted more than any other\nof my men, said, \u2018There is some one inside working at a loom and singing most beautifully; the whole place re-\nsounds with it, let us call her and see whether she is woman or goddess.\u2019\n\u201cThey called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them enter. They, thinking no evil, fol-\nlowed her, all except Eurylochus, who suspected mischief and stayed outside. When she had got them into her\nhouse, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian but\nshe drugged it with wicked poisons to make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she turned them\ninto pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in her pigsties. They were like pigs-head, hair, and all, and they\ngrunted just as pigs do; but their senses were the same as before, and they remembered everything.\n\u201cThus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some acorns and beech masts such as pigs eat,\nbut Eurylochus hurried back to tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with dismay that\nthough he tried to speak he could find no words to do so; his eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh,\ntill at last we forced his story out of him, and he told us what had happened to the others.\n\u201c\u2019We went,\u2019 said he, as you told us, through the forest, and in the middle of it there was a fine house built with\ncut stones in a place that could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she was a goddess, working at\nher loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to her and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened\nthe door, and invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief so they followed her into the house, but I stayed\nwhere I was, for I thought there might be some treachery. From that moment I saw them no more, for not one of\nthem ever came out, though I sat a long time watching for them.\u2019\n\u201cThen I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also took my bow, and told Eurylochus to\ncome back with me and show me the way. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously, saying,\n\u2018Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let me stay here, for I know you will not bring one of them back with you,\nnor even return alive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any rate with the few that are left us, for we\nmay still save our lives.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Stay where you are, then, \u2018answered I, \u2018eating and drinking at the ship, but I must go, for I am most urgently\nbound to do so.\u2019\n\u201cWith this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through the charmed grove, and was near the great\nhouse of the enchantress Circe, I met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the hey-day of\nhis youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his face. He came up to me and took my hand within his\nown, saying, \u2018My poor unhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top, alone and without knowing\nthe way? Your men are shut up in Circe\u2019s pigsties, like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not fancy that\nyou can set them free? I can tell you that you will never get back and will have to stay there with the rest of them.\nBut never mind, I will protect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which is one of great virtue, and\nkeep it about you when you go to Circe\u2019s house, it will be a talisman to you against every kind of mischief.\n\u201c\u2019And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try to practise upon you. She will mix a mess\nfor you to drink, and she will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to charm you, for the\nvirtue of the herb that I shall give you will prevent her spells from working. I will tell you all about it. When Circe\nstrikes you with her wand, draw your sword and spring upon her as though you were goings to kill her. She will\nthen be frightened and will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must not point blank refuse her, for you\nwant her to set your companions free, and to take good care also of yourself, but you make her swear solemnly by\nall the blessed that she will plot no further mischief against you, or else when she has got you naked she will unman\nyou and make you fit for nothing.\u2019\n\u201cAs he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground an showed me what it was like. The root was black, while the\nflower was as white as milk; the gods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods can do whatever\nthey like.\n\u201cThen Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island; but I fared onward to the house\nof Circe, and my heart was clouded with care as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stood there and called\nthe goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came down, opened the door, and asked me to come in; so I followed\nher\u2014much troubled in my mind. She set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver, there was a footstool\nalso under my feet, and she mixed a mess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it, for she meant me\nmischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk it without its charming me, she struck she, struck me with her\nwand. \u2018There now,\u2019 she cried, \u2018be off to the pigsty, and make your lair with the rest of them.\u2019\n\u201cBut I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her, whereon she fell with a loud scream,\nclasped my knees, and spoke piteously, saying, \u2018Who and whence are you? from what place and people have you\ncome? How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you? Never yet was any man able to stand so much\nas a taste of the herb I gave you; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other than the bold hero Ulysses,\nwho Mercury always said would come here some day with his ship while on his way home form Troy; so be it then;\n278 The Odyssey\nsheathe your sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends and learn to trust each other.\u2019\n\u201cAnd I answered, \u2018Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with you when you have just been turning all my\nmen into pigs? And now that you have got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me to go to bed\nwith you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. I shall certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless\nyou will first take your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.\u2019\n\u201cSo she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had completed her oath then I went to bed with her.\n\u201cMeanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about their work. They are the children of the\ngroves and fountains, and of the holy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread a fair purple cloth over\na seat, and laid a carpet underneath it. Another brought tables of silver up to the seats, and set them with baskets\nof gold. A third mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put golden cups upon the tables, while the\nfourth she brought in water and set it to boil in a large cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted. When the\nwater in the cauldron was boiling, she poured cold into it till it was just as I liked it, and then she set me in a bath\nand began washing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders, to take the tire and stiffness out of my\nlimbs. As soon as she had done washing me and anointing me with oil, she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt\nand led me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under my feet. A maid servant\nthen brought me water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash my hands, and\nshe drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant brought me bread and offered me many things of what there was\nin the house, and then Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without heeding what was before me, still moody\nand suspicious.\n\u201cWhen Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief, she came to me and said, \u2018Ulysses, why do\nyou sit like that as though you were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and drink? Is it that\nyou are still suspicious? You ought not to be, for I have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.\u2019\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can think of either eating or drinking in your house\nuntil you have set his friends free and let him see them. If you want me to eat and drink, you must free my men and\nbring them to me that I may see them with my own eyes.\u2019\n\u201cWhen I had said this she went straight through the court with her wand in her hand and opened the pigsty\ndoors. My men came out like so many prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about among them and\nanointed each with a second drug, whereon the bristles that the bad drug had given them fell off, and they became\nmen again, younger than they were before, and much taller and better looking. They knew me at once, seized me\neach of them by the hand, and wept for joy till the whole house was filled with the sound of their hullabalooing, and\nCirce herself was so sorry for them that she came up to me and said, \u2018Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, go back at once\nto the sea where you have left your ship, and first draw it on to the land. Then, hide all your ship\u2019s gear and property\nin some cave, and come back here with your men.\u2019\n\u201cI agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found the men at the ship weeping and wailing most\npiteously. When they saw me the silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break out and gambol\nround their mothers, when they see them coming home to be milked after they have been feeding all day, and the\nhomestead resounds with their lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as though they had got back to their own\nrugged Ithaca, where they had been born and bred. \u2018Sir,\u2019 said the affectionate creatures, \u2018we are as glad to see you\nback as though we had got safe home to Ithaca; but tell us all about the fate of our comrades.\u2019\n\u201cI spoke comfortingly to them and said, \u2018We must draw our ship on to the land, and hide the ship\u2019s gear with\nall our property in some cave; then come with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe\u2019s house, where you will find\nyour comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great abundance.\u2019\n\u201cOn this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus tried to hold them back and said, \u2018Alas,\npoor wretches that we are, what will become of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of Circe, who will\nturn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to keep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops\ntreated us when our comrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them. It was all through his sheer folly that\nthose men lost their lives.\u2019\n\u201cWhen I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and\ncut his head off in spite of his being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him and said, \u2018Sir, if it\nmay so be, let this fellow stay here and mind the ship, but take the rest of us with you to Circe\u2019s house.\u2019\n\u201cOn this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind after all, but came on too, for he was frightened\nby the severe reprimand that I had given him.\n\u201cMeanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left behind were washed and anointed with\nolive oil; she had also given them woollen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all comfortably at\ndinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other face to face and knew one another, they wept for joy and\ncried aloud till the whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me and said, \u2018Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,\ntell your men to leave off crying; I know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you have fared\n279 Compact Anthology of World Literature\namong cruel savages on the mainland, but that is over now, so stay here, and eat and drink till you are once more\nas strong and hearty as you were when you left Ithaca; for at present you are weakened both in body and mind; you\nkeep all the time thinking of the hardships\u2014you have suffered during your travels, so that you have no more cheer-\nfulness left in you.\u2019\n\u201cThus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole twelvemonth feasting upon an untold\nquantity both of meat and wine. But when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days had come\nround, my men called me apart and said, \u2018Sir, it is time you began to think about going home, if so be you are to be\nspared to see your house and native country at all.\u2019\n\u201cThus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted\nour fill on meat and wine, but when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down to sleep\nin the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got into bed with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess\nlistened to what I had got to say. \u2018Circe,\u2019 said I, \u2018please to keep the promise you made me about furthering me on\nmy homeward voyage. I want to get back and so do my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints as\nsoon as ever your back is turned.\u2019\n\u201cAnd the goddess answered, \u2018Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall none of you stay here any longer if you do\nnot want to, but there is another journey which you have got to take before you can sail homewards. You must go\nto the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine to consult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias whose\nreason is still unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine left his understanding even in death, but the other ghosts flit\nabout aimlessly.\u2019\n\u201cI was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would gladly have lived no longer to see the\nlight of the sun, but presently when I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, \u2018And who shall guide me\nupon this voyage\u2014for the house of Hades is a port that no ship can reach.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019You will want no guide,\u2019 she answered; \u2018raise you mast, set your white sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind\nwill blow you there of itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will reach the fertile shore of\nProserpine\u2019s country with its groves of tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your ship\nupon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark abode of Hades. You will find it near the place where the\nrivers Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron, and you will see a rock\nnear it, just where the two roaring rivers run into one another.\n\u201c\u2019When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth,\nand pour into it as a drink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then wine, and in the third place\nwater-sprinkling white barley meal over the whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble\nghosts, and promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you\nhave, and will load the pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that Teiresias shall have a black\nsheep all to himself, the finest in all your flocks.\n\u201c\u2019When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer them a ram and a black ewe, bending\ntheir heads towards Erebus; but yourself turn away from them as though you would make towards the river. On\nthis, many dead men\u2019s ghosts will come to you, and you must tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have just\nkilled, and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades and to Proserpine. Then draw your sword and sit\nthere, so as to prevent any other poor ghost from coming near the split blood before Teiresias shall have answered\nyour questions. The seer will presently come to you, and will tell you about your voyage\u2014what stages you are to\nmake, and how you are to sail the see so as to reach your home.\u2019\n\u201cIt was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed me in my shirt and cloak. As for herself\nshe threw a beautiful light gossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle round her waist, and\nshe covered her head with a mantle. Then I went about among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke\nkindly to each of them man by man: \u2018You must not lie sleeping here any longer,\u2019 said I to them, \u2018we must be going,\nfor Circe has told me all about it.\u2019 And this they did as I bade them.\n\u201cEven so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We had with us a certain youth named El-\npenor, not very remarkable for sense or courage, who had got drunk and was lying on the house-top away from the\nrest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the noise of the men bustling about, he jumped\nup on a sudden and forgot all about coming down by the main staircase, so he tumbled right off the roof and broke\nhis neck, and his soul went down to the house of Hades.\n\u201cWhen I had got the men together I said to them, \u2018You think you are about to start home again, but Circe has\nexplained to me that instead of this, we have got to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to consult the ghost of\nthe Theban prophet Teiresias.\u2019\n\u201cThe men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves on the ground groaning and tearing\ntheir hair, but they did not mend matters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting our\nfate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard by the ship. She passed through the midst of\n280 The Odyssey\nus without our knowing it, for who can see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does not wish to be seen?\nBook XI\nTHEN, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into the water and got her mast and sails into\nher; we also put the sheep on board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind. Circe, that great\nand cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft and stayed steadily with us keeping our sails all the time\nwell filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship\u2019s gear and let her go as the wind and helmsman headed her.\nAll day long her sails were full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun went down and darkness was\nover all the earth, we got into the deep waters of the river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians\nwho live enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce neither at his rising nor as he goes\ndown again out of the heavens, but the poor wretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there we\nbeached the ship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the waters of Oceanus till we came to the place of\nwhich Circe had told us.\n\u201cHere Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword and dug the trench a cubit each\nway. I made a drink-offering to all the dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with water, and\nI sprinkled white barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to the poor feckless ghosts, and promising them\nthat when I got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best I had, and would load the pyre\nwith good things. I also particularly promised that Teiresias should have a black sheep to himself, the best in all my\nflocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats of the two sheep and let the blood run into the\ntrench, whereon the ghosts came trooping up from Erebus\u2014brides, young bachelors, old men worn out with toil,\nmaids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had been killed in battle, with their armour still smirched\nwith blood; they came from every quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange kind of screaming sound that\nmade me turn pale with fear. When I saw them coming I told the men to be quick and flay the carcasses of the two\ndead sheep and make burnt offerings of them, and at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to Proserpine;\nbut I sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless ghosts come near the blood till\nTeiresias should have answered my questions.\n\u201cThe first ghost \u2018that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he had not yet been laid beneath the earth. We\nhad left his body unwaked and unburied in Circe\u2019s house, for we had had too much else to do. I was very sorry for\nhim, and cried when I saw him: \u2018Elpenor,\u2019 said I, \u2018how did you come down here into this gloom and darkness? You\nhave here on foot quicker than I have with my ship.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Sir,\u2019 he answered with a groan, \u2018it was all bad luck, and my own unspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep\non the top of Circe\u2019s house, and never thought of coming down again by the great staircase but fell right off the roof\nand broke my neck, so my soul down to the house of Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you have\nleft behind you, though they are not here, by your wife, by the father who brought you up when you were a child,\nand by Telemachus who is the one hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I know that when you leave\nthis limbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean island. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied\nbehind you, or I may bring heaven\u2019s anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armour I have, build a barrow for\nme on the sea shore, that may tell people in days to come what a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant over my grave\nthe oar I used to row with when I was yet alive and with my messmates.\u2019 And I said, \u2018My poor fellow, I will do all\nthat you have asked of me.\u2019\n\u201cThus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the one side of the trench with my sword held\nover the blood, and the ghost of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. Then came the ghost of my\ndead mother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. I had left her alive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears\nwhen I saw her, but even so, for all my sorrow I would not let her come near the blood till I had asked my questions\nof Teiresias.\n\u201cThen came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden sceptre in his hand. He knew me and said,\n\u2018Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why, poor man, have you left the light of day and come down to visit the dead in this\nsad place? Stand back from the trench and withdraw your sword that I may drink of the blood and answer your\nquestions truly.\u2019\n\u201cSo I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of the blood he began with his prophecy.\n\u201cYou want to know,\u2019 said he, \u2018about your return home, but heaven will make this hard for you. I do not think\nthat you will escape the eye of Neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having blinded his son.\nStill, after much suffering you may get home if you can restrain yourself and your companions when your ship\nreaches the Thrinacian island, where you will find the sheep and cattle belonging to the sun, who sees and gives\near to everything. If you leave these flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of getting home, you may yet after\n281 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nmuch hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and of\nyour men. Even though you may yourself escape, you will return in bad plight after losing all your men, [in another\nman\u2019s ship, and you will find trouble in your house, which will be overrun by high-handed people, who are devour-\ning your substance under the pretext of paying court and making presents to your wife.\n\u201c\u2019When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and after you have killed them by force or\nfraud in your own house, you must take a well-made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to a country where\nthe people have never heard of the sea and do not even mix salt with their food, nor do they know anything about\nships, and oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain token which cannot escape your notice.\nA wayfarer will meet you and will say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your shoulder; on\nthis you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune. Then go home and offer\nhecatombs to an the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself, death shall come to you from the sea, and\nyour life shall ebb away very gently when you are full of years and peace of mind, and your people shall bless you.\nAll that I have said will come true].\u2019\n\u201c\u2019This,\u2019 I answered, \u2018must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and tell me and tell me true, I see my poor\nmother\u2019s ghost close by us; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am her own son she does\nnot remember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how I can make her know me.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019That,\u2019 said he, \u2018I can soon do Any ghost that you let taste of the blood will talk with you like a reasonable be-\ning, but if you do not let them have any blood they will go away again.\u2019\n\u201cOn this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for his prophecyings had now been spoken, but\nI sat still where I was until my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and spoke fondly\nto me, saying, \u2018My son, how did you come down to this abode of darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard thing\nfor the living to see these places, for between us and them there are great and terrible waters, and there is Oceanus,\nwhich no man can cross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him. Are you all this time trying to find your\nway home from Troy, and have you never yet got back to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Mother,\u2019 said I, \u2018I was forced to come here to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never\nyet been near the Achaean land nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one long series of\nmisfortunes from the very first day that I set out with Agamemnon for Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the\nTrojans. But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die? Did you have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe\nyou a gentle easy passage to eternity? Tell me also about my father, and the son whom I left behind me; is my prop-\nerty still in their hands, or has some one else got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim it? Tell me\nagain what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is; does she live with my son and guard my estate securely,\nor has she made the best match she could and married again?\u2019\n\u201cMy mother answered, \u2018Your wife still remains in your house, but she is in great distress of mind and spends her\nwhole time in tears both night and day. No one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and Telemachus still\nholds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain largely, as of course he must, considering his position as a mag-\nistrate, and how every one invites him; your father remains at his old place in the country and never goes near the\ntown. He has no comfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in front of the fire with the men\nand goes about all in rags, but in summer, when the warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the vineyard on a\nbed of vine leaves thrown anyhow upon the ground. He grieves continually about your never having come home,\nand suffers more and more as he grows older. As for my own end it was in this wise: heaven did not take me swiftly\nand painlessly in my own house, nor was I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear people out and\nkill them, but my longing to know what you were doing and the force of my affection for you\u2014this it was that was\nthe death of me.\u2019\n\u201cThen I tried to find some way of embracing my mother\u2019s ghost. Thrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp\nher in my arms, but each time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and being touched to\nthe quick I said to her, \u2018Mother, why do you not stay still when I would embrace you? If we could throw our arms\naround one another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in the house of Hades; does Pros-\nerpine want to lay a still further load of grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?\u2019\n\u201c\u2019My son,\u2019 she answered, \u2018most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not Proserpine that is beguiling you, but all peo-\nple are like this when they are dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together; these perish in the\nfierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has left the body, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. Now,\nhowever, go back to the light of day as soon as you can, and note all these things that you may tell them to your wife\nhereafter.\u2019\n\u201cThus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the wives and daughters of all the most\nfamous men. They gathered in crowds about the blood, and I considered how I might question them severally. In\nthe end I deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all\ndrinking the blood at once. So they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned her told me her race\n282 The Odyssey\nand lineage.\n\u201cThe first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of Cretheus the son of Aeolus. She fell in\nlove with the river Enipeus who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she was taking\na walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her lover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue\nwave arched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god, whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and\nlaid her in a deep slumber. When the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in his own and said,\n\u2018Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the gods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this time\ntwelve months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, so now go home, but hold your tongue and do not tell any\none.\u2019\n\u201cThen he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and Neleus, who both of them served Jove with\nall their might. Pelias was a great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in Pylos. The rest of her\nchildren were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.\n\u201cNext to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of having slept in the arms of even Jove him-\nself, and who bore him two sons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates, and built a wall\nall round it; for strong though they were they could not hold Thebes till they had walled it.\n\u201cThen I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove indomitable Hercules; and Megara who\nwas daughter to great King Creon, and married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.\n\u201cI also saw fair Epicaste mother of king OEdipodes whose awful lot it was to marry her own son without\nsuspecting it. He married her after having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to the world;\nwhereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief for the spite the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went to the\nhouse of the mighty jailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the avenging spirits haunted him as for an\noutraged mother\u2014to his ruing bitterly thereafter.\n\u201cThen I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given priceless presents for her. She was\nyoungest daughter to Amphion son of Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She bore\nNestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she also bore that marvellously lovely woman Pero, who was wooed by\nall the country round; but Neleus would only give her to him who should raid the cattle of Iphicles from the graz-\ning grounds of Phylace, and this was a hard task. The only man who would undertake to raid them was a certain\nexcellent seer, but the will of heaven was against him, for the rangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison;\nnevertheless when a full year had passed and the same season came round again, Iphicles set him at liberty, after he\nhad expounded all the oracles of heaven. Thus, then, was the will of Jove accomplished.\n\u201cAnd I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons, Castor breaker of horses, and Pollux the\nmighty boxer. Both these heroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive, for by a special dispensation of\nJove, they die and come to life again, each one of them every other day throughout all time, and they have the rank\nof gods.\n\u201cAfter her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace of Neptune. She bore two sons Otus and\nEphialtes, but both were short lived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this world, and the best\nlooking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they were nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round\nthe chest. They threatened to make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried to set Mount Ossa on the top of Mount\nOlympus, and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they would have done it too\nif they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of them, before they had got so much as a sign of\nhair upon their cheeks or chin.\n\u201cThen I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the magician Minos, whom Theseus was carry-\ning off from Crete to Athens, but he did not enjoy her, for before he could do so Diana killed her in the island of Dia\non account of what Bacchus had said against her.\n\u201cI also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own husband for gold. But it would take me\nall night if I were to name every single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and it is time for me to\ngo to bed, either on board ship with my crew, or here. As for my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to it.\u201d\nHere he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless throughout the covered cloister. Then\nArete said to them:\n\u201cWhat do you think of this man, O Phaecians? Is he not tall and good looking, and is he not Clever? True, he\nis my own guest, but all of you share in the distinction. Do not he a hurry to send him away, nor niggardly in the\npresents you make to one who is in such great need, for heaven has blessed all of you with great abundance.\u201d\nThen spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men among them, \u201cMy friends,\u201d said he, \u201cwhat\nour august queen has just said to us is both reasonable and to the purpose, therefore be persuaded by it; but the\ndecision whether in word or deed rests ultimately with King Alcinous.\u201d\n\u201cThe thing shall be done,\u201d exclaimed Alcinous, \u201cas surely as I still live and reign over the Phaeacians. Our guest\nis indeed very anxious to get home, still we must persuade him to remain with us until to-morrow, by which time\n283 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nI shall be able to get together the whole sum that I mean to give him. As regards\u2014his escort it will be a matter for\nyou all, and mine above all others as the chief person among you.\u201d\nAnd Ulysses answered, \u201cKing Alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay here for a whole twelve months, and then\nspeed me on my way, loaded with your noble gifts, I should obey you gladly and it would redound greatly to my\nadvantage, for I should return fuller-handed to my own people, and should thus be more respected and beloved by\nall who see me when I get back to Ithaca.\u201d\n\u201cUlysses,\u201d replied Alcinous, \u201cnot one of us who sees you has any idea that you are a charlatan or a swindler. I\nknow there are many people going about who tell such plausible stories that it is very hard to see through them, but\nthere is a style about your language which assures me of your good disposition. Moreover you have told the story of\nyour own misfortunes, and those of the Argives, as though you were a practised bard; but tell me, and tell me true,\nwhether you saw any of the mighty heroes who went to Troy at the same time with yourself, and perished there. The\nevenings are still at their longest, and it is not yet bed time\u2014go on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay\nhere listening till to-morrow morning, so long as you will continue to tell us of your adventures.\u201d\n\u201cAlcinous,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201cthere is a time for making speeches, and a time for going to bed; nevertheless,\nsince you so desire, I will not refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades who did not fall\nfighting with the Trojans, but perished on their return, through the treachery of a wicked woman.\n\u201cWhen Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions, the ghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus\ncame sadly up tome, surrounded by those who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon as he had\ntasted the blood he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out his arms towards me to embrace me; but he had no\nstrength nor substance any more, and I too wept and pitied him as I beheld him. \u2018How did you come by your death,\u2019\nsaid I, \u2018King Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your\nenemies make an end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while they were\nfighting in defence of their wives and city?\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Ulysses,\u2019 he answered, \u2018noble son of Laertes, was not lost at sea in any storm of Neptune\u2019s raising, nor did my\nfoes despatch me upon the mainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between them. He\nasked me to his house, feasted me, and then butchered me most miserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaugh-\nter house, while all around me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding breakfast, or picnic, or\ngorgeous banquet of some great nobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general engage-\nment, or in single combat, but you never saw anything so truly pitiable as the way in which we fell in that cloister,\nwith the mixing-bowl and the loaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our-blood. I heard Priam\u2019s\ndaughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close beside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword\nin my body, and raised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me; she would not even\nclose my lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for there is nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as a wom-\nan when she has fallen into such guilt as hers was. Fancy murdering her own husband! I thought I was going to be\nwelcomed home by my children and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace on herself and all\nwomen who shall come after\u2014even on the good ones.\u2019\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to last in the matter of their women\u2019s coun-\nsels. See how many of us fell for Helen\u2019s sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief against too\nduring your absence.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Be sure, therefore,\u2019 continued Agamemnon, \u2018and not be too friendly even with your own wife. Do not tell her\nall that you know perfectly well yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about the rest. Not that\nyour wife, Ulysses, is likely to murder you, for Penelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We\nleft her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up\nhappily to man\u2019s estate, and he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one another as it is right they\nshould do, whereas my wicked wife did not even allow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killed me\nere I could do so. Furthermore I say\u2014and lay my saying to your heart\u2014do not tell people when you are bringing\nyour ship to Ithaca, but steal a march upon them, for after all this there is no trusting women. But now tell me, and\ntell me true, can you give me any news of my son Orestes? Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with\nMenelaus\u2014for I presume that he is still living.\u2019\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether your son is alive or dead, and it is not\nright to talk when one does not know.\u2019\n\u201cAs we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the ghost of Achilles came up to us with Patro-\nclus, Antilochus, and Ajax who was the finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus. The fleet\ndescendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously, saying, \u2018Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daring will\nyou undertake next, that you venture down to the house of Hades among us silly dead, who are but the ghosts of\nthem that can labour no more?\u2019\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, I came to consult Teiresias, and see\n284 The Odyssey\nif he could advise me about my return home to Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get near the Achaean land,\nnor to set foot in my own country, but have been in trouble all the time. As for you, Achilles, no one was ever yet\nso fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored by all us Argives as long as you were alive, and\nnow that you are here you are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take it so much to heart even if you\nare dead.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Say not a word,\u2019 he answered, \u2018in death\u2019s favour; I would rather be a paid servant in a poor man\u2019s house and be\nabove ground than king of kings among the dead. But give me news about son; is he gone to the wars and will he be\na great soldier, or is this not so? Tell me also if you have heard anything about my father Peleus\u2014does he still rule\namong the Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect throughout Hellas and Phthia now that he is old and his\nlimbs fail him? Could I but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the same strength that I had when I killed the\nbravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy\u2014could I but be as I then was and go even for a short time to my father\u2019s\nhouse, any one who tried to do him violence or supersede him would soon me it.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019I have heard nothing,\u2019 I answered, \u2018of Peleus, but I can tell you all about your son Neoptolemus, for I took him\nin my own ship from Scyros with the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always first to speak, and\nhis judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the only two who could surpass him; and when it came to fighting\non the plain of Troy, he would never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of\nthem all in valour. Many a man did he kill in battle\u2014I cannot name every single one of those whom he slew while\nfighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say how he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of Telephus, who\nwas the handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of the Ceteians fell around him by reason\nof a woman\u2019s bribes. Moreover, when all the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeus had made, and\nit was left to me to settle when we should either open the door of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other\nleaders and chief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in every limb, I never once saw him\nturn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek; he was all the time urging me to break out from the horse\u2014grasping the\nhandle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city\nof Priam he got his handsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the fortune of war) without a\nwound upon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat, for the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.\u2019\n\u201cWhen I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a meadow full of asphodel, exulting over what\nI had said concerning the prowess of his son.\n\u201cThe ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own melancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of\nTelamon alone held aloof\u2014still angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about the armour of Achil-\nles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners and Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never\ngained the day in such a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, who was foremost of all the Danaans after the son of\nPeleus, alike in stature and prowess.\n\u201cWhen I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, \u2018Ajax, will you not forget and forgive even in death, but must\nthe judgement about that hateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to lose such a tower\nof strength as you were to us. We mourned you as much as we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself, nor can the\nblame be laid on anything but on the spite which Jove bore against the Danaans, for it was this that made him coun-\nsel your destruction\u2014come hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit into subjection, and hear what I can tell you.\u2019\n\u201cHe would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other ghosts; nevertheless, I should have made\nhim talk to me in spite of his being so angry, or I should have gone talking to him, only that there were still others\namong the dead whom I desired to see.\n\u201cThen I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand sitting in judgement on the dead, and the\nghosts were gathered sitting and standing round him in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his sentences upon\nthem.\n\u201cAfter him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the ghosts of the wild beasts that he had\nkilled upon the mountains, and he had a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.\n\u201cAnd I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering some nine acres of ground. Two vultures\non either side of him were digging their beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beat them off with his hands,\nbut could not; for he had violated Jove\u2019s mistress Leto as she was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho.\n\u201cI saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake that reached his chin; he was dying to quench his\nthirst, but could never reach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped to drink, it dried up and vanished,\nso that there was nothing but dry ground\u2014parched by the spite of heaven. There were tall trees, moreover, that\nshed their fruit over his head\u2014pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet figs and juicy olives, but whenever the poor crea-\nture stretched out his hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches back again to the clouds.\n\u201cAnd I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone with both his hands. With hands and feet\nhe\u2019 tried to roll it up to the top of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it over on to the other side, its weight\nwould be too much for him, and the pitiless stone would come thundering down again on to the plain. Then he\n285 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nwould begin trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ran off him and the steam rose after him.\n\u201cAfter him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for he is feasting ever with the immortal gods,\nand has lovely Hebe to wife, who is daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming round him like scared\nbirds flying all whithers. He looked black as night with his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string, glar-\ning around as though ever on the point of taking aim. About his breast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned\nin the most marvellous fashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes; there was also war, battle, and\ndeath. The man who made that belt, do what he might, would never be able to make another like it. Hercules knew\nme at once when he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, my poor Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, are you too leading\nthe same sorry kind of life that I did when I was above ground? I was son of Jove, but I went through an infinity of\nsuffering, for I became bondsman to one who was far beneath me\u2014a low fellow who set me all manner of labours.\nHe once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound\u2014for he did not think he could find anything harder for me than this,\nbut I got the hound out of Hades and brought him to him, for Mercury and Minerva helped me.\u2019\n\u201cOn this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I stayed where I was in case some other of the\nmighty dead should come to me. And I should have seen still other of them that are gone before, whom I would\nfain have seen\u2014Theseus and Pirithous glorious children of the gods, but so many thousands of ghosts came round\nme and uttered such appalling cries, that I was panic stricken lest Proserpine should send up from the house of Ha-\ndes the head of that awful monster Gorgon. On this I hastened back to my ship and ordered my men to go on board\nat once and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took their places, whereon the ship went down the stream of\nthe river Oceanus. We had to row at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up.\nBook XII\n\u201cAFTER we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out into the open sea, we went on till we reached the\nAeaean island where there is dawn and sunrise as in other places. We then drew our ship on to the sands and got\nout of her on to the shore, where we went to sleep and waited till day should break.\n\u201cThen, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I sent some men to Circe\u2019s house to fetch the\nbody of Elpenor. We cut firewood from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, and after we had wept\nover him and lamented him we performed his funeral rites. When his body and armour had been burned to ashes,\nwe raised a cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed the oar that he had been used to row with.\n\u201cWhile we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got back from the house of Hades, dressed herself\nand came to us as fast as she could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread, meat, and wine. Then\nshe stood in the midst of us and said, \u2018You have done a bold thing in going down alive to the house of Hades, and\nyou will have died twice, to other people\u2019s once; now, then, stay here for the rest of the day, feast your fill, and go on\nwith your voyage at daybreak tomorrow morning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses about your course, and will\nexplain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering from misadventure either by land or sea.\u2019\n\u201cWe agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong day to the going down of the sun, but when\nthe sun had set and it came on dark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship. Then\nCirce took me by the hand and bade me be seated away from the others, while she reclined by my side and asked\nme all about our adventures.\n\u201c\u2019So far so good,\u2019 said she, when I had ended my story, \u2018and now pay attention to what I am about to tell you\u2014\nheaven itself, indeed, will recall it to your recollection. First you will come to the Sirens who enchant all who come\nnear them. If any one unwarily draws in too close and hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will nev-\ner welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and warble him to death with the sweetness of their song.\nThere is a great heap of dead men\u2019s bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting off them. Therefore pass these\nSirens by, and stop your men\u2019s ears with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen yourself, for\nyou may get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross-piece half way up the mast, and they must lash the\nrope\u2019s ends to the mast itself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and pray the men to unloose\nyou, then they must bind you faster.\n\u201c\u2019When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you coherent directions as to which of two\ncourses you are to take; I will lay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them for yourself. On the\none hand there are some overhanging rocks against which the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific\nfury; the blessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird may pass, no, not even the timid doves\nthat bring ambrosia to Father Jove, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Jove has to send\nanother to make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to these rocks has got away again, but the waves and\nwhirlwinds of fire are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only vessel that ever sailed and\ngot through, was the famous Argo on her way from the house of Aetes, and she too would have gone against these\ngreat rocks, only that Juno piloted her past them for the love she bore to Jason.\n286 The Odyssey\n\u201c\u2019Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a dark cloud. This never leaves it, so that\nthe top is never clear not even in summer and early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands and twenty feet\ncould get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer up, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the middle\nof it there is a large cavern, looking West and turned towards Erebus; you must take your ship this way, but the cave\nis so high up that not even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it. Inside it Scylla sits and yelps with a voice\nthat you might take to be that of a young hound, but in truth she is a dreadful monster and no one\u2014not even a\ngod\u2014could face her without being terror-struck. She has twelve mis-shapen feet, and six necks of the most prodi-\ngious length; and at the end of each neck she has a frightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very close\ntogether, so that they would crunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep within her shady cell thrusting\nout her heads and peering all round the rock, fishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she can\ncatch, of the thousands with which Amphitrite teems. No ship ever yet got past her without losing some men, for\nshe shoots out all her heads at once, and carries off a man in each mouth.\n\u201c\u2019You will find the other rocks lie lower, but they are so close together that there is not more than a bowshot\nbetween them. [A large fig tree in full leaf grows upon it], and under it lies the sucking whirlpool of Charybdis.\nThree times in the day does she vomit forth her waters, and three times she sucks them down again; see that you be\nnot there when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune himself could not save you; you must hug the Scylla side and\ndrive ship by as fast as you can, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Is there no way,\u2019 said I, \u2018of escaping Charybdis, and at the same time keeping Scylla off when she is trying to\nharm my men?\u2019\n\u201c\u2019You dare-devil,\u2019 replied the goddess, you are always wanting to fight somebody or something; you will not let\nyourself be beaten even by the immortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage, extreme, rude, cruel and\ninvincible. There is no help for it; your best chance will be to get by her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle\nabout her rock while you are putting on your armour, she may catch you with a second cast of her six heads, and\nsnap up another half dozen of your men; so drive your ship past her at full speed, and roar out lustily to Crataiis\nwho is Scylla\u2019s dam, bad luck to her; she will then stop her from making a second raid upon you.\n\u201c\u2019You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will see many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep\nbelonging to the sun-god\u2014seven herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each flock. They do not\nbreed, nor do they become fewer in number, and they are tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, who\nare children of the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she had borne them and had done suckling\nthem sent them to the Thrinacian island, which was a long way off, to live there and look after their father\u2019s flocks\nand herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think of nothing but getting home, you may yet after much\nhardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and of your\ncomrades; and even though you may yourself escape, you will return late, in bad plight, after losing all your men.\u2019\n\u201cHere she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven, whereon she returned inland. I then\nwent on board and told my men to loose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her, took their places,\nand began to smite the grey sea with their oars. Presently the great and cunning goddess Circe befriended us with\na fair wind that blew dead aft, and stayed steadily with us, keeping our sails well filled, so we did whatever wanted\ndoing to the ship\u2019s gear, and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her.\n\u201cThen, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, \u2018My friends, it is not right that one or two of us alone\nshould know the prophecies that Circe has made me, I will therefore tell you about them, so that whether we live\nor die we may do so with our eyes open. First she said we were to keep clear of the Sirens, who sit and sing most\nbeautifully in a field of flowers; but she said I might hear them myself so long as no one else did. Therefore, take me\nand bind me to the crosspiece half way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a bond so fast that I cannot\npossibly break away, and lash the rope\u2019s ends to the mast itself. If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me\nmore tightly still.\u2019\n\u201cI had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we reached the island of the two Sirens, for the\nwind had been very favourable. Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a breath of wind nor a ripple\nupon the water, so the men furled the sails and stowed them; then taking to their oars they whitened the water with\nthe foam they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax and cut it up small with my sword. Then I\nkneaded the wax in my strong hands till it became soft, which it soon did between the kneading and the rays of the\nsun-god son of Hyperion. Then I stopped the ears of all my men, and they bound me hands and feet to the mast as\nI stood upright on the crosspiece; but they went on rowing themselves. When we had got within earshot of the land,\nand the ship was going at a good rate, the Sirens saw that we were getting in shore and began with their singing.\n\u201c\u2019Come here,\u2019 they sang, \u2018renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean name, and listen to our two voices. No one\never sailed past us without staying to hear the enchanting sweetness of our song\u2014and he who listens will go on his\nway not only charmed, but wiser, for we know all the ills that the gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans before\nTroy, and can tell you everything that is going to happen over the whole world.\u2019\n287 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u201cThey sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear them further I made by frowning to my men\nthat they should set me free; but they quickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes bound me with still\nstronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the Sirens\u2019 voices. Then my men took the wax from their ears and\nunbound me.\n\u201cImmediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave from which spray was rising, and I heard a\nloud roaring sound. The men were so frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole sea resound-\ned with the rushing of the waters, but the ship stayed where it was, for the men had left off rowing. I went round,\ntherefore, and exhorted them man by man not to lose heart.\n\u201c\u2019My friends,\u2019 said I, \u2018this is not the first time that we have been in danger, and we are in nothing like so bad a\ncase as when the Cyclops shut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel saved us then, and we\nshall live to look back on all this as well. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say, trust in Jove and row on with might\nand main. As for you, coxswain, these are your orders; attend to them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head\naway from these steaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and be over yonder before you know\nwhere you are, and you will be the death of us.\u2019\n\u201cSo they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster Scylla, for I knew the men would not\non rowing if I did, but would huddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe\u2019s strict instruc-\ntions\u2014I put on my armour. Then seizing two strong spears I took my stand on the ship Is bows, for it was there that\nI expected first to see the monster of the rock, who was to do my men so much harm; but I could not make her out\nanywhere, though I strained my eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over\n\u201cThen we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one hand was Scylla, and on the other dread Cha-\nrybdis kept sucking up the salt water. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when it is boiling over\nupon a great fire, and the spray reached the top of the rocks on either side. When she began to suck again, we could\nsee the water all inside whirling round and round, and it made a deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. We\ncould see the bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the men were at their wit\u2019s ends for fear.\nWhile we were taken up with this, and were expecting each moment to be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly\nupon us and snatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after both ship and men, and in a moment I saw\ntheir hands and feet ever so high above me, struggling in the air as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them\ncall out my name in one last despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon some jutting rock throws\nbait into the water to deceive the poor little fishes, and spears them with the ox\u2019s horn with which his spear is shod,\nthrowing them gasping on to the land as he catches them one by one\u2014even so did Scylla land these panting crea-\ntures on her rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they screamed and stretched out their hands\nto me in their mortal agony. This was the most sickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.\n\u201cWhen we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible Charybdis, we reached the noble island\nof the sun-god, where were the goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still at sea in my ship\nI could bear the cattle lowing as they came home to the yards, and the sheep bleating. Then I remembered what the\nblind Theban prophet Teiresias had told me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe had warned me to shun the island of\nthe blessed sun-god. So being much troubled I said to the men, \u2018My men, I know you are hard pressed, but listen\nwhile I tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe warned me to shun the island\nof the blessed sun-god, for it was here, she said, that our worst danger would lie. Head the ship, therefore, away\nfrom the island.\u2019\n\u201cThe men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me an insolent answer. \u2018Ulysses,\u2019 said he, \u2018you are\ncruel; you are very strong yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron, and now, though your men\nare exhausted with toil and want of sleep, you will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon this\nisland, but bid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly on through the watches of the flying night. It is by night\nthat the winds blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should one of those sudden squalls spring\nup from South West or West, which so often wreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now, there-\nfore, let us obey the of night and prepare our supper here hard by the ship; to-morrow morning we will go on board\nagain and put out to sea.\u2019\n\u201cThus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that heaven meant us a mischief and said, \u2018You\nforce me to yield, for you are many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his solemn oath that if he\nmeet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either, but will be\nsatisfied with the food that Circe has given us.\u2019\n\u201cThey all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their oath we made the ship fast in a harbour\nthat was near a stream of fresh water, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as they had had\nenough to eat and drink, they began talking about their poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten;\nthis set them weeping and they went on crying till they fell off into a sound sleep.\n\u201cIn the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their places, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew\n288 The Odyssey\na hurricane so that land and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. When\nthe child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave wherein\nthe sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I called the men together in council.\n\u201c\u2019My friends,\u2019 said I, \u2018we have meat and drink in the ship, let us mind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we\nshall suffer for it; for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees and gives ear to everything. And\nagain they promised that they would obey.\n\u201cFor a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there was no other wind, but only South and\nEast. As long as corn and wine held out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when, however,\nthey had eaten all there was in the ship, they were forced to go further afield, with hook and line, catching birds,\nand taking whatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving. One day, therefore, I went up inland that\nI might pray heaven to show me some means of getting away. When I had gone far enough to be clear of all my\nmen, and had found a place that was well sheltered from the wind, I washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in\nOlympus till by and by they sent me off into a sweet sleep.\n\u201cMeanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men, \u2018Listen to me,\u2019 said he, \u2018my poor comrades. All\ndeaths are bad enough but there is none so bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best of these cows and\noffer them in sacrifice to the immortal Rods? If we ever get back to Ithaca, we can build a fine temple to the sun-god\nand enrich it with every kind of ornament; if, however, he is determined to sink our ship out of revenge for these\nhomed cattle, and the other gods are of the same mind, I for one would rather drink salt water once for all and have\ndone with it, than be starved to death by inches in such a desert island as this is.\u2019\n\u201cThus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the cattle, so fair and goodly, were feeding not\nfar from the ship; the men, therefore drove in the best of them, and they all stood round them saying their prayers,\nand using young oak-shoots instead of barley-meal, for there was no barley left. When they had done praying they\nkilled the cows and dressed their carcasses; they cut out the thigh bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat,\nand set some pieces of raw meat on top of them. They had no wine with which to make drink-offerings over the\nsacrifice while it was cooking, so they kept pouring on a little water from time to time while the inward meats were\nbeing grilled; then, when the thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up\nsmall and put the pieces upon the spits.\n\u201cBy this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the ship and to the sea shore. As I drew near I\nbegan to smell hot roast meat, so I groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods. \u2018Father Jove,\u2019 I exclaimed, \u2018and all you\nother gods who live in everlasting bliss, you have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep into which you have sent\nme; see what fine work these men of mine have been making in my absence.\u2019\n\u201cMeanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had been killing his cows, whereon he flew\ninto a great rage, and said to the immortals, \u2018Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss, I must\nhave vengeance on the crew of Ulysses\u2019 ship: they have had the insolence to kill my cows, which were the one thing\nI loved to look upon, whether I was going up heaven or down again. If they do not square accounts with me about\nmy cows, I will go down to Hades and shine there among the dead.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Sun,\u2019 said Jove, \u2018go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over the fruitful earth. I will shiver their ship\ninto little pieces with a bolt of white lightning as soon as they get out to sea.\u2019\n\u201cI was told all this by Calypso, who said she had heard it from the mouth of Mercury.\n\u201cAs soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebuked each one of the men separately, but we could\nsee no way out of it, for the cows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once to show signs and wonders\namong us, for the hides of the cattle crawled about, and the joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and the\nmeat, whether cooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.\n\u201cFor six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon them, but when Jove the son of Saturn\nhad added a seventh day, the fury of the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts, spread sail, and\nput out to sea. As soon as we were well away from the island, and could see nothing but sky and sea, the son of Sat-\nurn raised a black cloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath it. We not get on much further, for in another\nmoment we were caught by a terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of the mast so that it fell aft,\nwhile all the ship\u2019s gear tumbled about at the bottom of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in\nthe ship\u2019s stern, so that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell overboard as though he were div-\ning, with no more life left in him.\n\u201cThen Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round and round, and was filled with fire and brim-\nstone as the lightning struck it. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship,\nlooking like so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of getting home again.\n\u201cI stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel (which drifted about by itself) and struck the\nmast out of her in the direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong still hanging about it, and\nwith this I lashed the mast and keel together, and getting astride of them was carried wherever the winds chose to\n289 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ntake me.\n\u201c[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got into the South again, which frightened me\nlest I should be taken back to the terrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually happened, for I\nwas borne along by the waves all night, and by sunrise had reacfied the rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was\nthen sucking down the salt sea water, but I was carried aloft toward the fig tree, which I caught hold of and clung\non to like a bat. I could not plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for the roots were a long way off and the\nboughs that overshadowed the whole pool were too high, too vast, and too far apart for me to reach them; so I hung\npatiently on, waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft again\u2014and a very long while it seemed. A ju-\nryman is not more glad to get home to supper, after having been long detained in court by troublesome cases, than I\nwas to see my raft beginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. At last I let go with my hands and feet, and\nfell heavily into the sea, bard by my raft on to which I then got, and began to row with my hands. As for Scylla, the\nfather of gods and men would not let her get further sight of me\u2014otherwise I should have certainly been lost.]\n\u201cHence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the gods stranded me on the Ogygian island,\nwhere dwells the great and powerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but I need say no more\nabout this, for I told you and your noble wife all about it yesterday, and I hate saying the same thing over and over\nagain.\u201d\nBook XIII\nTHUS did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered cloister, enthralled by the charm of\nhis story, till presently Alcinous began to speak.\n\u201cUlysses,\u201d said he, \u201cnow that you have reached my house I doubt not you will get home without further misad-\nventure no matter how much you have suffered in the past. To you others, however, who come here night after night\nto drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard, I would insist as follows. Our guest has already packed up the\nclothes, wrought gold, and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance; let us now, therefore, present\nhim further, each one of us, with a large tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a general\nrate; for private individuals cannot be expected to bear the burden of such a handsome present.\u201d\nEvery one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each in his own abode. When the child of morn-\ning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them. Alcinous\nwent on board and saw everything so securely stowed under the ship\u2019s benches that nothing could break adrift and\ninjure the rowers. Then they went to the house of Alcinous to get dinner, and he sacrificed a bull for them in hon-\nour of Jove who is the lord of all. They set the steaks to grill and made an excellent dinner, after which the inspired\nbard, Demodocus, who was a favourite with every one, sang to them; but Ulysses kept on turning his eyes towards\nthe sun, as though to hasten his setting, for he was longing to be on his way. As one who has been all day ploughing\na fallow field with a couple of oxen keeps thinking about his supper and is glad when night comes that he may go\nand get it, for it is all his legs can do to carry him, even so did Ulysses rejoice when the sun went down, and he at\nonce said to the Phaecians, addressing himself more particularly to King Alcinous:\n\u201cSir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send me on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled\nmy heart\u2019s desire by giving me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I may turn to good\naccount; may I find my admirable wife living in peace among friends, and may you whom I leave behind me give\nsatisfaction to your wives and children; may heaven vouchsafe you every good grace, and may no evil thing come\namong your people.\u201d\nThus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and agreed that he should have his escort inas-\nmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Alcinous therefore said to his servant, \u201cPontonous, mix some wine and hand it\nround to everybody, that we may offer a prayer to father Jove, and speed our guest upon his way.\u201d\nPontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the others each from his own seat made a\ndrink-offering to the blessed gods that live in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the hands of\nqueen Arete.\n\u201cFarewell, queen,\u201d said he, \u201chenceforward and for ever, till age and death, the common lot of mankind, lay their\nhands upon you. I now take my leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people, and with king Alci-\nnous.\u201d\nAs he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to conduct him to his ship and to the sea shore.\nArete also sent some maid servants with him\u2014one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to carry his strong-box,\nand a third with corn and wine. When they got to the water side the crew took these things and put them on board,\nwith all the meat and drink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly\nin the stern of the ship. Then he too went on board and lay down without a word, but the crew took every man his\nplace and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone to which it had been bound. Thereon, when they began rowing\n290 The Odyssey\nout to sea, Ulysses fell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike slumber.\nThe ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies over the course when the horses feel the\nwhip. Her prow curveted as it were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water seethed in her wake.\nShe held steadily on her course, and even a falcon, swiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her. Thus,\nthen, she cut her way through the water. carrying one who was as cunning as the gods, but who was now sleeping\npeacefully, forgetful of all that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea.\nWhen the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show. the ship drew near to land. Now there is\nin Ithaca a haven of the old merman Phorcys, which lies between two points that break the line of the sea and shut\nthe harbour in. These shelter it from the storms of wind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within it, a\nship may lie without being even moored. At the head of this harbour there is a large olive tree, and at no distance a\nfine overarching cavern sacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads. There are mixing-bowls within it and wine-\njars of stone, and the bees hive there. Moreover, there are great looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their\nrobes of sea purple\u2014very curious to see\u2014and at all times there is water within it. It has two entrances, one facing\nNorth by which mortals can go down into the cave, while the other comes from the South and is more mysterious;\nmortals cannot possibly get in by it, it is the way taken by the gods.\nInto this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the place, She had so much way upon her that she\nran half her own length on to the shore; when, however, they had landed, the first thing they did was to lift Ulysses\nwith his rug and linen sheet out of the ship, and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took out the\npresents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to give him when he was setting out on his voyage home-\nwards. They put these all together by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear some passer by might\ncome and steal them before Ulysses awoke; and then they made the best of their way home again.\nBut Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already threatened Ulysses, so he took counsel with\nJove. \u201cFather Jove,\u201d said he, \u201cI shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods, if mortals like the\nPhaeacians, who are my own flesh and blood, show such small regard for me. I said I would Ulysses get home when\nhe had suffered sufficiently. I did not say that he should never get home at all, for I knew you had already nodded\nyour head about it, and promised that he should do so; but now they have brought him in a ship fast asleep and\nhave landed him in Ithaca after loading him with more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and raiment than he\nwould ever have brought back from Troy, if he had had his share of the spoil and got home without misadventure.\u201d\nAnd Jove answered, \u201cWhat, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking about? The gods are by no means want-\ning in respect for you. It would be monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are. As regards\nmortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence and treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with\nyourself to deal with him as you may think proper, so do just as you please.\u201d\n\u201cI should have done so at once,\u201d replied Neptune, \u201cif I were not anxious to avoid anything that might displease\nyou; now, therefore, I should like to wreck the Phaecian ship as it is returning from its escort. This will stop them\nfrom escorting people in future; and I should also like to bury their city under a huge mountain.\u201d\n\u201cMy good friend,\u201d answered Jove, \u201cI should recommend you at the very moment when the people from the\ncity are watching the ship on her way, to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship. This will astonish\neverybody, and you can then bury their city under the mountain.\u201d\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where the Phaecians live, and stayed there till the\nship, which was making rapid way, had got close-in. Then he went up to it, turned it into stone, and drove it down\nwith the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground. After this he went away.\nThe Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would turn towards his neighbour, saying,\n\u201cBless my heart, who is it that can have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port? We could see the\nwhole of her only moment ago.\u201d\nThis was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous said, \u201cI remember now the old prophe-\ncy of my father. He said that Neptune would be angry with us for taking every one so safely over the sea, and would\none day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning from an escort, and bury our city under a high mountain. This\nwas what my old father used to say, and now it is all coming true. Now therefore let us all do as I say; in the first\nplace we must leave off giving people escorts when they come here, and in the next let us sacrifice twelve picked\nbulls to Neptune that he may have mercy upon us, and not bury our city under the high mountain.\u201d When the peo-\nple heard this they were afraid and got ready the bulls.\nThus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaecians to king Neptune, standing round his altar; and at the same time\nUlysses woke up once more upon his own soil. He had been so long away that he did not know it again; moreover,\nJove\u2019s daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so that people might not know of his having come, and that she\nmight tell him everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens and friends recognizing him until he had\ntaken his revenge upon the wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to him\u2014the long straight\ntracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the goodly trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his\n291 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nnative land. So he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried aloud despairingly.\n\u201cAlas,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201camong what manner of people am I fallen? Are they savage and uncivilized or hospita-\nble and humane? Where shall I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I had stayed over there with\nthe Phaeacians; or I could have gone to some other great chief who would have been good to me and given me an\nescort. As it is I do not know where to put my treasure, and I cannot leave it here for fear somebody else should get\nhold of it. In good truth the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by me, and have left me\nin the wrong country; they said they would take me back to Ithaca and they have not done so: may Jove the protec-\ntor of suppliants chastise them, for he watches over everybody and punishes those who do wrong. Still, I suppose I\nmust count my goods and see if the crew have gone off with any of them.\u201d\nHe counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his clothes, but there was nothing missing; still\nhe kept grieving about not being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore of the sounding sea\nbewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up to him disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien,\nwith a good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her comely feet and held a javelin in her\nhand. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and went straight up to her.\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d said he, \u201cyou are the first person whom I have met with in this country; I salute you, therefore, and\nbeg you to be will disposed towards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your knees and pray\nto you as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell me truly, what land and country is this? Who are its inhabi-\ntants? Am I on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?\u201d\nMinerva answered, \u201cStranger, you must be very simple, or must have come from somewhere a long way off, not\nto know what country this is. It is a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is rugged and\nnot a good driving country, but it is by no means a bid island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of corn\nand also wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here,\nand there are watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of Ithaca is known even as far as\nTroy, which I understand to be a long way off from this Achaean country.\u201d\nUlysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own country, and he began to answer, but he\ndid not speak the truth, and made up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.\n\u201cI heard of Ithaca,\u201d said he, \u201cwhen I was in Crete beyond the seas, and now it seems I have reached it with all\nthese treasures. I have left as much more behind me for my children, but am flying because I killed Orsilochus son\nof Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from\nTroy with so much trouble and danger both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; he said I had\nnot served his father loyally at Troy as vassal, but had set myself up as an independent ruler, so I lay in wait for\nhim and with one of my followers by the road side, and speared him as he was coming into town from the country.\nmy It was a very dark night and nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but as soon as I\nhad done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who were Phoenicians, to take me on board and set me in\nPylos or in Elis where the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them. They meant no guile, but the\nwind drove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could do to get inside\nthe harbour, and none of us said a word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay\ndown just as we were. I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took my goods out of the ship, and placed\nthem beside me where I was lying upon the sand. Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here in great\ndistress of mind.\u201d\nSuch was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand. Then she took the form of a woman,\nfair, stately, and wise, \u201cHe must be indeed a shifty lying fellow,\u201d said she, \u201cwho could surpass you in all manner of\ncraft even though you had a god for your antagonist. Dare-devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit,\ncan you not drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now that you are in your own country again? We\nwill say no more, however, about this, for we can both of us deceive upon occasion\u2014you are the most accomplished\ncounsellor and orator among all mankind, while I for diplomacy and subtlety have no equal among the gods. Did\nyou not know Jove\u2019s daughter Minerva \u2014 me, who have been ever with you, who kept watch over you in all your\ntroubles, and who made the Phaeacians take so great a liking to you? And now, again, I am come here to talk things\nover with you, and help you to hide the treasure I made the Phaeacians give you; I want to tell you about the trou-\nbles that await you in your own house; you have got to face them, but tell no one, neither man nor woman, that you\nhave come home again. Bear everything, and put up with every man\u2019s insolence, without a word.\u201d\nAnd Ulysses answered, \u201cA man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you are so constantly changing your ap-\npearance that when he meets you it is a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not. This much, however,\nI know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me as long as we Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the\nday on which we went on board ship after having sacked the city of Priam, and heaven dispersed us\u2014from that day,\nMinerva, I saw no more of you, and cannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in a difficulty; I had\nto wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from evil and I reached the city of the Phaeacians, where you\n292 The Odyssey\nencouraged me and took me into the town. And now, I beseech you in your father\u2019s name, tell me the truth, for I do\nnot believe I am really back in Ithaca. I am in some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in all\nyou have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own country?\u201d\n\u201cYou are always taking something of that sort into your head,\u201d replied Minerva, \u201cand that is why I cannot desert\nyou in your afflictions; you are so plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning from so long a\nvoyage would at once have gone home to see his wife and children, but you do not seem to care about asking after\nthem or hearing any news about them till you have exploited your wife, who remains at home vainly grieving for\nyou, and having no peace night or day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming near you, I was\nnever uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back safely though you would lose all your men, and I did\nnot wish to quarrel with my uncle Neptune, who never forgave you for having blinded his son. I will now, howev-\ner, point out to you the lie of the land, and you will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven of the old merman\nPhorcys, and here is the olive tree that grows at the head of it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;] here too\nis the overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable hecatomb to the nymphs, and this is the\nwooded mountain Neritum.\u201d\nAs she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself\nagain in his own land, and kissed the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs, saying,\n\u201cNaiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never again to see you, now therefore I greet you with all\nloving salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in the old days, if Jove\u2019s redoubtable daughter will grant me life,\nand bring my son to manhood.\u201d\n\u201cTake heart, and do not trouble yourself about that,\u201d rejoined Minerva, \u201clet us rather set about stowing your\nthings at once in the cave, where they will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it all.\u201d\nTherewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding places, while Ulysses brought up all the\ntreasure of gold, bronze, and good clothing which the Phaecians had given him. They stowed everything carefully\naway, and Minerva set a stone against the door of the cave. Then the two sat down by the root of the great olive, and\nconsulted how to compass the destruction of the wicked suitors.\n\u201cUlysses,\u201d said Minerva, \u201cnoble son of Laertes, think how you can lay hands on these disreputable people who\nhave been lording it in your house these three years, courting your wife and making wedding presents to her, while\nshe does nothing but lament your absence, giving hope and sending your encouraging messages to every one of\nthem, but meaning the very opposite of all she says\u2019\nAnd Ulysses answered, \u201cIn good truth, goddess, it seems I should have come to much the same bad end in my\nown house as Agamemnon did, if you had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall best avenge\nmyself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my heart as on the day when we loosed Troy\u2019s fair diadem from\nher brow. Help me now as you did then, and I will fight three hundred men, if you, goddess, will be with me.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me for that,\u201d said she, \u201cI will not lose sight of you when once we set about it, and I would imagine that\nsome of those who are devouring your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their blood and brains. I\nwill begin by disguising you so that no human being shall know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; you shall\nlose all your yellow hair; I will clothe you in a garment that shall fill all who see it with loathing; I will blear your\nfine eyes for you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the suitors, of your wife, and of the son whom\nyou left behind you. Then go at once to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has been always well affect-\ned towards you, and is devoted to Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that is\ncalled Raven by the fountain Arethusa, where they are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their manner.\nStay with him and find out how things are going, while I proceed to Sparta and see your son, who is with Menelaus\nat Lacedaemon, where he has gone to try and find out whether you are still alive.\u201d\n\u201cBut why,\u201d said Ulysses, \u201cdid you not tell him, for you knew all about it? Did you want him too to go sailing\nabout amid all kinds of hardship while others are eating up his estate?\u201d\nMinerva answered, \u201cNever mind about him, I sent him that he might be well spoken of for having gone. He is\nin no sort of difficulty, but is staying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with abundance of every\nkind. The suitors have put out to sea and are lying in wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home.\nI do not much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those who are now eating up your estate will first\nfind a grave themselves.\u201d\nAs she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with wrinkles, took away all his yellow\nhair, and withered the flesh over his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine ones; she\nchanged his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about him, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with\nsmoke; she also gave him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished him with a staff and a wallet\nall in holes, with a twisted thong for him to sling it over his shoulder.\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess went straight to Lacedaemon to fetch\nTelemachus.\n293 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nBook XIV\nULYSSES now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the wooded country and over the crest of\nthe mountain till he reached the place where Minerva had said that he would find the swineherd, who was the\nmost thrifty servant he had. He found him sitting in front of his hut, which was by the yards that he had built on a\nsite which could be seen from far. He had made them spacious and fair to see, with a free ran for the pigs all round\nthem; he had built them during his master\u2019s absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground, without\nsaying anything to Penelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them on top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had\nrun a strong fence of oaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while inside lie had built twelve sties near one\nanother for the sows to lie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing in each sty, all of them breeding sows; but the boars\nslept outside and were much fewer in number, for the suitors kept on eating them, and die swineherd had to send\nthem the best he had continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman\u2019s four hounds,\nwhich were as fierce as wolves, slept always with them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of\nsandals from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding the pigs in one place or another, and he had\nsent the fourth to town with a boar that he had been forced to send the suitors that they might sacrifice it and have\ntheir fill of meat.\nWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at him, but Ulysses was cunning enough\nto sit down and loose his hold of the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn by them in his own\nhomestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox hide, rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven\nthe dogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to Ulysses, \u201cOld man, the dogs were likely to\nhave made short work of you, and then you would have got me into trouble. The gods have given me quite enough\nworries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am in continual grief on his account. I have to attend\nswine for other people to eat, while he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving in some distant land. But\ncome inside, and when you have had your fill of bread and wine, tell me where you come from, and all about your\nmisfortunes.\u201d\nOn this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down. He strewed a good thick bed of rushes\nupon the floor, and on the top of this he threw the shaggy chamois skin\u2014a great thick one\u2014on which he used to\nsleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome, and said \u201cMay Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods\ngrant you your heart\u2019s desire in return for the kind way in which you have received me.\u201d\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \u201cStranger, though a still poorer man should come here, it would\nnot be right for me to insult him, for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what you can get and\nbe thankful, for servants live in fear when they have young lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now,\nfor heaven has hindered the return of him who would have been always good to me and given me something of\nmy own\u2014a house, a piece of land, a good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who has\nworked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as they have mine in the situation which I hold. If\nmy master had grown old here he would have done great things by me, but he is gone, and I wish that Helen\u2019s whole\nrace were utterly destroyed, for she has been the death of many a good man. It was this matter that took my master\nto Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans in the cause of kin Agamemnon.\u201d\nAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the sties where the young sucking pigs were penned.\nHe picked out two which he brought back with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted on\nthem; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before Ulysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon\nUlysses sprinkled it over with white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of ivy-wood, and taking\na seat opposite Ulysses told him to begin.\n\u201cFall to, stranger,\u201d said he, \u201con a dish of servant\u2019s pork. The fat pigs have to go to the suitors, who eat them up\nwithout shame or scruple; but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and respect those who do what\nis lawful and right. Even the fierce free-booters who go raiding on other people\u2019s land, and Jove gives them their\nspoil\u2014even they, when they have filled their ships and got home again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully\nfor judgement; but some god seems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone; they will not, there-\nfore, go back to their own homes and make their offers of marriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force,\nwithout fear or stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice not one victim nor two only, and\nthey take the run of his wine, for he was exceedingly rich. No other great man either in Ithaca or on the mainland is\nas rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men put together. I will tell you what he had. There are twelve herds of\ncattle upon the mainland, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs, while his own men and\nhired strangers feed him twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even large flocks of goats\non the far end of the island, and they are in the charge of excellent goatherds. Each one of these sends the suitors\nthe best goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge of the pigs that you see here, and I have to keep\n294 The Odyssey\npicking out the best I have and sending it to them.\u201d\nThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously without a word, brooding his revenge.\nWhen he had eaten enough and was satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank, filled it\nwith wine, and gave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and said as he took it in his hands, \u201cMy friend, who was this\nmaster of yours that bought you and paid for you, so rich and so powerful as you tell me? You say he perished in the\ncause of King Agamemnon; tell me who he was, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and the other gods\nknow, but I may be able to give you news of him, for I have travelled much.\u201d\nEumaeus answered, \u201cOld man, no traveller who comes here with news will get Ulysses\u2019 wife and son to believe\nhis story. Nevertheless, tramps in want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a word of\ntruth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them\nin, makes much of them, and asks them all manner of questions, crying all the time as women will when they have\nlost their husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty story. But\nthe wolves and birds of prey have long since torn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and his\nbones are lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad business it is for all\nhis friends\u2014for me especially; go where I may I shall never find so good a master, not even if I were to go home to\nmy mother and father where I was bred and born. I do not so much care, however, about my parents now, though\nI should dearly like to see them again in my own country; it is the loss of Ulysses that grieves me most; I cannot\nspeak of him without reverence though he is here no longer, for he was very fond of me, and took such care of me\nthat whereever he may be I shall always honour his memory.\u201d\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d replied Ulysses, \u201cyou are very positive, and very hard of belief about your master\u2019s coming home\nagain, nevertheless I will not merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything for my news till\nhe has actually come, you may then give me a shirt and cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I will\nnot take anything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as I hate hell fire, who lets his poverty tempt him into lying.\nI swear by king Jove, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I have now come, that all\nwill surely happen as I have said it will. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the\nbeginning of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who are ill treating his wife and son.\u201d\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \u201cOld man, you will neither get paid for bringing good news, nor\nwill Ulysses ever come home; drink you wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep on re-\nminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks about my honoured master. As for your oath we will\nlet it alone, but I only wish he may come, as do Penelope, his old father Laertes, and his son Telemachus. I am ter-\nribly unhappy too about this same boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be no worse\nman, face and figure, than his father, but some one, either god or man, has been unsettling his mind, so he has gone\noff to Pylos to try and get news of his father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is coming home, in the\nhope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a name in Ithaca. But let us say no more about him, and leave him to\nbe taken, or else to escape if the son of Saturn holds his hand over him to protect him. And now, old man, tell me\nyour own story; tell me also, for I want to know, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your town and\nparents, what manner of ship you came in, how crew brought you to Ithaca, and from what country they professed\nto come\u2014for you cannot have come by land.\u201d\nAnd Ulysses answered, \u201cI will tell you all about it. If there were meat and wine enough, and we could stay here\nin the hut with nothing to do but to eat and drink while the others go to their work, I could easily talk on for a\nwhole twelve months without ever finishing the story of the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to visit me.\n\u201cI am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well-to-do man, who had many sons born in marriage, whereas I was\nthe son of a slave whom he had purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax (whose lin-\neage I claim, and who was held in the highest honour among the Cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour\nof his sons) put me on the same level with my brothers who had been born in wedlock. When, however, death took\nhim to the house of Hades, his sons divided his estate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a holding\nand little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry into a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or\nshirking on the field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw you can see what the ear was, for I\nhave had trouble enough and to spare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my men to\nsurprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but was the first to leap forward\nand spear all whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not care about farm work, nor the frugal home\nlife of those who would bring up children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows\u2014things that most\nmen shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing and another another, and this was what I was most naturally\ninclined to. Before the Achaeans went to Troy, nine times was I in command of men and ships on foreign service,\nand I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first instance, and much more was allotted to me later\non.\n\u201cMy house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but when Jove counselled that terrible\n295 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nexpedition, in which so many perished, the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to Troy, and\nthere was no way out of it, for they insisted on our doing so. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth\nwe sacked the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it was that Jove devised evil against\nme. I spent but one month happily with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea of making a\ndescent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it. I had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them. For\nsix days I and my men made feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice to the gods and for themselves,\nbut on the seventh day we went on board and set sail from Crete with a fair North wind behind us though we were\ngoing down a river. Nothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but sat where we were\nand let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them. On the fifth day we reached the river Aegyptus; there I\nstationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay by them and keep guard over them while I sent out scouts to\nreconnoitre from every point of vantage.\n\u201cBut the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing\nthe men, and taking their wives and children captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard\nthe war cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the\ngleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found\nthemselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for them. Jove,\nhowever, put it in my mind to do thus\u2014and I wish I had died then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much\nsorrow in store for me\u2014I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand; then I went straight\nup to the king\u2019s chariot, clasped his knees and kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot,\nand took me weeping to his own home. Many made at me with their ashen spears and tried to kil me in their fury,\nbut the king protected me, for he feared the wrath of Jove the protector of strangers, who punishes those who do\nevil.\n\u201cI stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the Egyptians, for they all gave me some-\nthing; but when it was now going on for eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who had\nalready committed all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me over into going with him to Phoenicia, where his\nhouse and his possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but at the end of that time when months\nand days had gone by till the same season had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound for Libya, on a\npretence that I was to take a cargo along with him to that place, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take\nthe money I fetched. I suspected his intention, but went on board with him, for I could not help it.\n\u201cThe ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea that lies between Crete and Libya; there,\nhowever, Jove counselled their destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and could see nothing but\nsea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our ship and the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his thun-\nderbolts and the ship went round and round and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The\nmen fell all into the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship looking like so many sea-gulls, but the\ngod presently deprived them of all chance of getting home again. I was all dismayed; Jove, however, sent the ship\u2019s\nmast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I\ndrift but in the darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on to the Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of\nthe Thesprotians entertained me hospitably without charging me anything at all for his son found me when I was\nnearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he raised me by the hand, took me to his father\u2019s house and gave me\nclothes to wear.\n\u201cThere it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he had entertained him, and shown him much\nhospitality while he was on his homeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and wrought iron that\nUlysses had got together. There was enough to keep his family for ten generations, so much had he left in the house\nof king Pheidon. But the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he might learn Jove\u2019s mind from the god\u2019s high\noak tree, and know whether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or in secret. Moreover the\nking swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in his own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water\nside, and the crew found, that should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before Ulysses returned,\nfor there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in\ncharge of her to be sure and take me safely to King Acastus.\n\u201cThese men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the very extreme of misery, for when the\nship had got some way out from land they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the shirt and cloak\nthat I was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old clouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall,\nthey reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with a strong rope fast in the ship, while they went\non shore to get supper by the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn my rags over\nmy head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where I struck out and swam till I was well clear of them, and came\nashore near a thick wood in which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my having escaped and went searching\nabout for me, till at last they thought it was no further use and went back to their ship. The gods, having hidden me\n296 The Odyssey\nthus easily, then took me to a good man\u2019s door\u2014for it seems that I am not to die yet awhile.\u201d\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \u201cPoor unhappy stranger, I have found the story of your misfor-\ntunes extremely interesting, but that part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to believe it. Why\nshould a man like you go about telling lies in this way? I know all about the return of my master. The gods one and\nall of them detest him, or they would have taken him before Troy, or let him die with friends around him when the\ndays of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and his son would\nhave been heir to his renown, but now the storm winds have spirited him away we know not whither.\n\u201cAs for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to the town unless when Penelope sends for me\non the arrival of some news about Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those who grieve over\nthe king\u2019s absence, and those who rejoice at it because they can eat up his property without paying for it. For my\nown part I have never cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was taken in by an Aetolian, who had\nkilled a man and come a long way till at last he reached my station, and I was very kind to him. He said he had seen\nUlysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses\nwould return in the following summer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back much wealth. And\nnow you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has brought you to my door, do not try to flatter me in this way with\nvain hopes. It is not for any such reason that I shall treat you kindly, but only out of respect for Jove the god of hos-\npitality, as fearing him and pitying you.\u201d\nUlysses answered, \u201cI see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have given you my oath, and yet you will not\ncredit me; let us then make a bargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master comes home, give\nme a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to Dulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say\nhe will, set your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder precepice, as a warning to tramps not to go\nabout the country telling lies.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a pretty figure I should cut then,\u201d replied Eumaeus, both now and hereafter, if I were to kill you after re-\nceiving you into my hut and showing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good earnest if I did; but it\nis just supper time and I hope my men will come in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper.\u201d\nThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with the pigs, which were then shut up for the\nnight in their sties, and a tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them. But Eumaeus\ncalled to his men and said, \u201cBring in the best pig you have, that I may sacrifice for this stranger, and we will take toll\nof him ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs, while others reap the fruit of our labour.\u201d\nOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine fat five year old boar pig, and set it\nat the altar. Eumaeus did not forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the first thing he did was to\ncut bristles from the pig\u2019s face and throw them into the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so that Ulysses might\nreturn home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the\nfirewood, and stunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and Eumaeus began by\nputting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the em-\nbers; they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits and roasted them till they were done; when\nthey had taken them off the spits they threw them on to the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who was a most equi-\ntable man, then stood up to give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he set apart for Mercury\nthe son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He\ngave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much pleased.\n\u201cI hope, Eumaeus,\u201d said he, \u201cthat Jove will be as well disposed towards you as I am, for the respect you are showing\nto an outcast like myself.\u201d\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \u201cEat, my good fellow, and enjoy your supper, such as it is. God\ngrants this, and withholds that, just as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses.\u201d\nAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt sacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them\na drink-offering, put the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion. Mesaulius brought them\ntheir bread; the swineherd had bought this man on his own account from among the Taphians during his master\u2019s\nabsence, and had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either to his mistress or Laertes. They\nthen laid their hands upon the good things that were before them, and when they had had enough to eat and drink,\nMesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all went to bed after having made a hearty supper.\nNow the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. It poured without ceasing, and the\nwind blew strong from the West, which is a wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in the\nexcellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak and give it him, or make one of his men give him one.\n\u201cListen to me,\u201d said he, \u201cEumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell you something. It is the\nwine that makes me talk in this way; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing; it will make him chuckle and\ndance and say many a word that he had better leave unspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Would that I were\nstill young and strong as when we got up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the leaders, but I\n297 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nwas in command also, for the other two would have it so. When we had come up to the wall of the city we crouched\ndown beneath our armour and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brush-wood that grew about the swamp.\nIt came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow fell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were\ncoated thick with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept comfortably enough with their shields\nabout their shoulders, but I had carelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be too cold, and had\ngone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. When the night was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted their\ntheir places, I nudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and he at once gave me his ear.\n\u201c\u2019Ulysses,\u2019 said I, \u2018this cold will be the death of me, for I have no cloak; some god fooled me into setting off with\nnothing on but my shirt, and I do not know what to do.\u2019\n\u201cUlysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following plan:\n\u201c\u2019Keep still,\u2019 said he in a low voice, \u2018or the others will hear you.\u2019 Then he raised his head on his elbow.\n\u201c\u2019My friends,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We are a long way from the ships; I wish\nsome one would go down and tell Agamemnon to send us up more men at once.\u2019\n\u201cOn this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running to the ships, whereon I took the\ncloak and lay in it comfortably enough till morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in those days,\nfor then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak both out of good will and for the respect due to a brave\nsoldier; but now people look down upon me because my clothes are shabby.\u201d\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \u201cOld man, you have told us an excellent story, and have said nothing so far but what is\nquite satisfactory; for the present, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else that a stranger in dis-\ntress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning you have to shake your own old rags about your body again,\nfor we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has only one. When Ulysses\u2019 son comes home\nagain he will give you both cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.\u201d\nWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some goatskins and sheepskins on the ground in\nfront of the fire. Here Ulysses lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he kept for a\nchange in case of extraordinarily bad weather.\nThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the swineherd did not like sleeping away\nfrom his pigs, so he got ready to go and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his property during his master\u2019s\nabsence. First he slung his sword over his brawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also\ntook the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went\nto his rest where the pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from the North wind.\nBook XV\nBUT Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses\u2019 son that he was to return at once. She found\nhim and Pisistratus sleeping in the forecourt of Menelaus\u2019s house; Pisistratus was fast asleep, but Telemachus could\nget no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy father, so Minerva went close up to him and said:\n\u201cTelemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer, nor leave your property with such\ndangerous people in your house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a\nfool\u2019s errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if you wish to find your excellent mother still there when you\nget back. Her father and brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus, who has given her more than any\nof the others, and has been greatly increasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have been taken\nfrom the house in spite of you, but you know what women are\u2014they always want to do the best they can for the\nman who marries them, and never give another thought to the children of their first husband, nor to their father\neither when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectable\nwoman servant that you have, until it shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of an-\nother matter which you had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors are lying in wait for you in the Strait\nbetween Ithaca and Samos, and they mean to kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they will\nsucceed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up your property will find a grave themselves. Sail\nnight and day, and keep your ship well away from the islands; the god who watches over you and protects you will\nsend you a fair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship and men on to the town, but yourself go straight\nto the swineherd who has charge your pigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the night,\nand then send him to Penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from Pylos.\u201d\nThen she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus with his heel to rouse him, and said, \u201cWake\nup Pisistratus, and yoke the horses to the chariot, for we must set off home.\u201d\nBut Pisistratus said, \u201cNo matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive in the dark. It will be morning soon; wait\ntill Menelaus has brought his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good-bye to us in the usu-\nal way. So long as he lives a guest should never forget a host who has shown him kindness.\u201d\n298 The Odyssey\nAs he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen, leaving Helen in bed, came towards\nthem. When Telemachus saw him he put on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his shoulders, and\nwent out to meet him. \u201cMenelaus,\u201d said he, \u201clet me go back now to my own country, for I want to get home.\u201d\nAnd Menelaus answered, \u201cTelemachus, if you insist on going I will not detain you. not like to see a host either\ntoo fond of his guest or too rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a man go when he wants to\ndo so is as bad as telling him to go if he would like to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is in the house\nand speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then, till I can get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till\nyou have yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient dinner for you of what there may be in\nthe house; it will be at once more proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out on such a long\njourney. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses,\nand will conduct you myself through all our principal cities. No one will send us away empty handed; every one will\ngive us something\u2014a bronze tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup.\u201d\n\u201cMenelaus,\u201d replied Telemachus, \u201cI want to go home at once, for when I came away I left my property without\nprotection, and fear that while looking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that something valuable\nhas been stolen during my absence.\u201d\nWhen Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants to prepare a sufficient dinner from what\nthere might be in the house. At this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got up; so\nMenelaus told him to light the fire and cook some meat, which he at once did. Then Menelaus went down into\nhis fragrant store room, not alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When he reached the place where the\ntreasures of his house were kept, he selected a double cup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also a silver mix-\ning-bowl. Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely dresses which she had made with her own\nhands, and took out one that was largest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a star, and\nlay at the very bottom of the chest. Then they all came back through the house again till they got to Telemachus,\nand Menelaus said, \u201cTelemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring you safely home according to your\ndesire. I will now present you with the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing-bowl of\npure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold, and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians\nmade me a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on my return home. I should like to give\nit to you.\u201d\nWith these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus, while Megapenthes brought the beauti-\nful mixing-bowl and set it before him. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.\n\u201cI too, my son,\u201d said she, \u201chave something for you as a keepsake from the hand of Helen; it is for your bride to\nwear upon her wedding day. Till then, get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go back rejoicing to\nyour own country and to your home.\u201d\nSo saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly. Then Pisistratus put the presents into the\nchariot, and admired them all as he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus into the house, and\nthey both of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it\ninto a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them; an upper servant brought\nthem bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house. Eteoneus carved the meat and gave\nthem each their portions, while Megapenthes poured out the wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things\nthat were before them, but as soon as they had had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus and Pisistratus yoked\nthe horses, and took their places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing\ngatehouse of the outer court, and Menelaus came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they\nmight make a drink-offering before they set out. He stood in front of the horses and pledged them, saying, \u201cFare-\nwell to both of you; see that you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind to me as any father could be\nwhile we Achaeans were fighting before Troy.\u201d\n\u201cWe will be sure, sir,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201cto tell him everything as soon as we see him. I wish I were as cer-\ntain of finding Ulysses returned when I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very great kindness you have\nshown me and of the many beautiful presents I am taking with me.\u201d\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand\u2014an eagle with a great white goose in its talons which it\nhad carried off from the farm yard\u2014and all the men and women were running after it and shouting. It came quite\nclose up to them and flew away on their right hands in front of the horses. When they saw it they were glad, and\ntheir hearts took comfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said, \u201cTell me, Menelaus, has heaven sent this omen for\nus or for you?\u201d\nMenelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to make, but Helen was too quick for\nhim and said, \u201cI will read this matter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it will come to pass.\nThe eagle came from the mountain where it was bred and has its nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having trav-\nelled far and suffered much, will return to take his revenge\u2014if indeed he is not back already and hatching mischief\n299 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nfor the suitors.\u201d\n\u201cMay Jove so grant it,\u201d replied Telemachus; \u201cif it should prove to be so, I will make vows to you as though you\nwere a god, even when I am at home.\u201d\nAs he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed through the town towards the open country.\nThey swayed the yoke upon their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and darkness was over all\nthe land. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles lived who was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus. There they\npassed the night and were treated hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again\nyoked their horses and their places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing\ngatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long\nthey came to Pylos, and then Telemachus said:\n\u201cPisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask you. You know our fathers were old friends\nbefore us; moreover, we are both of an age, and this journey has brought us together still more closely; do not,\ntherefore, take me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I go to your father\u2019s house he will try to keep me in the\nwarmth of his good will towards me, and I must go home at once.\u201d\nPisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end he deemed it best to turn his horses\ntowards the ship, and put Menelaus\u2019s beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then he said,\n\u201cGo on board at once and tell your men to do so also before I can reach home to tell my father. I know how obsti-\nnate he is, and am sure he will not let you go; he will come down here to fetch you, and he will not go back without\nyou. But he will be very angry.\u201d\nWith this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians and soon reached his home, but Telemachus\ncalled the men together and gave his orders. \u201cNow, my men,\u201d said he, \u201cget everything in order on board the ship,\nand let us set out home.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But as Telemachus was thus busied, praying\nalso and sacrificing to Minerva in the ship\u2019s stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, a seer, who was\nflying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was descended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the\nland of sheep; he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into exile by the great and powerful king\nNeleus. Neleus seized his goods and held them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the house\nof king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on account of the daughter of Neleus and because he was\nhaunted by a great sorrow that dread Erinyes had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped with his life, drove\nthe cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avenged the wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to his\nbrother. Then he left the country and went to Argos, where it was ordained that he should reign over much people.\nThere he married, established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates and Mantius. Antiphates became father\nof Oicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus, who was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not live to old\nage, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman\u2019s gifts. His sons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius,\nthe other son of Melampus, was father to Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off Cleitus for\nhis beauty\u2019s sake, that he might dwell among the immortals, but Apollo made Polypheides the greatest seer in the\nwhole world now that Amphiaraus was dead. He quarrelled with his father and went to live in Hyperesia, where he\nremained and prophesied for all men.\nHis son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he was making drink-offerings and praying\nin his ship. \u201cFriend\u2019\u201d said he, \u201cnow that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your sacrifices them-\nselves, and by the god to whom you make them, I pray you also by your own head and by those of your followers,\ntell me the truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell me also of your town and parents.\u201d\nTelemachus said, \u201cI will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and my father is \u2018Ulysses, as surely as that he\never lived. But he has come to some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew together to see\nif I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a long time.\u201d\n\u201cI too,\u201d answered Theoclymenus, am an exile, for I have killed a man of my own race. He has many brothers and\nkinsmen in Argos, and they have great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death at their hands, and am\nthus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the earth. I am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship\nthat they may not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit.\u201d\n\u201cI will not refuse you,\u201d replied Telemachus, \u201cif you wish to join us. Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat\nyou hospitably according to what we have.\u201d\nOn this he received Theoclymenus\u2019 spear and laid it down on the deck of the ship. He went on board and sat\nin the stern, bidding Theoclymenus sit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemachus told them to catch\nhold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so. They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and\nmade it fast with the forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with sheets of twisted ox hide. Minerva sent them\na fair wind that blew fresh and strong to take the ship on her course as fast as possible. Thus then they passed by\nCrouni and Chalcis.\n300 The Odyssey\nPresently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel made a quick pass sage to Pheae and thence\non to Elis, where the Epeans rule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands, wondering within himself\nwhether he should escape death or should be taken prisoner.\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in the hut, and the men supped with them. As\nsoon as they had had to eat and drink, Ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether he would con-\ntinue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the station or pack him off to the city; so he said:\n\u201cEumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and begin begging about the town, so as to be no more\ntrouble to you or to your men. Give me your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide to go with me and show\nme the way. I will go the round of the city begging as I needs must, to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece\nof bread. I should like also to go to the house of Ulysses and bring news of her husband to queen Penelope. I could\nthen go about among the suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should soon make\nthem an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and believe when I tell you that by the blessing of Mercury who\ngives grace and good name to the works of all men, there is no one living who would make a more handy servant\nthan I should\u2014to put fresh wood on the fire, chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and do all those services that\npoor men have to do for their betters.\u201d\nThe swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. \u201cHeaven help me,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cwhat ever can\nhave put such a notion as that into your head? If you go near the suitors you will be undone to a certainty, for their\npride and insolence reach the very heavens. They would never think of taking a man like you for a servant. Their\nservants are all young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and shirts, with well looking faces and their hair\nalways tidy, the tables are kept quite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay where you are, then;\nyou are not in anybody\u2019s way; I do not mind your being here, no more do any of the others, and when Telemachus\ncomes home he will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you want to go.\u201d\nUlysses answered, \u201cI hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are to me, for having saved me from going\nabout and getting into trouble; there is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp; still, when men have\nonce got low down in the world they will go through a great deal on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since howev-\ner you press me to stay here and await the return of Telemachus, tell about Ulysses\u2019 mother, and his father whom\nhe left on the threshold of old age when he set out for Troy. Are they still living or are they already dead and in the\nhouse of Hades?\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you all about them,\u201d replied Eumaeus, \u201cLaertes is still living and prays heaven to let him depart\npeacefully his own house, for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also about the death of his\nwife, which grieved him greatly and aged him more than anything else did. She came to an unhappy end through\nsorrow for her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me come to such an end as she did. As long\nas she was still living, though she was always grieving, I used to like seeing her and asking her how she did, for she\nbrought me up along with her daughter Ctimene, the youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together, and\nshe made little difference between us. When, however, we both grew up, they sent Ctimene to Same and received\na splendid dowry for her. As for me, my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of sandals for my feet,\nand sent me off into the country, but she was just as fond of me as ever. This is all over now. Still it has pleased heav-\nen to prosper my work in the situation which I now hold. I have enough to eat and drink, and can find something\nfor any respectable stranger who comes here; but there is no getting a kind word or deed out of my mistress, for\nthe house has fallen into the hands of wicked people. Servants want sometimes to see their mistress and have a talk\nwith her; they like to have something to eat and drink at the house, and something too to take back with them into\nthe country. This is what will keep servants in a good humour.\u201d\nUlysses answered, \u201cThen you must have been a very little fellow, Eumaeus, when you were taken so far away\nfrom your home and parents. Tell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother lived sacked\nand pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you were alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and\nsell you for whatever your master gave them?\u201d\n\u201cStranger,\u201d replied Eumaeus, \u201cas regards your question: sit still, make yourself comfortable, drink your wine,\nand listen to me. The nights are now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and sitting up talking\ntogether; you ought not to go to bed till bed time, too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one of the others\nwishes to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can then take my master\u2019s pigs out when he has done breakfast in\nthe morning. We two will sit here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling one another stories about our misfor-\ntunes; for when a man has suffered much, and been buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in recalling the\nmemory of sorrows that have long gone by. As regards your question, then, my tale is as follows:\n\u201cYou may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above Ortygia, where the land begins to turn round\nand look in another direction. It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good, with much pasture fit for cattle and\nsheep, and it abounds with wine and wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by any sickness,\nbut when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them with his painless shafts. It contains two communi-\n301 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nties, and the whole country is divided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus, a man comparable to\nthe gods, reigned over both.\n\u201cNow to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia (for the Phoenicians are great mariners)\nin a ship which they had freighted with gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in my\nfather\u2019s house, very tall and comely, and an excellent servant; these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was\nwashing near their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman can resist, no matter how good she\nmay be by nature. The man who had seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on this she\ntold him her father\u2019s name. \u2018I come from Sidon,\u2019 said she, \u2018and am daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One\nday as I was coming into the town from the country some Taphian pirates seized me and took me here over the sea,\nwhere they sold me to the man who owns this house, and he gave them their price for me.\u2019\n\u201cThe man who had seduced her then said, \u2018Would you like to come along with us to see the house of your par-\nents and your parents themselves? They are both alive and are said to be well off.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019I will do so gladly,\u2019 answered she, \u2018if you men will first swear me a solemn oath that you will do me no harm\nby the way.\u2019\n\u201cThey all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their oath the woman said, \u2018Hush; and if any\nof your men meets me in the street or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one should go and\ntell my master, in which case he would suspect something. He would put me in prison, and would have all of you\nmurdered; keep your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can, and send me word when you\nhave done loading. I will bring as much gold as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else also that I can\ndo towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good man of the house, a funny little fellow just able to run\nabout. I will carry him off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of money for him if you take him and sell him\nin foreign parts.\u2019\n\u201cOn this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole year till they had loaded their ship with\nmuch precious merchandise, and then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the woman. Their\nmessenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father\u2019s house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung\namong it; and while my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring it and bargaining about it, he made\na sign quietly to the woman and then went back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of\nthe house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with the cups of guests who had been feasting with my\nfather, as being in attendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the public assembly, so she snatched\nup three cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress, while I followed her, for I knew no better. The sun\nwas now set, and darkness was over all the land, so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour,\nwhere the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on board they sailed their ways over the sea, taking us\nwith them, and Jove sent then a fair wind; six days did we sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana\nstruck the woman and she fell heavily down into the ship\u2019s hold as though she were a sea gull alighting on the water;\nso they threw her overboard to the seals and fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds and\nwaves took the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to\nset eyes upon this country.\u201d\nUlysses answered, \u201cEumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes with the most lively interest and pity,\nbut Jove has given you good as well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master, who sees that you\nalways have enough to eat and drink; and you lead a good life, whereas I am still going about begging my way from\ncity to city.\u201d\nThus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left for sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the\nmeantime Telemachus and his crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the mast, and rowed the\nship into the harbour. They cast out their mooring stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the\nsea shore, mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus\nsaid, \u201cTake the ship on to the town, but leave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms. In\nthe evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to the city, and to-morrow morning in return for your\ntrouble I will give you all a good dinner with meat and wine.\u201d\nThen Theoclymenus said, \u2018And what, my dear young friend, is to become of me? To whose house, among all\nyour chief men, am I to repair? or shall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?\u201d\n\u201cAt any other time,\u201d replied Telemachus, \u201cI should have bidden you go to my own house, for you would find no\nwant of hospitality; at the present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for I shall be away, and\nmy mother will not see you; she does not often show herself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an\nupper chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can go to\u2014I mean Eurymachus the son\nof Polybus, who is held in the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and the most\npersistent wooer, of all those who are paying court to my mother and trying to take Ulysses\u2019 place. Jove, however, in\nheaven alone knows whether or no they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes place.\u201d\n302 The Odyssey\nAs he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand \u2014 a hawk, Apollo\u2019s messenger. It held a dove in its talons,\nand the feathers, as it tore them off, fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the ship. On this Theo-\nclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand. \u201cTelemachus,\u201d said he, \u201cthat bird did not fly on your right\nhand without having been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew it was an omen; it means that you will\nremain powerful and that there will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.\u201d\n\u201cI wish it may prove so,\u201d answered Telemachus. \u201cIf it does, I will show you so much good will and give you so\nmany presents that all who meet you will congratulate you.\u201d\nThen he said to his friend Piraeus, \u201cPiraeus, son of Clytius, you have throughout shown yourself the most\nwilling to serve me of all those who have accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this stranger to your own\nhouse and entertain him hospitably till I can come for him.\u201d\nAnd Piraeus answered, \u201cTelemachus, you may stay away as long as you please, but I will look after him for you,\nand he shall find no lack of hospitality.\u201d\nAs he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and loose the hawsers, so they took their places\nin the ship. But Telemachus bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head of sharpened\nbronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards\nthe city as they had been told to do, while Telemachus strode on as fast as he could, till he reached the homestead\nwhere his countless herds of swine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, who was so devoted a\nservant to his master.\nBook XVI\nMEANWHILE Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were were getting breakfast ready at day-\nbreak for they had sent the men out with the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark, but fawned\nupon him, so Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet and noticing that the dogs did not bark, said to Eumaeus:\n\u201cEumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of your acquaintance is coming here, for\nthe dogs are fawning urn him and not barking.\u201d\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the door. Eumaeus sprang to his feet, and the\nbowls in which he was mixing wine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed his head and both\nhis beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not be more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of\nhis old age, after ten years\u2019 absence in a foreign country and after having gone through much hardship. He em-\nbraced him, kissed him all over as though he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:\n\u201cSo you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When I heard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I\nwas never going to see you any more. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good look at you now\nyou are home again; it is not very often you come into the country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the\ntown generally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the suitors are doing.\u201d\n\u201cSo be it, old friend,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201cbut I am come now because I want to see you, and to learn wheth-\ner my mother is still at her old home or whether some one else has married her, so that the bed of Ulysses is without\nbedding and covered with cobwebs.\u201d\n\u201cShe is still at the house,\u201d replied Eumaeus, \u201cgrieving and breaking her heart, and doing nothing but weep, both\nnight and day continually.\u201d\nAs spoke he took Telemachus\u2019 spear, whereon he crossed the stone threshold and came inside. Ulysses rose\nfrom his seat to give him place as he entered, but Telemachus checked him; \u201cSit down, stranger.\u201d said he, \u201cI can easi-\nly find another seat, and there is one here who will lay it for me.\u201d\nUlysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green brushwood on the floor and threw a\nsheepskin on top of it for Telemachus to sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of cold meat, the\nremains from what they had eaten the day before, and he filled the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He\nmixed wine also in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they laid their hands on the good\nthings that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus,\n\u201cOld friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crew bring him to Ithaca, and who were they?-for\nassuredly he did not come here by land\u201d\u2019\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \u201cMy son, I will tell you the real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and\nthat he has been a great traveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship, and has refuge at my\nstation, so I will put him into your hands. Do whatever you like with him, only remember that he is your suppliant.\u201d\n\u201cI am very much distressed,\u201d said Telemachus, \u201cby what you have just told me. How can I take this stranger into\nmy house? I am as yet young, and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My mother cannot\nmake up her mind whether to stay where she is and look after the house out of respect for public opinion and the\nmemory of her husband, or whether the time is now come for her to take the best man of those who are wooing\n303 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nher, and the one who will make her the most advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come to your station I will\nfind him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals, and will send him wherever he wants to go. Or\nif you like you can keep him here at the station, and I will send him clothes and food that he may be no burden on\nyou and on your men; but I will not have him go near the suitors, for they are very insolent, and are sure to ill-treat\nhim in a way that would greatly grieve me; no matter how valiant a man may be he can do nothing against num-\nbers, for they will be too strong for him.\u201d\nThen Ulysses said, \u201cSir, it is right that I should say something myself. I am much shocked about what you have\nsaid about the insolent way in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you are. Tell me, do you\nsubmit to such treatment tamely, or has some god set your people against you? May you not complain of your\nbrothers\u2014for it is to these that a man may look for support, however great his quarrel may be? I wish I were as\nyoung as you are and in my present mind; if I were son to Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would rather some\none came and cut my head off, but I would go to the house and be the bane of every one of these men. If they were\ntoo many for me\u2014I being single-handed\u2014I would rather die fighting in my own house than see such disgraceful\nsights day after day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an un-\nseemly way, wine drawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that shall never be accomplished.\u201d\nAnd Telemachus answered, \u201cI will tell you truly everything. There is no emnity between me and my people,\nnor can I complain of brothers, to whom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove has\nmade us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius, and Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the\nonly son of Ulysses who left me behind him when he went away, so that I have never been of any use to him. Hence\nit comes that my house is in the hands of numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring islands,\nDulichium, Same, Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext\nof paying court to my mother, who will neither say point blank that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to\nan end, so they are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so with myself into the bargain. The issue,\nhowever, rests with heaven. But do you, old friend Eumaeus, go at once and tell Penelope that I am safe and have\nreturned from Pylos. Tell it to herself alone, and then come back here without letting any one else know, for there\nare many who are plotting mischief against me.\u201d\n\u201cI understand and heed you,\u201d replied Eumaeus; \u201cyou need instruct me no further, only I am going that way say\nwhether I had not better let poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend the work on his farm\nin spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses, and he would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they tell\nme that from the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither eaten nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he\nlook after his farm, but sits weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.\u201d\n\u201cMore\u2019s the pity,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201cI am sorry for him, but we must leave him to himself just now. If peo-\nple could have everything their own way, the first thing I should choose would be the return of my father; but go,\nand give your message; then make haste back again, and do not turn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother\nto send one of her women secretly with the news at once, and let him hear it from her.\u201d\nThus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals, bound them to his feet, and started for\nthe town. Minerva watched him well off the station, and then came up to it in the form of a woman\u2014fair, stately,\nand wise. She stood against the side of the entry, and revealed herself to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see her,\nand knew not that she was there, for the gods do not let themselves be seen by everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so\ndid the dogs, for they did not bark, but went scared and whining off to the other side of the yards. She nodded her\nhead and motioned to Ulysses with her eyebrows; whereon he left the hut and stood before her outside the main\nwall of the yards. Then she said to him:\n\u201cUlysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell your son: do not keep him in the dark any longer,\nbut lay your plans for the destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will not be long in joining you,\nfor I too am eager for the fray.\u201d\nAs she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw a fair clean shirt and cloak about his\nshoulders; then she made him younger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour, filled out his\ncheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she went away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was\nastounded when he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking upon a god.\n\u201cStranger,\u201d said he, \u201chow suddenly you have changed from what you were a moment or two ago. You are\ndressed differently and your colour is not the same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? If so,\nbe propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.\u201d\nAnd Ulysses said, \u201cI am no god, why should you take me for one? I am your father, on whose account you\ngrieve and suffer so much at the hands of lawless men.\u201d\nAs he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on to the ground, for he had restrained all tears till\nnow. but Telemachus could not yet believe that it was his father, and said:\n\u201cYou are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes that I may grieve the more hereafter; no\n304 The Odyssey\nmortal man could of himself contrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young at a moment\u2019s\nnotice, unless a god were with him. A second ago you were old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come\ndown from heaven.\u201d\nUlysses answered, \u201cTelemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably astonished at my being really here. There\nis no other Ulysses who will come hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering and much hardship have\ngot home in the twentieth year to my own country. What you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess\nMinerva, who does with me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. At one moment she makes me like\na beggar, and the next I am a young man with good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who live in\nheaven to make any man look either rich or poor.\u201d\nAs he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his father and wept. They were both so much\nmoved that they cried aloud like eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their half fledged\nyoung by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if\nTelemachus had not suddenly said, \u201cIn what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you to Ithaca? Of what nation\ndid they declare themselves to be\u2014for you cannot have come by land?\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you the truth, my son,\u201d replied Ulysses. \u201cIt was the Phaeacians who brought me here. They are great\nsailors, and are in the habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They took me over the sea while I\nwas fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca, after giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These things\nby heaven\u2019s mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now come here on the suggestion of Minerva that we may\nconsult about killing our enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with their number, that I may learn\nwho, and how many, they are. I can then turn the matter over in my mind, and see whether we two can fight the\nwhole body of them ourselves, or whether we must find others to help us.\u201d\nTo this Telemachus answered, \u201cFather, I have always heard of your renown both in the field and in council, but\nthe task you talk of is a very great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot stand against many\nand brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor twice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number\nat once. There are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium, and they have six servants; from Same there are twen-\nty-four; twenty young Achaeans from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them well born. They have\nwith them a servant Medon, a bard, and two men who can carve at table. If we face such numbers as this, you may\nhave bitter cause to rue your coming, and your revenge. See whether you cannot think of some one who would be\nwilling to come and help us.\u201d\n\u201cListen to me,\u201d replied Ulysses, \u201cand think whether Minerva and her father Jove may seem sufficient, or wheth-\ner I am to try and find some one else as well.\u201d\n\u201cThose whom you have named,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201care a couple of good allies, for though they dwell high\nup among the clouds they have power over both gods and men.\u201d\n\u201cThese two,\u201d continued Ulysses, \u201cwill not keep long out of the fray, when the suitors and we join fight in my\nhouse. Now, therefore, return home early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as before. Later on\nthe swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a miserable old beggar. If you see them ill-treating me, steel\nyour heart against my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of the house, or throw things at me,\nlook on and do nothing beyond gently trying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to you,\nfor the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, when Minerva shall\nput it in my mind, I will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect all the armour that is in\nthe house and hide it in the strong store room. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing\nit; say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses\nwent away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you are afraid Jove\nmay set them on to quarrel over their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both\nbanquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them. But leave a sword and a spear\napiece for yourself and me, and a couple oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; Jove and\nMinerva will then soon quiet these people. There is also another matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood\nruns in your veins, let no one know that Ulysses is within the house\u2014neither Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor\nany of the servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let you and me exploit the women alone, and let us also make trial\nof some other of the men servants, to see who is on our side and whose hand is against us.\u201d\n\u201cFather,\u201d replied Telemachus, \u201cyou will come to know me by and by, and when you do you will find that I can\nkeep your counsel. I do not think, however, the plan you propose will turn out well for either of us. Think it over. It\nwill take us a long time to go the round of the farms and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be wasting\nyour estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the women by all means, to see who are disloyal and\nwho guiltless, but I am not in favour of going round and trying the men. We can attend to that later on, if you really\nhave some sign from Jove that he will support you.\u201d\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought Telemachus and his crew from Pylos had\n305 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nreached the town of Ithaca. When they had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the land; their ser-\nvants came and took their armour from them, and they left all the presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a\nservant to tell Penelope that Telemachus had gone into the country, but had sent the ship to the town to prevent her\nfrom being alarmed and made unhappy. This servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when they were both on the\nsame errand of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House, the servant stood up and said to the queen in\nthe presence of the waiting women, \u201cYour son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos\u201d; but Eumaeus went close up to\nPenelope, and said privately that her son had given bidden him tell her. When he had given his message he left the\nhouse with its outbuildings and went back to his pigs again.\nThe suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they went outside the great wall that ran round\nthe outer court, and held a council near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the first to speak.\n\u201cMy friends,\u201d said he, \u201cthis voyage of Telemachus\u2019s is a very serious matter; we had made sure that it would\ncome to nothing. Now, however, let us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to send after the others\nand tell them to come back as fast as they can.\u201d\nHe had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and saw the ship inside the harbour, with\nthe crew lowering her sails, and putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others, \u201cWe need not send\nthem any message, for they are here. Some god must have told them, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not\novertake her.\nOn this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the ship on shore; their servants took their ar-\nmour from them, and they went up in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let any one old or young\nsit along with them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke first.\n\u201cGood heavens,\u201d said he, \u201csee how the gods have saved this man from destruction. We kept a succession of\nscouts upon the headlands all day long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep, but waited\nin the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and killing him; but some god has conveyed him home\nin spite of us. Let us consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape us; our affair is never likely to\ncome off while is alive, for he is very shrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on our side. We must make haste\nbefore he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he will lose no time in doing so, for he will be furious with us, and will\ntell all the world how we plotted to kill him, but failed to take him. The people will not like this when they come\nto know of it; we must see that they do us no hurt, nor drive us from our own country into exile. Let us try and\nlay hold of him either on his farm away from the town, or on the road hither. Then we can divide up his property\namongst us, and let his mother and the man who marries her have the house. If this does not please you, and you\nwish Telemachus to live on and hold his father\u2019s property, then we must not gather here and eat up his goods in this\nway, but must make our offers to Penelope each from his own house, and she can marry the man who will give the\nmost for her, and whose lot it is to win her.\u201d\nThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the son of Nisus, who was son to king\nAretias, and he was foremost among all the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of Dulichium;\nhis conversation, moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope than that of any of the other for he was a man of good\nnatural disposition. \u201cMy friends,\u201d said he, speaking to them plainly and in all honestly, \u201cI am not in favour of killing\nTelemachus. It is a heinous thing to kill one who is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of the gods, and if the\noracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to kill him myself, and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade\nus, I would have you hold your hands.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose forthwith and went to the house of Ulysses\nwhere they took their accustomed seats.\nThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors. She knew of the plot against Telemachus, for\nthe servant Medon had overheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to the court attended\nby her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the\ncloister holding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:\n\u201cAntinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best speaker and counsellor of any man your own\nage in Ithaca, but you are nothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the death of Telemachus,\nand take no heed of suppliants, whose witness is Jove himself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one anoth-\ner. Do you not remember how your father fled to this house in fear of the people, who were enraged against him for\nhaving gone with some Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us? They wanted to\ntear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses stayed their hands although they were infuriated, and\nnow you devour his property without paying for it, and break my heart by his wooing his wife and trying to kill his\nson. Leave off doing so, and stop the others also.\u201d\nTo this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, \u201cTake heart, Queen Penelope daughter of Icarius, and do not\ntrouble yourself about these matters. The man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon your son\nTelemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth. I say\u2014and it shall surely be\u2014that my spear shall be\n306 The Odyssey\nreddened with his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees, held wine up to my lips to drink, and\nput pieces of meat into my hands. Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing to fear\nfrom the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to him from the gods, he cannot escape it.\u201d He said this to\nquiet her, but in reality he was plotting against Telemachus.\nThen Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva shed sleep over her eyes. In the\nevening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses and his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were ready;\nhelping one another to get supper ready; Minerva therefore came up to Ulysses, turned him into an old man with a\nstroke of her wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd might recognize him and not\nkeep the secret, but go and tell Penelope.\nTelemachus was the first to speak. \u201cSo you have got back, Eumaeus,\u201d said he. \u201cWhat is the news of the town?\nHave the suitors returned, or are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?\u201d\n\u201cI did not think of asking about that,\u201d replied Eumaeus, \u201cwhen I was in the town. I thought I would give my\nmessage and come back as soon as I could. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos, and he was\nthe first to tell the new your mother, but I can say what I saw with my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of\nthe hill of Mercury above the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour with a number of men in her. They had\nmany shields and spears, and I thought it was the suitors, but I cannot be sure.\u201d\nOn hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus could not see him.\nThen, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share\nso that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest and enjoyed the\nboon of sleep.\nBook XVII\nWHEN the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus bound on his sandals and took a\nstrong spear that suited his hands, for he wanted to go into the city. \u201cOld friend,\u201d said he to the swineherd, \u201cI will\nnow go to the town and show myself to my mother, for she will never leave off grieving till she has seen me. As for\nthis unfortunate stranger, take him to the town and let him beg there of any one who will give him a drink and a\npiece of bread. I have trouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened with other people. If this makes him\nangry so much the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean.\u201d\nThen Ulysses said, \u201cSir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can always do better in town than country, for any\none who likes can give him something. I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck and call of a master.\nTherefore let this man do as you have just told him, and take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the\nfire, and the day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished\nwith cold, for you say the city is some way off.\u201d\nOn this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge upon the When he reached home he\nstood his spear against a bearing-post of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister itself, and went inside.\nNurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting the fleeces on to the seats, and she burst\nout crying as she ran up to him; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and shoulders with their\nkisses. Penelope came out of her room looking like Diana or Venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son.\nShe kissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes, \u201cLight of my eyes,\u201d she cried as she spoke fondly to him, \u201cso you\nare come home again; I made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think of your having gone off to Pylos\nwithout saying anything about it or obtaining my consent. But come, tell me what you saw.\u201d\n\u201cDo not scold me, mother,\u2019 answered Telemachus, \u201cnor vex me, seeing what a narrow escape I have had, but\nwash your face, change your dress, go upstairs with your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs to all\nthe gods if Jove will only grant us our revenge upon the suitors. I must now go to the place of assembly to invite a\nstranger who has come back with me from Pylos. I sent him on with my crew, and told Piraeus to take him home\nand look after him till I could come for him myself.\u201d\nShe heeded her son\u2019s words, washed her face, changed her dress, and vowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all\nthe gods if they would only vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors.\nTelemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand\u2014not alone, for his two fleet dogs went with\nhim. Minerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went by, and\nthe suitors gathered round him with fair words in their mouths and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and\nwent to sit with Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of his father\u2019s house, and they made him tell them\nall that had happened to him. Then Piraeus came up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted through the town\nto the place of assembly, whereon Telemachus at once joined them. Piraeus was first to speak: \u201cTelemachus,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cI wish you would send some of your women to my house to take awa the presents Menelaus gave you.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not know, Piraeus,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201cwhat may happen. If the suitors kill me in my own house\n307 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nand divide my property among them, I would rather you had the presents than that any of those people should get\nhold of them. If on the other hand I manage to kill them, I shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my\npresents.\u201d\nWith these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they got there they laid their cloaks on the\nbenches and seats, went into the baths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed them,\nand had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats at table. A maid servant then brought them water in a\nbeautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a clean table\nbeside them. An upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the\nhouse. Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the bearing-posts of the cloister, and spinning.\nThen they laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough to eat\nand drink Penelope said:\n\u201cTelemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which I have not ceased to water with my tears,\nfrom the day Ulysses set out for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make it clear to me before the\nsuitors came back to the house, whether or no you had been able to hear anything about the return of your father.\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you then truth,\u201d replied her son. \u201cWe went to Pylos and saw Nestor, who took me to his house and\ntreated me as hospitably as though I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long absence; so also did\nhis sons; but he said he had not heard a word from any human being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead.\nHe sent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There I saw Helen, for whose sake so many, both\nArgives and Trojans, were in heaven\u2019s wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was that had brought\nme to Lacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth, whereon he said, \u2018So, then, these cowards would usurp a brave\nman\u2019s bed? A hind might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the forest\nor in some grassy dell. The lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short work with the pair of them, and so\nwill Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he\nwrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Greeks cheered him\u2014if he is still such,\nand were to come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your question,\nhowever, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the old man of the sea told me, so much will I tell you in\nfull. He said he could see Ulysses on an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who was keep-\ning him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea.\u2019 This\nwas what Menelaus told me, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then gave me a fair wind and\nsoon brought me safe home again.\u201d\nWith these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus said to her:\n\u201cMadam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these things; listen therefore to me, for I can divine\nthem surely, and will hide nothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness, and the rites of hospitality,\nwith that hearth of Ulysses to which I now come, that Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either going about\nthe country or staying in one place, is enquiring into all these evil deeds and preparing a day of reckoning for the\nsuitors. I saw an omen when I was on the ship which meant this, and I told Telemachus about it.\u201d\n\u201cMay it be even so,\u201d answered Penelope; \u201cif your words come true, you shall have such gifts and such good will\nfrom me that all who see you shall congratulate you.\u201d\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs, or aiming with spears at a mark on the lev-\nelled ground in front of the house, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it was now time for dinner,\nand the flock of sheep and goats had come into the town from all the country round, with their shepherds as usual,\nthen Medon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited upon them at table, said, \u201cNow then, my young mas-\nters, you have had enough sport, so come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is not a bad thing, at dinner\ntime.\u201d\nThey left their sports as he told them, and when they were within the house, they laid their cloaks on the bench-\nes and seats inside, and then sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat and well grown. Thus\nthey made ready for their meal. In the meantime Ulysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and\nthe swineherd said, \u201cStranger, I suppose you still want to go to town to-day, as my master said you were to do; for\nmy own part I should have liked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must do as my master tells me, or he will\nscold me later on, and a scolding from one\u2019s master is a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for it is now broad\nday; it will be night again directly and then you will find it colder.\u201d\n\u201cI know, and understand you,\u201d replied Ulysses; \u201cyou need say no more. Let us be going, but if you have a stick\nready cut, let me have it to walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one.\u201d\nAs he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders, by the cord from which it hung, and\nEumaeus gave him a stick to his liking. The two then started, leaving the station in charge of the dogs and herdsmen\nwho remained behind; the swineherd led the way and his master followed after, looking like some broken-down old\ntramp as he leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in rags. When they had got over the rough steep ground\n308 The Odyssey\nand were nearing the city, they reached the fountain from which the citizens drew their water. This had been made\nby Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There was a grove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it, and the\nclear cold water came down to it from a rock high up, while above the fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at\nwhich all wayfarers used to sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook them as he was driving down some\ngoats, the best in his flock, for the suitors\u2019 dinner, and there were two shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaeus\nand Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language, which made Ulysses very angry.\n\u201cThere you go,\u201d cried he, \u201cand a precious pair you are. See how heaven brings birds of the same feather to one\nanother. Where, pray, master swineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It would make any one sick to\nsee such a creature at table. A fellow like this never won a prize for anything in his life, but will go about rubbing his\nshoulders against every man\u2019s door post, and begging, not for swords and cauldrons like a man, but only for a few\nscraps not worth begging for. If you would give him to me for a hand on my station, he might do to clean out the\nfolds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids, and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but he\nhas taken to bad ways and will not go about any kind of work; he will do nothing but beg victuals all the town over,\nto feed his insatiable belly. I say, therefore and it shall surely be\u2014if he goes near Ulysses\u2019 house he will get his head\nbroken by the stools they will fling at him, till they turn him out.\u201d\nOn this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure wantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did\nnot budge from the path. For a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill him with his staff,\nor fling him to the ground and beat his brains out; he resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check, but\nthe swineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting up his hands and praying to heaven as he did\nso.\n\u201cFountain nymphs,\u201d he cried, \u201cchildren of Jove, if ever Ulysses burned you thigh bones covered with fat whether\nof lambs or kids, grant my prayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an end to the swaggering\nthreats with which such men as you go about insulting people-gadding all over the town while your flocks are going\nto ruin through bad shepherding.\u201d\nThen Melanthius the goatherd answered, \u201cYou ill-conditioned cur, what are you talking about? Some day or\nother I will put you on board ship and take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and pocket the money you\nwill fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo would strike Telemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors would\nkill him, as I am that Ulysses will never come home again.\u201d\nWith this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went quickly forward and soon reached the house\nof his master. When he got there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite Eurymachus, who liked\nhim better than any of the others. The servants brought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set\nbread before him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and the swineherd came up to the house and stood by it, amid\na sound of music, for Phemius was just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold of the swineherd\u2019s\nhand, and said:\n\u201cEumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter how far you go you will find few like it. One\nbuilding keeps following on after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements all round it; the doors are\ndouble folding, and of good workmanship; it would be a hard matter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too, that\nthere are many people banqueting within it, for there is a smell of roast meat, and I hear a sound of music, which\nthe gods have made to go along with feasting.\u201d\nThen Eumaeus said, \u201cYou have perceived aright, as indeed you generally do; but let us think what will be our\nbest course. Will you go inside first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait here and let\nme go in first? But do not wait long, or some one may you loitering about outside, and throw something at you.\nConsider this matter I pray you.\u201d\nAnd Ulysses answered, \u201cI understand and heed. Go in first and leave me here where I am. I am quite used to\nbeing beaten and having things thrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that I am\ncase-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But a man cannot hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this\nis an enemy which gives much trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships are fitted out to sail the seas, and to\nmake war upon other people.\u201d\nAs they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his head and pricked up his ears. This was Ar-\ngos, whom Ulysses had bred before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out of him. In the old days\nhe used to be taken out by the young men when they went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his\nmaster was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in front of the stable doors till\nthe men should come and draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw Ulysses\nstanding there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. When Ulysses\nsaw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaeus seeing it, and said:\n\u201cEumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap: his build is splendid; is he as fine a\nfellow as he looks, or is he only one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept merely for show?\u201d\n309 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u201cThis hound,\u201d answered Eumaeus, \u201cbelonged to him who has died in a far country. If he were what he was when\nUlysses left for Troy, he would soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the forest that could\nget away from him when he was once on its tracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and\ngone, and the women take no care of him. Servants never do their work when their master\u2019s hand is no longer over\nthem, for Jove takes half the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.\u201d\nAs he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the suitors were, but Argos died as soon as he\nhad recognized his master.\nTelemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned him to come and sit beside him; so he\nlooked about and saw a seat lying near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he picked it up,\nbrought it to Telemachus\u2019s table, and sat down opposite him. Then the servant brought him his portion, and gave\nhim bread from the bread-basket.\nImmediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor miserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and\nwith his clothes all in rags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors leading from the\nouter to the inner court, and against a bearing-post of cypress-wood which the carpenter had skillfully planed, and\nhad made to join truly with rule and line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the bread-basket, with as much meat\nas he could hold in his two hands, and said to Eumaeus, \u201cTake this to the stranger, and tell him to go the round of\nthe suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be shamefaced.\u201d\nSo Eumaeus went up to him and said, \u201cStranger, Telemachus sends you this, and says you are to go the round of\nthe suitors begging, for beggars must not be shamefaced.\u201d\nUlysses answered, \u201cMay King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus, and fulfil the desire of his heart.\u201d\nThen with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid it on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He\nwent on eating it while the bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left off. The suitors applauded\nthe bard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses and prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suit-\nors, that he might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good from the bad; but come what might she was\nnot going to save a single one of them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from left to right, and stretched\nout his hands to beg as though he were a real beggar. Some of them pitied him, and were curious about him, asking\none another who he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthius said, \u201cSuitors of my noble mis-\ntress, I can tell you something about him, for I have seen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I know\nnothing about the man himself, nor where he comes from.\u201d\nOn this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. \u201cYou precious idiot,\u201d he cried, \u201cwhat have you brought this\nman to town for? Have we not tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think it\na small thing that such people gather here to waste your master\u2019s property and must you needs bring this man as\nwell?\u201d\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \u201cAntinous, your birth is good but your words evil. It was no doing of mine that he\ncame here. Who is likely to invite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those who can do public\nservice as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a bard who can charm us with his Such men are welcome all the\nworld over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him. You are always harder on Ulysses\u2019 servants\nthan any of the other suitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as Telemachus and Penelope are\nalive and here.\u201d\nBut Telemachus said, \u201cHush, do not answer him; Antinous has the bitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he\nmakes the others worse.\u201d\nThen turning to Antinous he said, \u201cAntinous, you take as much care of my interests as though I were your son.\nWhy should you want to see this stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take\u2019 something and give it him\nyourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind my mother, nor any of the other servants in the house;\nbut I know you will not do what I say, for you are more fond of eating things yourself than of giving them to other\npeople.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Telemachus,\u201d replied Antinous, \u201cby this swaggering talk? If all the suitors were to give him\nas much as I will, he would not come here again for another three months.\u201d\nAs he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from under the table, and made as though he\nwould throw it at Ulysses, but the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet with bread and meat;\nhe was about, therefore, to go back to the threshold and eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to\nAntinous and said:\n\u201cSir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; you seem to be a chief, foremost among\nthem all; therefore you should be the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too was a rich man\nonce, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he\nmight be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things which people have who live\nwell and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving\n310 The Odyssey\nrobbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I stationed my bade ships in the river Aegyptus, and\nbade my men stay by them and keep guard over them, while sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of\nvantage.\n\u201cBut the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing\nthe men, and taking their wives and children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard\nthe war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the\ngleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found\nthemselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for them; as for\nmyself, they gave me to a friend who met them, to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great\nman in Cyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery.\u201d\nThen Antinous said, \u201cWhat god can have sent such a pestilence to plague us during our dinner? Get out, into\nthe open part of the court, or I will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and importunity; you\nhave begged of all the others, and they have given you lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy\nto be free with other people\u2019s property when there is plenty of it.\u201d\nOn this Ulysses began to move off, and said, \u201cYour looks, my fine sir, are better than your breeding; if you were\nin your own house you would not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for though you are in another man\u2019s,\nand surrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you to give him even a piece of bread.\u201d\nThis made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, \u201cYou shall pay for this before you get clear of\nthe court.\u201d With these words he threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the right shoulder-blade near the top of\nhis back. Ulysses stood firm as a rock and the blow did not even stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he\nbrooded on his revenge. Then he went back to the threshold and sat down there, laying his well-filled wallet at his\nfeet.\n\u201cListen to me,\u201d he cried, \u201cyou suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. A man knows\nneither ache nor pain if he gets hit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle; and even so Antinous\nhas hit me while in the service of my miserable belly, which is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the poor\nhave gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous may come to a bad end before his marriage.\u201d\n\u201cSit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off elsewhere,\u201d shouted Antinous. \u201cIf you say more I\nwill have you dragged hand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you alive.\u201d\nThe other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young men said, \u201cAntinous, you did ill in striking\nthat poor wretch of a tramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some god \u2014 and we know the gods\ngo about disguised in all sorts of ways as people from foreign countries, and travel about the world to see who do\namiss and who righteously.\u201d\nThus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile Telemachus was furious about the blow that\nhad been given to his father, and though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence and brooded on his\nrevenge.\nNow when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the banqueting-cloister, she said before her\nmaids, \u201cWould that Apollo would so strike you, Antinous,\u201d and her waiting woman Eurynome answered, \u201cIf our\nprayers were answered not one of the suitors would ever again see the sun rise.\u201d Then Penelope said, \u201cNurse, I hate\nevery single one of them, for they mean nothing but mischief, but I hate Antinous like the darkness of death itself.\nA poor unfortunate tramp has come begging about the house for sheer want. Every one else has given him some-\nthing to put in his wallet, but Antinous has hit him on the right shoulder-blade with a footstool.\u201d\nThus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in the meantime Ulysses was getting his din-\nner. Then she called for the swineherd and said, \u201cEumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here, I want to see him\nand ask him some questions. He seems to have travelled much, and he may have seen or heard something of my\nunhappy husband.\u201d\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \u201cIf these Achaeans, Madam, would only keep quiet, you would be\ncharmed with the history of his adventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut, which was the\nfirst place he reached after running away from his ship, and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If\nhe had been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose lips all hearers hang entranced, I could\nnot have been more charmed as I sat in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an old friendship between his\nhouse and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete where the descendants of Minos live, after having been\ndriven hither and thither by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he has heard of Ulysses as being alive\nand near at hand among the Thesprotians, and that he is bringing great wealth home with him.\u201d\n\u201cCall him here, then,\u201d said Penelope, \u201cthat I too may hear his story. As for the suitors, let them take their plea-\nsure indoors or out as they will, for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine remain unwasted in their\nhouses with none but servants to consume them, while they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing\nour oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine\n311 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthey drink. No estate can stand such recklessness, for we have now no Ulysses to protect us. If he were to come\nagain, he and his son would soon have their revenge.\u201d\nAs she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house resounded with it. Penelope laughed when\nshe heard this, and said to Eumaeus, \u201cGo and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed just as I was\nspeaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are going to be killed, and that not one of them shall escape. Fur-\nthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart: if I am satisfied that the stranger is speaking the truth I shall give\nhim a shirt and cloak of good wear.\u201d\nWhen Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said, \u201cFather stranger, my mistress Penelope, mother\nof Telemachus, has sent for you; she is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her about her hus-\nband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very\nthings that you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough of that to fill your belly, by begging about the\ntown, and letting those give that will.\u201d\n\u201cI will tell Penelope,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201cnothing but what is strictly true. I know all about her husband, and\nhave been partner with him in affliction, but I am afraid of passing. through this crowd of cruel suitors, for their\npride and insolence reach heaven. Just now, moreover, as I was going about the house without doing any harm, a\nman gave me a blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemachus nor any one else defended me. Tell Penelope,\ntherefore, to be patient and wait till sundown. Let her give me a seat close up to the fire, for my clothes are worn\nvery thin \u2014 you know they are, for you have seen them ever since I first asked you to help me \u2014 she can then ask\nme about the return of her husband.\u201d\nThe swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she saw him cross the threshold, \u201cWhy do\nyou not bring him here, Eumaeus? Is he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming inside the\nhouse at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.\u201d\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \u201cThe stranger is quite reasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and\nis only doing what any one else would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be much better, madam, that\nyou should have him all to yourself, when you can hear him and talk to him as you will.\u201d\n\u201cThe man is no fool,\u201d answered Penelope, \u201cit would very likely be as he says, for there are no such abominable\npeople in the whole world as these men are.\u201d\nWhen she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for he had explained everything. Then he went\nup to Telemachus and said in his ear so that none could overhear him, \u201cMy dear sir, I will now go back to the pigs,\nto see after your property and my own business. You will look to what is going on here, but above all be careful to\nkeep out of danger, for there are many who bear you ill will. May Jove bring them to a bad end before they do us a\nmischief.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d replied Telemachus, \u201cgo home when you have had your dinner, and in the morning come here with\nthe victims we are to sacrifice for the day. Leave the rest to heaven and me.\u201d\nOn this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his dinner he left the courts and the cloister\nwith the men at table, and went back to his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began to amuse themselves with\nsinging and dancing, for it was now getting on towards evening.\nBook XVIII\nNOW there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all over the city of Ithaca, and was notori-\nous as an incorrigible glutton and drunkard. This man had no strength nor stay in him, but he was a great hulking\nfellow to look at; his real name, the one his mother gave him, was Arnaeus, but the young men of the place called\nhim Irus, because he used to run errands for any one who would send him. As soon as he came he began to insult\nUlysses, and to try and drive him out of his own house.\n\u201cBe off, old man,\u201d he cried, \u201cfrom the doorway, or you shall be dragged out neck and heels. Do you not see that\nthey are all giving me the wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so? Get up then,\nand go of yourself, or we shall come to blows.\u201d\nUlysses frowned on him and said, \u201cMy friend, I do you no manner of harm; people give you a great deal, but I\nam not jealous. There is room enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge me things that\nare not yours to give. You seem to be just such another tramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck\nby and by. Do not, however, talk too much about fighting or you will incense me, and old though I am, I shall cover\nyour mouth and chest with blood. I shall have more peace to-morrow if I do, for you will not come to the house of\nUlysses any more.\u201d\nIrus was very angry and answered, \u201cYou filthy glutton, you run on trippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good\nmind to lay both hands about you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boar\u2019s tusks. Get ready,\ntherefore, and let these people here stand by and look on. You will never be able to fight one who is so much young-\n312 The Odyssey\ner than yourself.\u201d\nThus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front of the doorway, and when Antinous\nsaw what was going on he laughed heartily and said to the others, \u201cThis is the finest sport that you ever saw; heaven\nnever yet sent anything like it into this house. The stranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight, let us set\nthem on to do so at once.\u201d\nThe suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two ragged tramps. \u201cListen to me,\u201d said Antinous,\n\u201cthere are some goats\u2019 paunches down at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set aside for supper;\nhe who is victorious and proves himself to be the better man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our\ntable and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at all.\u201d\nThe others all agreed, but Ulysses, to throw them off the scent, said, \u201cSirs, an old man like myself, worn out with\nsuffering, cannot hold his own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on, though I know it can\nonly end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear, however that none of you will give me a foul blow to favour\nIrus and secure him the victory.\u201d\nThey swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath Telemachus put in a word and said,\n\u201cStranger, if you have a mind to settle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here. Whoever strikes you\nwill have to fight more than one. I am host, and the other chiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of\nunderstanding, are of the same mind as I am.\u201d\nEvery one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins, thus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad\nchest and shoulders, and his mighty arms; but Minerva came up to him and made his limbs even stronger still.\nThe suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one would turn towards his neighbour saying, \u201cThe stranger has\nbrought such a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing left of Irus.\u201d\nIrus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded him by force, and brought him [into the\nopen part of the court] in such a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded him and said, \u201cYou\nswaggering bully, you ought never to have been born at all if you are afraid of such an old broken-down creature as\nthis tramp is. I say, therefore\u2014and it shall surely be\u2014if he beats you and proves himself the better man, I shall pack\nyou off on board ship to the mainland and send you to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him. He\nwill cut off your nose and ears, and draw out your entrails for the dogs to eat.\u201d\nThis frightened Irus still more, but they brought him into the middle of the court, and the two men raised their\nhands to fight. Then Ulysses considered whether he should let drive so hard at him as to make an end of him then\nand there, or whether he should give him a lighter blow that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed\nit best to give the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin to suspect who he was. Then they began to fight,\nand Irus hit Ulysses on the right shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck under the ear that broke in the\nbones of his skull, and the blood came gushing out of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth and\nkicking on the ground, but the suitors threw up their hands and nearly died of laughter, as Ulysses caught hold of\nhim by the foot and dragged him into the outer court as far as the gate-house. There he propped him up against the\nwall and put his staff in his hands. \u201cSit here,\u201d said he, \u201cand keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful creature, and\nif you try to make yourself king of the beggars any more you shall fare still worse.\u201d\nThen he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn, over his shoulder with the cord by which it hung, and\nwent back to sit down upon the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing and saluting him,\n\u201cMay Jove, and all the other gods,\u201d said they, \u2018grant you whatever you want for having put an end to the importunity\nof this insatiable tramp. We will take him over to the mainland presently, to king Echetus, who kills every one that\ncomes near him.\u201d\nUlysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat\u2019s paunch before him filled with blood and\nfat. Amphinomus took two loaves out of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he did so in a\ngolden goblet of wine. \u201cGood luck to you,\u201d he said, \u201cfather stranger, you are very badly off at present, but I hope you\nwill have better times by and by.\u201d\nTo this Ulysses answered, \u201cAmphinomus, you seem to be a man of good understanding, as indeed you may well\nbe, seeing whose son you are. I have heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium, a man both brave\nand wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you appear to be a considerable person; listen, therefore, and take\nheed to what I am saying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon earth. As long as heaven\nvouchsafes him health and strength, he thinks that he shall come to no harm hereafter, and even when the blessed\ngods bring sorrow upon him, he bears it as he needs must, and makes the best of it; for God Almighty gives men\ntheir daily minds day by day. I know all about it, for I was a rich man once, and did much wrong in the stubborn-\nness of my pride, and in the confidence that my father and my brothers would support me; therefore let a man fear\nGod in all things always, and take the good that heaven may see fit to send him without vainglory. Consider the\ninfamy of what these suitors are doing; see how they are wasting the estate, and doing dishonour to the wife, of one\nwho is certain to return some day, and that, too, not long hence. Nay, he will be here soon; may heaven send you\n313 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nhome quietly first that you may not meet with him in the day of his coming, for once he is here the suitors and he\nwill not part bloodlessly.\u201d\nWith these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk he put the gold cup again into the hands of\nAmphinomus, who walked away serious and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even so he did not escape\ndestruction, for Minerva had doomed him fall by the hand of Telemachus. So he took his seat again at the place\nfrom which he had come.\nThen Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the suitors, that she might make them still\nmore enamoured of her, and win still further honour from her son and husband. So she feigned a mocking laugh\nand said, \u201cEurynome, I have changed my and have a fancy to show myself to the suitors although I detest them. I\nshould like also to give my son a hint that he had better not have anything more to do with them. They speak fairly\nenough but they mean mischief.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear child,\u201d answered Eurynome, \u201call that you have said is true, go and tell your son about it, but first\nwash yourself and anoint your face. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears; it is not right that you\nshould grieve so incessantly; for Telemachus, whom you always prayed that you might live to see with a beard, is\nalready grown up.\u201d\n\u201cI know, Eurynome,\u201d replied Penelope, \u201cthat you mean well, but do not try and persuade me to wash and to\nanoint myself, for heaven robbed me of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell Autonoe and\nHippodamia that I want them. They must be with me when I am in the cloister; I am not going among the men\nalone; it would not be proper for me to do so.\u201d\nOn this the old woman went out of the room to bid the maids go to their mistress. In the meantime Minerva\nbethought her of another matter, and sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on her couch and\nher limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed grace and beauty over her that all the Achaeans might\nadmire her. She washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears when she goes dancing with the\nGraces; she made her taller and of a more commanding figure, while as for her complexion it was whiter than sawn\nivory. When Minerva had done all this she went away, whereon the maids came in from the women\u2019s room and\nwoke Penelope with the sound of their talking.\n\u201cWhat an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having,\u201d said she, as she passed her hands over her face, \u201cin\nspite of all my misery. I wish Diana would let me die so sweetly now at this very moment, that I might no longer\nwaste in despair for the loss of my dear husband, who possessed every kind of good quality and was the most dis-\ntinguished man among the Achaeans.\u201d\nWith these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but attended by two of her maidens, and\nwhen she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil\nbefore her face, and with a staid maid servant on either side of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpow-\nered and became so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he might win her for his own bed fellow.\n\u201cTelemachus,\u201d said she, addressing her son, \u201cI fear you are no longer so discreet and well conducted as you used\nto be. When you were younger you had a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that you are grown up, though\na stranger to look at you would take you for the son of a well-to-do father as far as size and good looks go, your\nconduct is by no means what it should be. What is all this disturbance that has been going on, and how came you to\nallow a stranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated? What would have happened if he had suffered serious injury while\na suppliant in our house? Surely this would have been very discreditable to you.\u201d\n\u201cI am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure,\u201d replied Telemachus, \u201cI understand all about it and\nknow when things are not as they should be, which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot, however, behave\nwith perfect propriety at all times. First one and then another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of\nmy mind, and I have no one to stand by me. After all, however, this fight between Irus and the stranger did not turn\nout as the suitors meant it to do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo would\nbreak the neck of every one of these wooers of yours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish they might\nall be as limp as Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court. See how he nods his head like a drunken man; he\nhas had such a thrashing that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his home, wherever that may be, for has no\nstrength left in him.\u201d\nThus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, \u201cQueen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the\nAchaeans in Iasian Argos could see you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your house by to-\nmorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the whole world both as regards personal beauty and\nstrength of understanding.\u201d\nTo this Penelope replied, \u201cEurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my beauty whether of face or figure when the\nArgives set sail for Troy and my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs, I should\nboth be more respected and show a better presence to the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the\nafflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all, and when he was leaving home he\n314 The Odyssey\ntook my right wrist in his hand\u2014\u2018Wife, \u2018he said, \u2018we shall not all of us come safe home from Troy, for the Trojans\nfight well both with bow and spear. They are excellent also at fighting from chariots, and nothing decides the issue\nof a fight sooner than this. I know not, therefore, whether heaven will send me back to you, or whether I may not\nfall over there at Troy. In the meantime do you look after things here. Take care of my father and mother as at pres-\nent, and even more so during my absence, but when you see our son growing a beard, then marry whom you will,\nand leave this your present home. This is what he said and now it is all coming true. A night will come when I shall\nhave to yield myself to a marriage which I detest, for Jove has taken from me all hope of happiness. This further\ngrief, moreover, cuts me to the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me after the custom of my country. When\nmen are courting a woman who they think will be a good wife to them and who is of noble birth, and when they are\neach trying to win her for himself, they usually bring oxen and sheep to feast the friends of the lady, and they make\nher magnificent presents, instead of eating up other people\u2019s property without paying for it.\u201d\nThis was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying to get presents out of the suitors, and\nflattering them with fair words which he knew she did not mean.\nThen Antinous said, \u201cQueen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as many presents as you please from any one\nwho will give them to you; it is not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business nor stir from\nwhere we are, till you have married the best man among us whoever he may be.\u201d\nThe others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his servant to bring his present. Antinous\u2019s\nman returned with a large and lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully made brooch\npins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymachus immediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and\namber beads that gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas\u2019s two men returned with some earrings fashioned into three\nbrilliant pendants which glistened most beautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a necklace of the\nrarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful present of some kind.\nThen the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought the presents after her. Meanwhile the\nsuitors took to singing and dancing, and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it grew dark; they then\nbrought in three braziers to give light, and piled them up with chopped firewood very and dry, and they lit torches\nfrom them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then Ulysses said:\n\u201cMaids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to the queen inside the house; sit with her and\namuse her, or spin, and pick wool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till morning, but shall not\nbeat me, for I can stand a great deal.\u201d\nThe maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho began to gibe at him contemptuously. She\nwas daughter to Dolius, but had been brought up by Penelope, who used to give her toys to play with, and looked\nafter her when she was a child; but in spite of all this she showed no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress,\nand used to misconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was in love.\n\u201cPoor wretch,\u201d said she, \u201care you gone clean out of your mind? Go and sleep in some smithy, or place of public\ngossips, instead of chattering here. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters\u2014so many of\nthem too? Has the wine been getting into your head, or do you always babble in this way? You seem to have lost\nyour wits because you beat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man than he does not come and cudgel you about\nthe head till he pack you bleeding out of the house.\u201d\n\u201cVixen,\u201d replied Ulysses, scowling at her, \u201cI will go and tell Telemachus what you have been saying, and he will\nhave you torn limb from limb.\u201d\nWith these words he scared the women, and they went off into the body of the house. They trembled all aver,\nfor they thought he would do as he said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers, holding up torches\nand looking at the people\u2014brooding the while on things that should surely come to pass.\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their insolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become\neven more bitter against them; she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him, which made the\nothers laugh. \u201cListen to me,\u201d said he, \u201cyou suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. It is\nnot for nothing that this man has come to the house of Ulysses; I believe the light has not been coming from the\ntorches, but from his own head\u2014for his hair is all gone, every bit of it.\u201d\nThen turning to Ulysses he said, \u201cStranger, will you work as a servant, if I send you to the wolds and see that\nyou are well paid? Can you build a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year round, and will find\nyou in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not you; for you have got into bad ways, and do not want to work;\nyou had rather fill your belly by going round the country begging.\u201d\n\u201cEurymachus,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201cif you and I were to work one against the other in early summer when the\ndays are at their longest\u2014give me a good scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which will fast the longer\nor mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when the mowing grass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let\nus each take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and endurance: turn me into a four acre field,\nand see whether you or I can drive the straighter furrow. If, again, war were to break out this day, give me a shield,\n315 Compact Anthology of World Literature\na couple of spears and a helmet fitting well upon my temples\u2014you would find me foremost in the fray, and would\ncease your gibes about my belly. You are insolent and cruel, and think yourself a great man because you live in a\nlittle world, ind that a bad one. If Ulysses comes to his own again, the doors of his house are wide, but you will find\nthem narrow when you try to fly through them.\u201d\nEurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, \u201cYou wretch, I will soon pay you out for dar-\ning to say such things to me, and in public too. Has the wine been getting into your head or do you always babble\nin this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you beat the tramp Irus. With this he caught hold of a foot-\nstool, but Ulysses sought protection at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, for he was afraid. The stool hit the\ncupbearer on his right hand and knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back, and his wine-jug fell\nringing to the ground. The suitors in the covered cloister were now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his\nneighbour, saying, \u201cI wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad luck to hide, for all the trouble he gives us.\nWe cannot permit such disturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels are to prevail we shall have no more pleasure\nat our banquet.\u201d\nOn this Telemachus came forward and said, \u201cSirs, are you mad? Can you not carry your meat and your liquor\ndecently? Some evil spirit has possessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you have had your suppers,\nand the sooner you all go home to bed the better.\u201d\nThe suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech; but Amphinomus the son of Nisus, who\nwas son to Aretias, said, \u201cDo not let us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make no answer. Neither let us do\nviolence to the stranger nor to any of Ulysses\u2019 servants. Let the cupbearer go round with the drink-offerings, that we\nmay make them and go home to our rest. As for the stranger, let us leave Telemachus to deal with him, for it is to\nhis house that he has come.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius of Dulichium, servant to Amphinomus, mixed\nthem a bowl of wine and water and handed it round to each of them man by man, whereon they made their\ndrink-offerings to the blessed gods: Then, when they had made their drink-offerings and had drunk each one as he\nwas minded, they took their several ways each of them to his own abode.\nBook XIX\nULYSSES was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby with Minerva\u2019s help he might be able to kill\nthe suitors. Presently he said to Telemachus, \u201cTelemachus, we must get the armour together and take it down inside.\nMake some excuse when the suitors ask you why you have removed it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the\nway of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled and be-\ngrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine,\nand that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms\nsometimes tempts people to use them.\u201d\nTelemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse Euryclea and said, \u201cNurse, shut the women\nup in their room, while I take the armour that my father left behind him down into the store room. No one looks\nafter it now my father is gone, and it has got all smirched with soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it down\nwhere the smoke cannot reach it.\u201d\n\u201cI wish, child,\u201d answered Euryclea, \u201cthat you would take the management of the house into your own hands\naltogether, and look after all the property yourself. But who is to go with you and light you to the store room? The\nmaids would have so, but you would not let them.\n\u201cThe stranger,\u201d said Telemachus, \u201cshall show me a light; when people eat my bread they must earn it, no matter\nwhere they come from.\u201d\nEuryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room. Then Ulysses and his son made all haste\nto take the helmets, shields, and spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in her hand that\nshed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus said, \u201cFather, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with\nthe rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow as with a flaming fire. Surely there is some\ngod here who has come down from heaven.\u201d\n\u201cHush,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201chold your peace and ask no questions, for this is the manner of the gods. Get you to\nyour bed, and leave me here to talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will ask me all sorts\nof questions.\u201d\nOn this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the inner court, to the room in which he always\nslept. There he lay in his bed till morning, while Ulysses was left in the cloister pondering on the means whereby\nwith Minerva\u2019s help he might be able to kill the suitors.\nThen Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana, and they set her a seat inlaid with\nscrolls of silver and ivory near the fire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a footstool all\n316 The Odyssey\nin one piece with the seat itself; and it was covered with a thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came from\nthe women\u2019s room to join her. They set about removing the tables at which the wicked suitors had been dining, and\ntook away the bread that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied the embers out of the\nbraziers, and heaped much wood upon them to give both light and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a\nsecond time and said, \u201cStranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all night and spying upon\nthe women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat your supper there, or you shall be driven out with a firebrand.\u201d\nUlysses scowled at her and answered, \u201cMy good woman, why should you be so angry with me? Is it because\nI am not clean, and my clothes are all in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after the manner of\ntramps and beggars generall? I too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave to\nmany a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants,\nand all the other things which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all\naway from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too come to lose that pride and place in which you now wanton\nabove your fellows; have a care lest you get out of favour with your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come home, for\nthere is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though he be dead as you think he is, yet by Apollo\u2019s will he has\nleft a son behind him, Telemachus, who will note anything done amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now no\nlonger in his boyhood.\u201d\nPenelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, \u201cImpudent baggage, said she, \u201cI see how abominably\nyou are behaving, and you shall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself, that I was going to see\nthe stranger and ask him about my husband, for whose sake I am in such continual sorrow.\u201d\nThen she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, \u201cBring a seat with a fleece upon it, for the stranger to sit\nupon while he tells his story, and listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some questions.\u201d\nEurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as soon as Ulysses had sat down Penelope be-\ngan by saying, \u201cStranger, I shall first ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town and parents.\u201d\n\u201cMadam;\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201cwho on the face of the whole earth can dare to chide with you? Your fame reach-\nes the firmament of heaven itself; you are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness, as the monarch\nover a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its wheat and barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring\nforth lambs, and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues, and his people do good deeds under him. Nev-\nertheless, as I sit here in your house, ask me some other question and do not seek to know my race and family, or\nyou will recall memories that will yet more increase my sorrow. I am full of heaviness, but I ought not to sit weeping\nand wailing in another person\u2019s house, nor is it well to be thus grieving continually. I shall have one of the servants\nor even yourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes swim with tears because I am heavy with wine.\u201d\nThen Penelope answered, \u201cStranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty, whether of face or figure, when the Ar-\ngives set sail for Troy and my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs I should be\nboth more respected and should show a better presence to the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with\nthe afflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our islands \u2014 Dulichium, Same, and\nZacynthus, as also from Ithaca itself, are wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore show\nno attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who say that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time\nbrokenhearted about Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to invent stratagems in order to\ndeceive them. In the first place heaven put it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and to begin\nworking upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to them, \u2018Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead,\nstill, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait \u2014 for I would not have my skill in needlework perish un-\nrecorded\u2014till I have finished making a pall for the hero Laertes, to be ready against the time when death shall take\nhim. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.\u2019 This was what I said, and\nthey assented; whereon I used to keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I would unpick the stitches\nagain by torch light. I fooled them in this way for three years without their finding it out, but as time wore on and I\nwas now in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been accomplished, those good-for-noth-\ning hussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, who broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with\nme, so I was forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now I do not see how I can find any further shift\nfor getting out of this marriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes at the ravages\nthe suitors are making upon his estate, for he is now old enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able to\nlook after his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding all this,\ntell me who you are and where you come from\u2014for you must have had father and mother of some sort; you cannot\nbe the son of an oak or of a rock.\u201d\nThen Ulysses answered, \u201cmadam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist in asking me about my family, I will an-\nswer, no matter what it costs me: people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long as I have, and\nsuffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless, as regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There\nis a fair and fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled and there are nine cities in it: the people\n317 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nspeak many different languages which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans, Dorians of\nthree-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a great town there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every nine years\nhad a conference with Jove himself. Minos was father to Deucalion, whose son I am, for Deucalion had two sons\nIdomeneus and myself. Idomeneus sailed for Troy, and I, who am the younger, am called Aethon; my brother, how-\never, was at once the older and the more valiant of the two; hence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him\nhospitality, for the winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy, carrying him out of his course from cape Ma-\nlea and leaving him in Amnisus off the cave of Ilithuia, where the harbours are difficult to enter and he could hardly\nfind shelter from the winds that were then xaging. As soon as he got there he went into the town and asked for\nIdomeneus, claiming to be his old and valued friend, but Idomeneus had already set sail for Troy some ten or twelve\ndays earlier, so I took him to my own house and showed him every kind of hospitality, for I had abundance of ev-\nerything. Moreover, I fed the men who were with him with barley meal from the public store, and got subscriptions\nof wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to their heart\u2019s content. They stayed with me twelve days, for there was a gale\nblowing from the North so strong that one could hardly keep one\u2019s feet on land. I suppose some unfriendly god had\nraised it for them, but on the thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they got away.\u201d\nMany a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept as she listened, for her heart was melt-\ned. As the snow wastes upon the mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed upon it\nand thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even so did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband\nwho was all the time sitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was for her, but he kept his eyes as hard as or iron\nwithout letting them so much as quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she had relieved herself\nby weeping, she turned to him again and said: \u201cNow, stranger, I shall put you to the test and see whether or no you\nreally did entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did. Tell me, then, how he was dressed, what kind of a\nman he was to look at, and so also with his companions.\u201d\n\u201cMadam,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201cit is such a long time ago that I can hardly say. Twenty years are come and gone\nsince he left my home, and went elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect. Ulysses wore a mantle of\npurple wool, double lined, and it was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this\nthere was a device that showed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting\nupon the ground. Every one marvelled at the way in which these things had been done in gold, the dog looking at\nthe fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was struggling convulsively to escape. As for the shirt that he wore next\nhis skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration of\nall the women who beheld it. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, that I do not know whether Ulyss-\nes wore these clothes when he left home, or whether one of his companions had given them to him while he was on\nhis voyage; or possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a present of them, for he was a man of\nmany friends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple\nmantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down to his feet, and I sent him on board his ship with every mark of\nhonour. He had a servant with him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what he was like; his shoulders\nwere hunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly hair. His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with\ngreater familiarity than he did any of the others, as being the most like-minded with himself.\u201d\nPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable proofs that Ulysses laid before her; and\nwhen she had again found relief in tears she said to him, \u201cStranger, I was already disposed to pity you, but hence-\nforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of.\nI took them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and I gave him also the gold brooch to wear as an\nornament. Alas! I shall never welcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that detested city\nwhose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.\u201d\nThen Ulysses answered, \u201cMadam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure yourself further by grieving thus bitterly for\nyour loss, though I can hardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and borne him chil-\ndren, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even though he were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was\nlike a god. Still, cease your tears and listen to what I can tell I will hide nothing from you, and can say with perfect\ntruth that I have lately heard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the Thesprotians, and is\nbringing back much valuable treasure that he has begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his\ncrew were lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the sun-god were angry with him because his\nmen had slaughtered the sun-god\u2019s cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses stuck to the keel of the\nship and was drifted on to the land of the Phaecians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him as\nthough he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ul-\nysses would have been here long ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering wealth; for there\nis no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians\ntold me all this, and he swore to me\u2014making drink-offerings in his house as he did so\u2014that the ship was by the\nwater side and the crew found who would take Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first, for there happened\n318 The Odyssey\nto be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, but he showed me all treasure Ulysses\nhad got together, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep his family for ten generations; but\nthe king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he might learn Jove\u2019s mind from the high oak tree, and know wheth-\ner after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret. So you may know he is safe and will be\nhere shortly; he is close at hand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I will confirm my\nwords with an oath, and call Jove who is the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Ulysses\nto which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come to pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year;\nwith the end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.\u201d\n\u201cMay it be even so,\u201d answered Penelope; \u201cif your words come true you shall have such gifts and such good will\nfrom me that all who see you shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses will not return,\nneither will you get your escort hence, for so surely as that Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any such\nmasters in the house as he was, to receive honourable strangers or to further them on their way home. And now,\nyou maids, wash his feet for him, and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may be warm and\nquiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him again, that he may sit in the cloister and take his\nmeals with Telemachus. It shall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil to him; like it or not,\nhe shall have no more to do in this house. For how, sir, shall you be able to learn whether or no I am superior to\nothers of my sex both in goodness of heart and understanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad?\nMen live but for a little season; if they are hard, and deal hardly, people wish them ill so long as they are alive, and\nspeak contemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that is righteous and deals righteously, the people tell of\nhis praise among all lands, and many shall call him blessed.\u201d\nUlysses answered, \u201cMadam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the day that I left the snowy ranges of\nCrete to go on shipboard. I will lie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after night have I passed\nin any rough sleeping place, and waited for morning. Nor, again, do I like having my feet washed; I shall not let any\nof the young hussies about your house touch my feet; but, if you have any old and respectable woman who has gone\nthrough as much trouble as I have, I will allow her to wash them.\u201d\nTo this Penelope said, \u201cMy dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet came to my house there never was one who\nspoke in all things with such admirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the house a most respectable\nold woman\u2014the same who received my poor dear husband in her arms the night he was born, and nursed him\nin infancy. She is very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.\u201d \u201cCome here,\u201d said she, \u201cEuryclea, and wash your\nmaster\u2019s age-mate; I suppose Ulysses\u2019 hands and feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages all of\nus dreadfully fast.\u201d\nOn these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she began to weep and made lamentation\nsaying, \u201cMy dear child, I cannot think whatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever more god-fearing\nthan yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one in the whole world ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him\nfiner hecatombs when you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see your son grow up to take\nafter you; yet see how he has prevented you alone from ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the\nwomen in some foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are gibing at him as all these sluts here have been gibing\nyou. I do not wonder at your not choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which they have insulted you; I\nwill wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope has said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for Penelo-\npe\u2019s sake and for your own, for you have raised the most lively feelings of compassion in my mind; and let me say\nthis moreover, which pray attend to; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come here before now, but I make\nbold to say that no one ever yet came who was so like Ulysses in figure, voice, and feet as you are.\u201d\n\u201cThose who have seen us both,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201chave always said we were wonderfully like each other, and\nnow you have noticed it too.\nThen the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash his feet, and poured plenty of cold\nwater into it, adding hot till the bath was warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long he turned away from the\nlight, for it occurred to him that when the old woman had hold of his leg she would recognize a certain scar which\nit bore, whereon the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as she began washing her master, she at\nonce knew the scar as one that had been given him by a wild boar when he was hunting on Mount Parnassus with\nhis excellent grandfather Autolycus\u2014who was the most accomplished thief and perjurer in the whole world\u2014and\nwith the sons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had endowed him with this gift, for he used to burn the thigh bones of\ngoats and kids to him, so he took pleasure in his companionship. It happened once that Autolycus had gone to Itha-\nca and had found the child of his daughter just born. As soon as he had done supper Euryclea set the infant upon\nhis knees and said, you must find a name for your grandson; you greatly wished that you might have one.\u201d\n\u2018Son-in-law and daughter,\u201d replied Autolycus, \u201ccall the child thus: I am highly displeased with a large number of\npeople in one place and another, both men and women; so name the child \u2018Ulysses,\u2019 or the child of anger. When he\ngrows up and comes to visit his mother\u2019s family on Mount Parnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a\n319 Compact Anthology of World Literature\npresent and will send him on his way rejoicing.\u201d\nUlysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from Autolycus, who with his sons shook hands with\nhim and gave him welcome. His grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his head, and both\nhis beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to get dinner ready, and they did as he told them. They brought\nin a five year old bull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it into joints; these they then cut carefully up into smaller\npieces and spitted them; they roasted them sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus through the livelong\nday to the going down of the sun they feasted, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when\nthe sun set and it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of Autolycus went out with their hounds\nhunting, and Ulysses went too. They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy upland\nvalleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus,\nthey came to a mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the beast they were chasing, and\nafter them came the sons of Autolycus, among whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had a long spear in\nhis hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not\nget through it, nor could the sun\u2019s rays pierce it, and the ground underneath lay thick with fallen leaves. The boar\nheard the noise of the men\u2019s feet, and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to him, so rushed\nfrom his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and stood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the first\nto raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the boar was too quick for him, and charged him sideways,\nripping him above the knee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for the boar, Ulysses hit\nhim on the right shoulder, and the point of the spear went right through him, so that he fell groaning in the dust\nuntil the life went out of him. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound\nUlysses\u2019 wound; then, after saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But when Au-\ntolycus and his sons had thoroughly healed Ulysses, they made him some splendid presents, and sent him back to\nIthaca with much mutual good will. When he got back, his father and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked\nhim all about it, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them how the boar had ripped him when he\nwas out hunting with Autolycus and his sons on Mount Parnassus.\nAs soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well hold of it, she recognized it and\ndropped the foot at once. The leg fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that all the water was\nspilt on the ground; Euryclea\u2019s eyes between her joy and her grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but she\ncaught Ulysses by the beard and said, \u201cMy dear child, I am sure you must be Ulysses himself, only I did not know\nyou till I had actually touched and handled you.\u201d\nAs she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell her that her dear husband was in the\nhouse, but Penelope was unable to look in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva had diverted\nher attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with his right hand and with his left drew her close to him,\nand said, \u201cNurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your own breast, now that after twenty\nyears of wandering I am at last come to my own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to rec-\nognize me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about it any one else in the house, for if you do I tell you\u2014and\nit shall surely be\u2014that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors, I will not spare you, though you are my\nown nurse, when I am killing the other women.\u201d\n\u201cMy child,\u201d answered Euryclea, \u201cwhat are you talking about? You know very well that nothing can either bend\nor break me. I will hold my tongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and lay my saying to your\nheart, when heaven has delivered the suitors into your hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who\nhave been ill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless.\u201d\nAnd Ulysses answered, \u201cNurse, you ought not to speak in that way; I am well able to form my own opinion\nabout one and all of them; hold your tongue and leave everything to heaven.\u201d\nAs he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water, for the first had been all spilt; and when she\nhad washed him and anointed him with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to warm himself, and hid the\nscar under his rags. Then Penelope began talking to him and said:\n\u201cStranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another matter. It is indeed nearly bed time\u2014for those,\nat least, who can sleep in spite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such unmeasurable woe, that\neven by day when I am attending to my duties and looking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting\nduring the whole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed, I lie awake thinking, and my heart\ncomes a prey to the most incessant and cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in the\nearly spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many a plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap\nshe killed her own child Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so does my mind toss and turn in its uncertainty whether\nI ought to stay with my son here, and safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out\nof regard to public opinion and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is not now time for me to go with\n320 The Odyssey\nthe best of these suitors who are wooing me and making me such magnificent presents. As long as my son was\nstill young, and unable to understand, he would not hear of my leaving my husband\u2019s house, but now that he is full\ngrown he begs and prays me to do so, being incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his property.\nListen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret it for me if you can. I have twenty geese about the house that\neat mash out of a trough, and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great eagle came swooping down\nfrom a mountain, and dug his curved beak into the neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently he\nsoared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard; whereon I wept in my room till all my maids gath-\nered round me, so piteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he came back again, and\nperching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with human voice, and told me to leave off crying. \u2018Be of good courage,\u2019\nhe said, \u2018daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen that shall surely come to pass. The geese\nare the suitors, and I am no longer an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who will bring\nthese suitors to a disgraceful end.\u2019 On this I woke, and when I looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their\nmash as usual.\u201d\n\u201cThis dream, Madam,\u201d replied Ulysses, \u201ccan admit but of one interpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told\nyou how it shall be fulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one single one of them will escape.\u201d\nAnd Penelope answered, \u201cStranger, dreams are very curious and unaccountable things, and they do not by any\nmeans invariably come true. There are two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed; the one is of\nhorn, and the other ivory. Those that come through the gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn\nmean something to those that see them. I do not think, however, that my own dream came through the gate of\nhorn, though I and my son should be most thankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say\u2014and lay my\nsaying to your heart\u2014the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened day that is to sever me from the house of Ul-\nysses, for I am about to hold a tournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes in the court, one in front\nof the other, like the stays upon which a ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot an arrow through\nthe whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the same thing, and whichever of them can string the bow most\neasily, and send his arrow through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit this house of my lawful husband,\nso goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even so, I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.\u201d\nThen Ulysses answered, \u201cMadam wife of Ulysses, you need not defer your tournament, for Ulysses will return\nere ever they can string the bow, handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the iron.\u201d\nTo this Penelope said, \u201cAs long, sir, as you will sit here and talk to me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still,\npeople cannot do permanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on earth a time for all things.\nI will therefore go upstairs and recline upon that couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from the\nday Ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name.\u201d\nShe then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by her maidens, and when there, she lamented\nher dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyelids.\nBook XX\nULYSSES slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock\u2019s hide, on the top of which he threw several skins\nof the sheep the suitors had eaten, and Eurynome threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself down. There,\nthen, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in which he should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women\nwho had been in the habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the house giggling and laughing with one\nanother. This made Ulysses very angry, and he doubted whether to get up and kill every single one of them then\nand there, or to let them sleep one more and last time with the suitors. His heart growled within him, and as a bitch\nwith puppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so did his heart growl with anger at the evil\ndeeds that were being done: but he beat his breast and said, \u201cHeart, be still, you had worse than this to bear on the\nday when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in silence till your cunning got you safe\nout of the cave, though you made sure of being killed.\u201d\nThus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he tossed about as one who turns a paunch\nfull of blood and fat in front of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other, that he may get it cooked\nas soon as possible, even so did he turn himself about from side to side, thinking all the time how, single handed as\nhe was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked suitors. But by and by Minerva came down\nfrom heaven in the likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, \u201cMy poor unhappy man, why do you lie\nawake in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe inside it, and so is your son who is just such a young man as\nany father may be proud of.\u201d\n\u201cGoddess,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201call that you have said is true, but I am in some doubt as to how I shall be able to\nkill these wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always are. And there is this further\ndifficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing that with Jove\u2019s and your assistance I succeed in killing them,\n321 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nI must ask you to consider where I am to escape to from their avengers when it is all over.\u201d\n\u201cFor shame,\u201d replied Minerva, \u201cwhy, any one else would trust a worse ally than myself, even though that ally\nwere only a mortal and less wise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout in all\nyour troubles? I tell you plainly that even though there were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us,\nyou should take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you. But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie\nawake all night, and you shall be out of your troubles before long.\u201d\nAs she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to Olympus.\nWhile Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that eased the burden of his sorrows, his admi-\nrable wife awoke, and sitting up in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping she prayed to\nDiana saying, \u201cGreat Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove, drive an arrow into my heart and slay me; or let some whirl-\nwind snatch me up and bear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the mouths of overflowing Oceanus,\nas it did the daughters of Pandareus. The daughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods killed\nthem, so they were left orphans. But Venus took care of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno\ntaught them to excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an imposing presence, and\nMinerva endowed them with every kind of accomplishment; but one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to\nsee Jove about getting them married (for well does he know both what shall happen and what not happen to every\none) the storm winds came and spirited them away to become handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I wish\nthat the gods who live in heaven would hide me from mortal sight, or that fair Diana might strike me, for I would\nfain go even beneath the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Ulysses only, and without having to yield\nmyself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no matter how much people may grieve by day, they can put up with it\nso long as they can sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people forget good and ill alike; whereas\nmy misery haunts me even in my dreams. This very night methought there was one lying by my side who was like\nUlysses as he was when he went away with his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream, but the very\ntruth itself.\u201d\nOn this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping, and it puzzled him, for it seemed as though\nshe already knew him and was by his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had lain, and\nset them on a seat in the cloister, but he took the bullock\u2019s hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands to heaven,\nand prayed, saying \u201cFather Jove, since you have seen fit to bring me over land and sea to my own home after all the\nafflictions you have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one or other of those who are now wak-\ning within the house, and let me have another sign of some kind from outside.\u201d\nThus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high up among the from the splendour of\nOlympus, and Ulysses was glad when he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman from hard by\nin the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another sign. There were twelve miller-women whose business\nit was to grind wheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had ground their task and had gone to take\ntheir rest, but this one had not yet finished, for she was not so strong as they were, and when she heard the thunder\nshe stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master. \u201cFather Jove,\u201d said she, \u201cyou who rule over heaven and earth,\nyou have thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and this means something for somebody;\ngrant the prayer, then, of me your poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very last day that the suitors\ndine in the house of Ulysses. They have worn me out with the labour of grinding meal for them, and I hope they\nmay never have another dinner anywhere at all.\u201d\nUlysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman\u2019s speech, and by the thunder, for he\nknew they meant that he should avenge himself on the suitors.\nThen the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth; Telemachus also rose and put on his\nclothes. He girded his sword about his shoulder, bound his sandals on his comely feet, and took a doughty spear\nwith a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold of the cloister and said to Euryclea, \u201cNurse, did you\nmake the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let him shift for himself?\u2014for my mother,\ngood woman though she is, has a way of paying great attention to second-rate people, and of neglecting others who\nare in reality much better men.\u201d\n\u201cDo not find fault child,\u201d said Euryclea, \u201cwhen there is no one to find fault with. The stranger sat and drank his\nwine as long as he liked: your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and he said he would not. When\nhe wanted to go to bed she told the servants to make one for him, but he said he was re such wretched outcast that\nhe would not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having an undressed bullock\u2019s hide and some sheep-\nskins put for him in the cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.\u201d\nThen Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans were meeting in assembly; he had his\nspear in his hand, and he was not alone, for his two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the maids and said,\n\u201cCome, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put the covers on\nthe seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean out the mixing-jugs and the cups, and for\n322 The Odyssey\nwater from the fountain at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early, for it is a feast day.\u201d\nThus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them went to the fountain for water, and the\nothers set themselves busily to work about the house. The men who were in attendance on the suitors also came\nup and began chopping firewood. By and by the women returned from the fountain, and the swineherd came after\nthem with the three best pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about the premises, and then he said good-hu-\nmouredly to Ulysses, \u201cStranger, are the suitors treating you any better now, or are they as insolent as ever?\u201d\n\u201cMay heaven,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201crequite to them the wickedness with which they deal high-handedly in an-\nother man\u2019s house without any sense of shame.\u201d\nThus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up, for he too was bringing in his best goats\nfor the suitors\u2019 dinner; and he had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse, and then\nMelanthius began gibing at Ulysses. \u201cAre you still here, stranger,\u201d said he, \u201cto pester people by begging about the\nhouse? Why can you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an understanding before we have given each\nother a taste of our fists. You beg without any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the Achaeans,\nas well as here?\u201d\nUlysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third man, Philoetius, joined them, who was\nbringing in a barren heifer and some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there to take people\nover when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made his heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and\nthen went up to the swineherd. \u201cWho, Swineherd,\u201d said he, \u201cis this stranger that is lately come here? Is he one of\nyour men? What is his family? Where does he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some great man,\nbut the gods give sorrow to whom they will\u2014even to kings if it so pleases them\nAs he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand; \u201cGood day to you, father stranger,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cyou seem to be very poorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by and by. Father Jove, of all gods\nyou are the most malicious. We are your own children, yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions.\nA sweat came over me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with tears, for he reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear\nis going about in just such rags as this man\u2019s are, if indeed he is still among the living. If he is already dead and in\nthe house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master, who made me his stockman when I was quite young among the\nCephallenians, and now his cattle are countless; no one could have done better with them than I have, for they have\nbred like ears of corn; nevertheless I have to keep bringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed of his son\nthough he is in the house, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already eager to divide Ulysses\u2019 property among\nthem because he has been away so long. I have often thought\u2014only it would not be right while his son is living\u2014of\ngoing off with the cattle to some foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still harder to stay here and be ill-treated\nabout other people\u2019s herds. My position is intolerable, and I should long since have run away and put myself under\nthe protection of some other chief, only that I believe my poor master will yet return, and send all these suitors\nflying out of the house.\u201d\n\u201cStockman,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201cyou seem to be a very well-disposed person, and I can see that you are a man\nof sense. Therefore I will tell you, and will confirm my words with an oath: by Jove, the chief of all gods, and by that\nhearth of Ulysses to which I am now come, Ulysses shall return before you leave this place, and if you are so mind-\ned you shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here.\u201d\n\u201cIf Jove were to bring this to pass,\u201d replied the stockman, \u201cyou should see how I would do my very utmost to\nhelp him.\u201d\nAnd in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to murder Telemachus: but a bird flew near\nthem on their left hand\u2014an eagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, \u201cMy friends, this plot of ours\nto murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to dinner instead.\u201d\nThe others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the benches and seats. They sacrificed the\nsheep, goats, pigs, and the heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them round. They mixed the\nwine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every man his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in\nthe breadbaskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that\nwere before them.\nTelemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that was paved with stone; he gave him a\nshabby-looking seat at a little table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought to him, with his\nwine in a gold cup. \u201cSit there,\u201d said he, \u201cand drink your wine among the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes\nand blows of the suitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to Ulysses, and has passed from him to me. There-\nfore, suitors, keep your hands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will be mischief.\u201d\nThe suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech; then Antinous said, \u201cWe do not like such\nlanguage but we will put up with it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If Jove had let us we should\nhave put a stop to his brave talk ere now.\u201d\n323 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy heca-\ntomb through the city, and the Achaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.\nThen they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every man his portion, and feasted to their hearts\u2019\ncontent; those who waited at table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had, for Telemachus had told\nthem to do so.\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their insolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become\nstill more bitter against them. Now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was Ctesippus,\nand who came from Same. This man, confident in his great wealth, was paying court to the wife of Ulysses, and said\nto the suitors, \u201cHear what I have to say. The stranger has already had as large a portion as any one else; this is well,\nfor it is not right nor reasonable to ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I will, however, make him a\npresent on my own account, that he may have something to give to the bath-woman, or to some other of Ulysses\u2019\nservants.\u201d\nAs he spoke he picked up a heifer\u2019s foot from the meat-basket in which it lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulyss-\nes turned his head a little aside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion as he did so, and it hit the wall, not\nhim. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to Ctesippus, \u201cIt is a good thing for you,\u201d said he, \u201cthat the stranger turned\nhis head so that you missed him. If you had hit him I should have run you through with my spear, and your father\nwould have had to see about getting you buried rather than married in this house. So let me have no more unseem-\nly behaviour from any of you, for I am grown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is go-\ning on, instead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long seen you killing my sheep and making free\nwith my corn and wine: I have put up with this, for one man is no match for many, but do me no further violence.\nStill, if you wish to kill me, kill me; I would far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after day\u2014guests\ninsulted, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way.\u201d\nThey all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said, \u201cNo one should take offence at what has just\nbeen said, nor gainsay it, for it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the stranger, or any one else of\nthe servants who are about the house; I would say, however, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother, which\nI trust may commend itself to both. \u2018As long,\u2019 I would say, \u2018as you had ground for hoping that Ulysses would one\nday come home, no one could complain of your waiting and suffering the suitors to be in your house. It would have\nbeen better that he should have returned, but it is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all\nthis quietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the best man, and the one who makes her the most advan-\ntageous offer. Thus you will yourself be able to manage your own inheritance, and to eat and drink in peace, while\nyour mother will look after some other man\u2019s house, not yours.\u201d\u2019\nTo this Telemachus answered, \u201cBy Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of my unhappy father, who has either\nperished far from Ithaca, or is wandering in some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my mother\u2019s\nmarriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she will, and I will give her numberless gifts into the\nbargain, but I dare not insist point blank that she shall leave the house against her own wishes. Heaven forbid that I\nshould do this.\u201d\nMinerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set their wits wandering; but they were\nlaughing with a forced laughter. Their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears, and their hearts\nwere heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this and said, \u201cUnhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a\nshroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are wet with tears; the air is alive with wailing\nvoices; the walls and roof-beams drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are full of ghosts\ntrooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted out of heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus then said, \u201cThis stranger who has lately\ncome here has lost his senses. Servants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it so dark here.\u201d\nBut Theoclymenus said, \u201cEurymachus, you need not send any one with me. I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet\nof my own, to say nothing of an understanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me, for I see mischief\noverhanging you, from which not one of you men who are insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of\nUlysses will be able to escape.\u201d\nHe left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him welcome, but the suitors kept looking at\none another and provoking Telemachus fly laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to him, \u201cTelemachus,\nyou are not happy in your guests; first you have this importunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and\nhas no skill for work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and now here is another fellow who is setting him-\nself up as a prophet. Let me persuade you, for it will be much better, to put them on board ship and send them off to\nthe Sicels to sell for what they will bring.\u201d\nTelemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father, expecting every moment that he would begin\nhis attack upon the suitors.\nMeanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had had a rich seat placed for her facing the court and\n324 The Odyssey\ncloisters, so that she could hear what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid merriment;\nit had been both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet to come, and\nnothing can be conceived more gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a brave man were soon to lay before\nthem\u2014for they had brought their doom upon themselves.\nBook XXI\nMINERVA now put it in Penelope\u2019s mind to make the suitors try their skill with the bow and with the iron\naxes, in contest among themselves, as a means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and got the\nstore room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of ivory; she then went with her maidens into the\nstore room at the end of the house, where her husband\u2019s treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and\nwhere was also his bow, and the quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met\nin Lacedaemon\u2014Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in with one another in Messene at the house of Ortilochus,\nwhere Ulysses was staying in order to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the Messenians\nhad carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had sailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest\nof these Ulysses took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent him on a\nmission to recover them. Iphitus had gone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares that he had lost, and\nthe mule foals that were running with them. These mares were the death of him in the end, for when he went to the\nhouse of Jove\u2019s son, mighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules to his shame killed him,\nthough he was his guest, for he feared not heaven\u2019s vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set\nbefore Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares himself. It was when claiming these that\nIphitus met Ulysses, and gave him the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on his death\nhad been left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return a sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast\nfriendship, although they never visited at one another\u2019s houses, for Jove\u2019s son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could\ndo so. This bow, then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when he sailed for Troy; he\nhad used it so long as he had been at home, but had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.\nPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store room; the carpenter had planed this duly, and had\ndrawn a line on it so as to get it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the doors. She loosed\nthe strap from the handle of the door, put in the key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts that held\nthe doors; these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised\nplatform, where the chests stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along with fragrant herbs: reaching\nthence, she took down the bow with its bow case from the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees,\nweeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when her tears had relieved her, she went to the cloister\nwhere the suitors were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along\nwith her came her maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her husband had won as\nprizes. When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, hold-\ning a veil before her face, and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:\n\u201cListen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of this house because its owner has been long\nabsent, and without other pretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prize that you are contend-\ning for, I will bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his\narrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and\nso abounding in wealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.\u201d\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron before the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as\nhe took them to do as she had bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master\u2019s bow, but An-\ntinous scolded them. \u201cYou country louts,\u201d said he, \u201csilly simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mis-\ntress by crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your\ndinners in silence, or go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors shall have to contend\nfor it with might and main, for we shall find it no light matter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of\nus all who is such another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember him, though I was then only a child.\u201d\nThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to string the bow and shoot through the\niron, whereas in fact he was to be the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses, whom he was\ndishonouring in his own house\u2014egging the others on to do so also.\nThen Telemachus spoke. \u201cGreat heavens!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cJove must have robbed me of my senses. Here is my\ndear and excellent mother saying she will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying myself as\nthough there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the contest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is for a\nwoman whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet in Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know\nthis as well as I do; what need have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no excuses for delay,\n325 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nbut let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too will make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through\nthe iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my father\nwon before me.\u201d\nAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him, and took his sword from his shoulder.\nFirst he set the axes in a row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had Wade straight by line. Then he\nstamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, though he\nhad never seen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement to make trial of the bow; thrice\ndid he tug at it, trying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though he had hoped\nto string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for the fourth time, and would have strung it had not\nUlysses made a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:\n\u201cAlas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too young, and have not yet reached my full\nstrength so as to be able to hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are stronger than I, make\ntrial of the bow and get this contest settled.\u201d\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led into the house] with the arrow standing\nagainst the top of the bow. Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous said:\n\u201cCome on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the place at which the. cupbearer begins when\nhe is handing round the wine.\u201d\nThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of OEnops was the first to rise. He was sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat\nin the corner near the mixing-bowl. He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and was indignant with the\nothers. He was now the first to take the bow and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he\ncould not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard work, they therefore soon grew tired, and\nhe said to the suitors, \u201cMy friends, I cannot string it; let another have it; this bow shall take the life and soul out of\nmany a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live after having missed the prize that we have so long striven\nfor, and which has brought us so long together. Some one of us is even now hoping and praying that he may marry\nPenelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo and make bridal offerings to some other woman,\nand let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it is to win her.\u201d\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door, with the arrow standing against the tip of the bow.\nThen he took his seat again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him saying:\n\u201cLeiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and intolerable; it makes me angry to listen to\nyou. Shall, then, this bow take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend it yourself? True,\nyou were not born to be an archer, but there are others who will soon string it.\u201d\nThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, \u201cLook sharp, light a fire in the court, and set a seat hard by with a\nsheep skin on it; bring us also a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us warm the bow and grease\nit we will then make trial of it again, and bring the contest to an end.\u201d\nMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside it. He also brought a great ball of lard from\nwhat they had in the house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but they were none of them\nnearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless there still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were the ring-\nleaders among the suitors and much the foremost among them all.\nThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and Ulysses followed them. When they had got\noutside the gates and the outer yard, Ulysses said to them quietly:\n\u201cStockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in doubt whether to say or no; but I\nthink I will say it. What manner of men would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back here\nall of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do\u2014to side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?\u201d\n\u201cFather Jove,\u201d answered the stockman, \u201cwould indeed that you might so ordain it. If some god were but to bring\nUlysses back, you should see with what might and main I would fight for him.\u201d\nIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return; when, therefore, he saw for certain\nwhat mind they were of, Ulysses said, \u201cIt is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last, in the twenti-\neth year, I am come back to my own country. I find that you two alone of all my servants are glad that I should do\nso, for I have not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you two, therefore, will I unfold the truth as it\nshall be. If heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both of you, will give you house and\nholding close to my own, and you shall be to me as though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now\ngive you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is the scar from the boar\u2019s tooth that\nripped me when I was out hunting on Mount Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.\u201d\nAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they had examined it thoroughly, they both of\nthem wept about Ulysses, threw their arms round him and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses kissed their\nhands and faces in return. The sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them\nand said:\n326 The Odyssey\n\u201cCease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and tell those who a are within. When\nyou go in, do so separately, not both together; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards; Let this moreover be the\ntoken between us; the suitors will all of them try to prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you,\ntherefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying it about, and tell the women to close the doors of\ntheir apartment. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they must not come out;\nthey must keep quiet, and stay where they are at their work. And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of\nthe outer court, and to bind them securely at once.\u201d\nWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat that he had left. Presently, his two ser-\nvants followed him inside.\nAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming it by the fire, but even so he could\nnot string it, and he was greatly grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, \u201cI grieve for myself and for us all; I grieve\nthat I shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not care nearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other\nwomen in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we\ncannot string his bow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.\u201d\n\u201cIt shall not be so, Eurymachus,\u201d said Antinous, \u201cand you know it yourself. To-day is the feast of Apollo\nthroughout all the land; who can string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side\u2014as for the axes they can stay\nwhere they are, for no one is likely to come to the house and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his\ncups, that we may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will tell Melanthius to bring us in\nsome goats to-morrow\u2014the best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty archer, and again make\ntrial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end.\u201d\nThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages\nfilled the mixing-bowls with wine and water and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering. Then,\nwhen they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he desired, Ulysses craftily said:\n\u201cSuitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am minded. I appeal more especially to Eury-\nmachus, and to Antinous who has just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and leave the\nmatter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give victory to whom it will. For the moment, however, give me\nthe bow that I may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I still have as much strength as I\nused to have, or whether travel and neglect have made an end of it.\u201d\nThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow; Antinous therefore rebuked him\nfiercely saying, \u201cWretched creature, you have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to\nthink yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your betters, without having any smaller portion\nserved you than we others have had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other beggar or stranger has\nbeen allowed to hear what we say among ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with\nall those drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous\namong the Lapithae. When the wine had got into his head he went mad and did ill deeds about the house of Pei-\nrithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils;\nthen they dragged him through the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his\ncrime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war between mankind and the centaurs, but he\nbrought it upon himself through his own drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with you\nif you string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one here, for we shall at once ship you off to king Echetus,\nwho kills every one that comes near him: you will never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into\na quarrel with men younger than yourself.\u201d\nPenelope then spoke to him. \u201cAntinous,\u201d said she, \u201cit is not right that you should ill-treat any guest of Telema-\nchus who comes to this house. If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of Ulysses, can\nyou suppose that he would take me home with him and make me his wife? Even the man himself can have no such\nidea in his mind: none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would be out of all reason.\u201d\n\u201cQueen Penelope,\u201d answered Eurymachus, \u201cwe do not suppose that this man will take you away with him; it is\nimpossible; but we are afraid lest some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go gossiping\nabout and say, \u2018These suitors are a feeble folk; they are paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one\nof them was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung it at once and sent an arrow\nthrough the iron.\u2019 This is what will be said, and it will be a scandal against us.\u201d\n\u201cEurymachus,\u201d Penelope answered, \u201cpeople who persist in eating up the estate of a great chieftain and dishon-\nouring his house must not expect others to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as you think\nthey will? This stranger is strong and well-built, he says moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and\nlet us see whether he can string it or no. I say\u2014and it shall surely be\u2014that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of\nstringing it, I will give him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and robbers, and a sharp\nsword. I will also give him sandals, and will see him sent safely whereever he wants to go.\u201d\n327 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThen Telemachus said, \u201cMother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in the islands that are over against Elis\nwho has the right to let any one have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the other, not even\nthough I choose to make the stranger a present of the bow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then,\nwithin the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your ser-\nvants. This bow is a man\u2019s matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am master here.\u201d\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son\u2019s saying in her heart. Then going upstairs with her\nhandmaids into her room, she mourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.\nThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses, but the suitors clamoured at him from all\nparts of the cloisters, and one of them said, \u201cYou idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out of your wits? If\nApollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place, and\nworry you to death.\u201d\nEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow down then and there, but Telemachus\nshouted out at him from the other side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, \u201cFather Eumaeus, bring the bow\non in spite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you with stones back to the country, for I am the better man of the\ntwo. I wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as I am than you, I would soon send some\nof them off sick and sorry, for they mean mischief.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put them in a better humour with Telemachus;\nso Eumaeus brought the bow on and placed it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called Euryclea\napart and said to her, \u201cEuryclea, Telemachus says you are to close the doors of the women\u2019s apartments. If they hear\nany groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not to come out, but are to keep quiet and stay\nwhere they are at their work.\u201d\nEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women\u2019s apartments.\nMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the outer court. There was a ship\u2019s cable of\nbyblus fibre lying in the gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in again, resuming the seat that\nhe had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way\nabout, and proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating into its two horns during his absence. Then\nwould one turn towards his neighbour saying, \u201cThis is some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has got one like it at\nhome, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike style does the old vagabond handle it.\u201d\nAnother said, \u201cI hope he may be no more successful in other things than he is likely to be in stringing this bow.\u201d\nBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new\npeg of his lyre and makes the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand to prove the string,\nand it sang sweetly under his touch like the twittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour\nas they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly as a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he\nheard the omen that the son of scheming Saturn had sent him.\nHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table\u2014for those which the Achaeans were so shortly about to taste\nwere all inside the quiver\u2014he laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow and the string\ntoward him, still seated on his seat. When he had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the han-\ndle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through them, and into the outer courtyard. Then\nhe said to Telemachus:\n\u201cYour guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I aimed at, and I was not long in stringing\nmy bow. I am still strong, and not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for the Achaeans to\nprepare supper while there is still daylight, and then otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are\nthe crowning ornaments of a banquet.\u201d\nAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on his sword, grasped his spear, and\nstood armed beside his father\u2019s seat.\nBook XXII\nTHEN Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement with his bow and his quiver full of\narrows. He shed the arrows on to the ground at his feet and said, \u201cThe mighty contest is at an end. I will now see\nwhether Apollo will vouchsafe it to me to hit another mark which no man has yet hit.\u201d\nOn this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take up a two-handled gold cup to drink his\nwine and already had it in his hands. He had no thought of death\u2014who amongst all the revellers would think that\none man, however brave, would stand alone among so many and kill him? The arrow struck Antinous in the throat,\nand the point went clean through his neck, so that he fell over and the cup dropped from his hand, while a thick\nstream of blood gushed from his nostrils. He kicked the table from him and upset the things on it, so that the bread\nand roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on to the ground. The suitors were in an uproar when they saw\n328 The Odyssey\nthat a man had been hit; they sprang in dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked everywhere towards\nthe walls, but there was neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked Ulysses very angrily. \u201cStranger,\u201d said they, \u201cyou\nshall pay for shooting people in this way: om yi you shall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whom\nyou have slain was the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vultures shall devour you for having killed him.\u201d\nThus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by mistake, and did not perceive that death was\nhanging over the head of every one of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said:\n\u201cDogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have wasted my substance, have forced my\nwomen servants to lie with you, and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared neither Cod nor\nman, and now you shall die.\u201d\nThey turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round about to see whither he might fly for safe-\nty, but Eurymachus alone spoke.\n\u201cIf you are Ulysses,\u201d said he, \u201cthen what you have said is just. We have done much wrong on your lands and in\nyour house. But Antinous who was the head and front of the offending lies low already. It was all his doing. It was\nnot that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so much care about that; what he wanted was something quite\ndifferent, and Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill your son and to be chief man in Ithaca. Now,\ntherefore, that he has met the death which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make everything\ngood among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that we have eaten and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine\nworth twenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened. Until we have done\nthis no one can complain of your being enraged against us.\u201d\nUlysses again glared at him and said, \u201cThough you should give me all that you have in the world both now and\nall that you ever shall have, I will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must fight, or fly for your\nlives; and fly, not a man of you shall.\u201d\nTheir hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:\n\u201cMy friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where he is and shoot us down till he has killed ev-\nery man among us. Let us then show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield you from his arrows.\nLet us have at him with a rush, to drive him from the pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the\ntown, and raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting.\u201d\nAs he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides, and with a loud cry sprang towards\nUlysses, but Ulysses instantly shot an arrow into his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself in his liver.\nHe dropped his sword and fell doubled up over his table. The cup and all the meats went over on to the ground as\nhe smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of death, and he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were\nclosed in darkness.\nThen Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try and get him away from the door; but\nTelemachus was too quick for him, and struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and\nwent right through his chest, so that he fell heavily to the ground and struck the earth with his forehead. Then\nTelemachus sprang away from him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that if he stayed to draw it out,\nsome one of the Achaeans might come up and hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off at a\nrun, and immediately was at his father\u2019s side. Then he said:\n\u201cFather, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet for your temples. I will arm myself as well, and\nwill bring other armour for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed.\u201d\n\u201cRun and fetch them,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201cwhile my arrows hold out, or when I am alone they may get me away\nfrom the door.\u201d\nTelemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room where the armour was kept. He chose four\nshields, eight spears, and four brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to his father,\nand armed himself first, while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armour, and took their places\nnear Ulysses. Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the suitors one by one, and they\nfell thick on one another: when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by\nthe door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well\nwrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod\nspears.\nNow there was a trap door on the wall, while at one end of the pavement there was an exit leading to a narrow\npassage, and this exit was closed by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand by this door and guard it, for\nonly one person could attack it at a time. But Agelaus shouted out, \u201cCannot some one go up to the trap door and\ntell the people what is going on? Help would come at once, and we should soon make an end of this man and his\nshooting.\u201d\n\u201cThis may not be, Agelaus,\u201d answered Melanthius, \u201cthe mouth of the narrow passage is dangerously near the\nentrance to the outer court. One brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I will do, I\n329 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nwill bring you arms from the store room, for I am sure it is there that Ulysses and his son have put them.\u201d\nOn this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store room of Ulysses, house. There he chose\ntwelve shields, with as many helmets and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to give them to the suit-\nors. Ulysses\u2019 heart began to fail him when he saw the suitors putting on their armour and brandishing their spears.\nHe saw the greatness of the danger, and said to Telemachus, \u201cSome one of the women inside is helping the suitors\nagainst us, or it may be Melanthius.\u201d\nTelemachus answered, \u201cThe fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I left the store room door open, and they have\nkept a sharper look out than I have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the women who is\ndoing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius the son of Dolius.\u201d\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the store room to fetch more armour, but\nthe swineherd saw him and said to Ulysses who was beside him, \u201cUlysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that scoundrel\nMelanthius, just as we suspected, who is going to the store room. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him,\nor shall I bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many wrongs that he has done in your\nhouse?\u201d\nUlysses answered, \u201cTelemachus and I will hold these suitors in check, no matter what they do; go back both\nof you and bind Melanthius\u2019 hands and feet behind him. Throw him into the store room and make the door fast\nbehind you; then fasten a noose about his body, and string him close up to the rafters from a high bearing-post, that\nhe may linger on in an agony.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to the store room, which they entered before\nMelanthius saw them, for he was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, so the two took their\nstand on either side of the door and waited. By and by Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old\ndry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when he was young, but which had been long since\nthrown aside, and the straps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him back by the hair, and\nthrew him struggling to the ground. They bent his hands and feet well behind his back, and bound them tight with\na painful bond as Ulysses had told them; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him up from a high\npillar till he was close up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O swineherd Eumaeus, saying, \u201cMelan-\nthius, you will pass the night on a soft bed as you deserve. You will know very well when morning comes from the\nstreams of Oceanus, and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for the suitors to feast on.\u201d\nThere, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on their armour they closed the door behind\nthem and went back to take their places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the cloister, fierce\nand full of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the body of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove\u2019s\ndaughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw\nher and said, \u201cMentor, lend me your help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns he has done\nyou. Besides, you are my age-mate.\u201d\nBut all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from the other side raised an uproar when they saw\nher. Agelaus was the first to reproach her. \u201cMentor,\u201d he cried, \u201cdo not let Ulysses beguile you into siding with him\nand fighting the suitors. This is what we will do: when we have killed these people, father and son, we will kill you\ntoo. You shall pay for it with your head, and when we have killed you, we will take all you have, in doors or out, and\nbring it into hotch-pot with Ulysses\u2019 property; we will not let your sons live in your house, nor your daughters, nor\nshall your widow continue to live in the city of Ithaca.\u201d\nThis made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very angrily. \u201cUlysses,\u201d said she, \u201cyour strength\nand prowess are no longer what they were when you fought for nine long years among the Trojans about the noble\nlady Helen. You killed many a man in those days, and it was through your stratagem that Priam\u2019s city was taken.\nHow comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your own ground, face to face with the\nsuitors in your own house? Come on, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of Alcinous shall\nfight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him.\u201d\nBut she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still further to prove his own prowess and that of\nhis brave son, so she flew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in the form of a swallow.\nMeanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus, Pisander, and Polybus son of\nPolyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon the suitors\u2019 side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives they were\nby far the most valiant, for the others had already fallen under the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted to them and\nsaid, \u201cMy friends, he will soon have to leave off, for Mentor has gone away after having done nothing for him but\nbrag. They are standing at the doors unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw your spears\nfirst, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory by killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy\nabout the others.\u201d\nThey threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all of no effect. One hit the door post; anoth-\ner went against the door; the pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they had avoided all the spears\n330 The Odyssey\nof the suitors Ulysses said to his own men, \u201cMy friends, I should say we too had better let drive into the middle of\nthem, or they will crown all the harm they have done us by us outright.\u201d\nThey therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears. Ulysses killed Demoptolemus, Telema-\nchus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus, while the stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as the others drew\nback into a corner Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained their spears by drawing them from the bodies\nof the dead.\nThe suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their weapons for the most part without effect.\nOne hit a bearing-post of the cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft of another struck the\nwall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of the top skin from off Telemachus\u2019s wrist, and Ctesippus managed to\ngraze Eumaeus\u2019s shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell to the ground. Then Ulysses and his men\nlet drive into the crowd of suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus Polybus. After\nthis the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and taunted him saying, \u201cFoul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not\nbe so foolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your speech, for the gods are far stronger than\nmen. I make you a present of this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses when he was begging\nabout in his own house.\u201d\nThus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with a spear in close fight, while Telemachus\nhit Leocritus son of Evenor in the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell forward full on his face\nupon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat on the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the suitors\nquailed. They fled to the other end of the court like a herd of cattle maddened by the gadfly in early summer when\nthe days are at their longest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains swoop down on the\nsmaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground, and kill them, for they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on\nenjoy the sport \u2014 even so did Ulysses and his men fall upon the suitors and smite them on every side. They made a\nhorrible groaning as their brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with their blood.\nLeiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, \u201cUlysses I beseech you have mercy upon me and spare me.\nI never wronged any of the women in your house either in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others. I saw them,\nbut they would not listen, and now they are paying for their folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall\ndie without having done anything to deserve it, and shall have got no thanks for all the good that I did.\u201d\nUlysses looked sternly at him and answered, \u201cIf you were their sacrificing priest, you must have prayed many\na time that it might be long before I got home again, and that you might marry my wife and have children by her.\nTherefore you shall die.\u201d\nWith these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when he was being killed, and which was\nlying upon the ground. Then he struck Leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling in the dust while\nhe was yet speaking.\nThe minstrel Phemius son of Terpes\u2014he who had been forced by the suitors to sing to them\u2014now tried to save\nhis life. He was standing near towards the trap door, and held his lyre in his hand. He did not know whether to fly\nout of the cloister and sit down by the altar of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes and Ul-\nysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether to go straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees,\nbut in the end he deemed it best to embrace Ulysses\u2019 knees. So he laid his lyre on the ground the ground between\nthe mixing-bowl and the silver-studded seat; then going up to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said, \u201cUl-\nysses, I beseech you have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry for it afterwards if you kill a bard who can\nsing both for gods and men as I can. I make all my lays myself, and heaven visits me with every kind of inspiration.\nI would sing to you as though you were a god, do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. Your own son\nTelemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent your house and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they\nwere too many and too strong for me, so they made me.\u201d\nTelemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. \u201cHold!\u201d he cried, \u201cthe man is guiltless, do him no\nhurt; and we will Medon too, who was always good to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or Eumaeus has al-\nready killed him, or he has fallen in your way when you were raging about the court.\u201d\nMedon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a seat beneath which he had hidden by\ncovering himself up with a freshly flayed heifer\u2019s hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus, and laid\nhold of his knees.\n\u201cHere I am, my dear sir,\u201d said he, \u201cstay your hand therefore, and tell your father, or he will kill me in his rage\nagainst the suitors for having wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful to yourself.\u201d\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, \u201cFear not; Telemachus has saved your life, that you may know in future,\nand tell other people, how greatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore, outside the cloisters into\nthe outer court, and be out of the way of the slaughter\u2014you and the bard\u2014while I finish my work here inside.\u201d\nThe pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat down by Jove\u2019s great altar, looking fearfully\nround, and still expecting that they would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court carefully over, to see\n331 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nif anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living, but he found them all lying in the dust and weltering\nin their blood. They were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of the sea, and thrown upon the beach to lie\ngasping for water till the heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even so were the suitors lying all huddled up one\nagainst the other.\nThen Ulysses said to Telemachus, \u201cCall nurse Euryclea; I have something to say to her.\u201d\nTelemachus went and knocked at the door of the women\u2019s room. \u201cMake haste,\u201d said he, \u201cyou old woman who\nhave been set over all the other women in the house. Come outside; my father wishes to speak to you.\u201d\nWhen Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women\u2019s room and came out, following Telemachus.\nShe found Ulysses among the corpses bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring an\nox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so that he is a fearful sight; even so was Ulysses besmirched\nfrom head to foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of blood, she was beginning to cry\nout for joy, for she saw that a great deed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, \u201cOld woman,\u201d said he, \u201crejoice in\nsilence; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise about it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heav-\nen\u2019s doom and their own evil deeds have brought these men to destruction, for they respected no man in the whole\nworld, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a bad end as a punishment for their\nwickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me which of the women in the house have misconducted themselves, and\nwho are innocent.\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you the truth, my son,\u201d answered Euryclea. \u201cThere are fifty women in the house whom we teach to\ndo things, such as carding wool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all have misbehaved, and have\nbeen wanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope. They showed no disrespect to Telemachus, for he has only\nlately grown and his mother never permitted him to give orders to the female servants; but let me go upstairs and\ntell your wife all that has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cDo not wake her yet,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201cbut tell the women who have misconducted themselves to come to\nme.\u201d\nEuryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come to Ulysses; in the meantime he called Telema-\nchus, the stockman, and the swineherd. \u201cBegin,\u201d said he, \u201cto remove the dead, and make the women help you. Then,\nget sponges and clean water to swill down the tables and seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole\ncloisters, take the women into the space between the domed room and the wall of the outer court, and run them\nthrough with your swords till they are quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in which they used\nto lie in secret with the suitors.\u201d\nOn this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly. First they carried the dead bodies out,\nand propped them up against one another in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them do their\nwork quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. When they had done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats\nwith sponges and water, while Telemachus and the two others shovelled up the blood and dirt from the ground, and\nthe women carried it all away and put it out of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite clean and\norderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space between the wall of the domed room and\nthat of the yard, so that they could not get away: and Telemachus said to the other two, \u201cI shall not let these women\ndie a clean death, for they were insolent to me and my mother, and used to sleep with the suitors.\u201d\nSo saying he made a ship\u2019s cable fast to one of the bearing-posts that supported the roof of the domed room,\nand secured it all around the building, at a good height, lest any of the women\u2019s feet should touch the ground; and\nas thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their nest,\nand a terrible fate awaits them, even so did the women have to put their heads in nooses one after the other and die\nmost miserably. Their feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for very long.\nAs for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner court. There they cut off his nose and his\nears; they drew out his vitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut off his hands and his\nfeet.\nWhen they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back into the house, for all was now over;\nand Ulysses said to the dear old nurse Euryclea, \u201cBring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution, and fetch fire also\nthat I may burn it, and purify the cloisters. Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here with her attendants, and\nalso all the maid servants that are in the house.\u201d\n\u201cAll that you have said is true,\u201d answered Euryclea, \u201cbut let me bring you some clean clothes\u2014a shirt and cloak.\nDo not keep these rags on your back any longer. It is not right.\u201d\n\u201cFirst light me a fire,\u201d replied Ulysses.\nShe brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and Ulysses thoroughly purified the cloisters and both\nthe inner and outer courts. Then she went inside to call the women and tell them what had happened; whereon they\ncame from their apartment with torches in their hands, and pressed round Ulysses to embrace him, kissing his head\nand shoulders and taking hold of his hands. It made him feel as if he should like to weep, for he remembered every\n332 The Odyssey\none of them.\nBook XXIII\nEURYCLEA now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear husband had come home. Her aged\nknees became young again and her feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her head\nto speak to her. \u201cWake up Penelope, my dear child,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cand see with your own eyes something that you\nhave been wanting this long time past. Ulysses has at last indeed come home again, and has killed the suitors who\nwere giving so much trouble in his house, eating up his estate and ill-treating his son.\u201d\n\u201cMy good nurse,\u201d answered Penelope, \u201cyou must be mad. The gods sometimes send some very sensible people\nout of their minds, and make foolish people become sensible. This is what they must have been doing to you; for\nyou always used to be a reasonable person. Why should you thus mock me when I have trouble enough already\u2014\ntalking such nonsense, and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of my eyes and closed\nthem? I have never slept so soundly from the day my poor husband went to that city with the ill-omened name. Go\nback again into the women\u2019s room; if it had been any one else, who had woke me up to bring me such absurd news I\nshould have sent her away with a severe scolding. As it is, your age shall protect you.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear child,\u201d answered Euryclea, \u201cI am not mocking you. It is quite true as I tell you that Ulysses is come\nhome again. He was the stranger whom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister. Telemachus knew all the\ntime that he was come back, but kept his father\u2019s secret that he might have his revenge on all these wicked people.\nThen Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea, and wept for joy. \u201cBut my dear\nnurse,\u201d said she, \u201cexplain this to me; if he has really come home as you say, how did he manage to overcome the\nwicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always were?\u201d\n\u201cI was not there,\u201d answered Euryclea, \u201cand do not know; I only heard them groaning while they were being\nkilled. We sat crouching and huddled up in a corner of the women\u2019s room with the doors closed, till your son came\nto fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found Ulysses standing over the corpses that were lying on the\nground all round him, one on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you could have seen him standing there\nall bespattered with blood and filth, and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled up in the gate-\nhouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a great fire to purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to\ncall you, so come with me that you may both be happy together after all; for now at last the desire of your heart has\nbeen fulfilled; your husband is come home to find both wife and son alive and well, and to take his revenge in his\nown house on the suitors who behaved so badly to him.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019My dear nurse,\u201d said Penelope, \u201cdo not exult too confidently over all this. You know how delighted every one\nwould be to see Ulysses come home\u2014more particularly myself, and the son who has been born to both of us; but\nwhat you tell me cannot be really true. It is some god who is angry with the suitors for their great wickedness, and\nhas made an end of them; for they respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near\nthem, who came near them, and they have come to a bad end in consequence of their iniquity. Ulysses is dead far\naway from the Achaean land; he will never return home again.\u201d\nThen nurse Euryclea said, \u201cMy child, what are you talking about? but you were all hard of belief and have made\nup your mind that your husband is never coming, although he is in the house and by his own fire side at this very\nmoment. Besides I can give you another proof; when I was washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar\ngave him, and I wanted to tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not let me, and clapped his hands over my\nmouth; so come with me and I will make this bargain with you\u2014if I am deceiving you, you may have me killed by\nthe most cruel death you can think of.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear nurse,\u201d said Penelope, \u201chowever wise you may be you can hardly fathom the counsels of the gods.\nNevertheless, we will go in search of my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and the man who has killed\nthem.\u201d\nOn this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she considered whether she should keep at a\ndistance from her husband and question him, or whether she should at once go up to him and embrace him. When,\nhowever, she had crossed the stone floor of the cloister, she sat down opposite Ulysses by the fire, against the wall at\nright angles [to that by which she had entered], while Ulysses sat near one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the\nground, and waiting to see what his wife would say to him when she saw him. For a long time she sat silent and as\none lost in amazement. At one moment she looked him full in the face, but then again directly, she was misled by\nhis shabby clothes and failed to recognize him, till Telemachus began to reproach her and said:\n\u201cMother\u2014but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name\u2014why do you keep away from my father\nin this way? Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions? No other woman\ncould bear to keep away from her husband when he had come back to her after twenty years of absence, and after\nhaving gone through so much; but your heart always was as hard as a stone.\u201d\n333 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nPenelope answered, \u201cMy son, I am so lost in astonishment that I can find no words in which either to ask ques-\ntions or to answer them. I cannot even look him straight in the face. Still, if he really is Ulysses come back to his\nown home again, we shall get to understand one another better by and by, for there are tokens with which we two\nare alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all others.\u201d\nUlysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, \u201cLet your mother put me to any proof she likes; she will make\nup her mind about it presently. She rejects me for the moment and believes me to be somebody else, because I am\ncovered with dirt and have such bad clothes on; let us, however, consider what we had better do next. When one\nman has killed another, even though he was not one who would leave many friends to take up his quarrel, the man\nwho has killed him must still say good bye to his friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing the stay\nof a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you consider this matter.\u201d\n\u201cLook to it yourself, father,\u201d answered Telemachus, \u201cfor they say you are the wisest counsellor in the world, and\nthat there is no other mortal man who can compare with you. We will follow you with right good will, nor shall you\nfind us fail you in so far as our strength holds out.\u201d\n\u201cI will say what I think will be best,\u201d answered Ulysses. \u201cFirst wash and put your shirts on; tell the maids also to\ngo to their own room and dress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that if people outside hear,\nor any of the neighbours, or some one going along the street happens to notice it, they may think there is a wedding\nin the house, and no rumours about the death of the suitors will get about in the town, before we can escape to the\nwoods upon my own land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses heaven vouchsafes us shall seem wisest.\u201d\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed and put their shirts on, while the women\ngot ready. Then Phemius took his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The house re-\nechoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the people outside said, \u201cI suppose the queen has been\ngetting married at last. She ought to be ashamed of herself for not continuing to protect her husband\u2019s property\nuntil he comes home.\u201d\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had been happening. The upper servant Eu-\nrynome washed and anointed Ulysses in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made him\nlook taller and stronger than before; she also made the hair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in\ncurls like hyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders just as a skilful workman who has\nstudied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva\u2014and his work is full of beauty\u2014enriches a piece of silver plate\nby gilding it. He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals, and sat down opposite his wife on the seat\nhe had left. \u201cMy dear,\u201d said he, \u201cheaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever yet had.\nNo other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come back to her after twenty years of\nabsence, and after having gone through so much. But come, nurse, get a bed ready for me; I will sleep alone, for this\nwoman has a heart as hard as iron.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d answered Penelope, \u201cI have no wish to set myself up, nor to depreciate you; but I am not struck by\nyour appearance, for I very well remember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca. Neverthe-\nless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed chamber that he himself built. Bring the bed outside this room, and put\nbedding upon it with fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets.\u201d\nShe said this to try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said, \u201cWife, I am much displeased at what you have\njust been saying. Who has been taking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have found it a hard task,\nno matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some god came and helped him to shift it. There is no man living,\nhowever strong and in his prime, who could move it from its place, for it is a marvellous curiosity which I made\nwith my very own hands. There was a young olive growing within the precincts of the house, in full vigour, and\nabout as thick as a bearing-post. I built my room round this with strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them, and\nI made the doors strong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive tree and left the stump standing.\nThis I dressed roughly from the root upwards and then worked with carpenter\u2019s tools well and skilfully, straighten-\ning my work by drawing a line on the wood, and making it into a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the middle,\nand made it the centre-post of my bed, at which I worked till I had finished it, inlaying it with gold and silver; after\nthis I stretched a hide of crimson leather from one side of it to the other. So you see I know all about it, and I desire\nto learn whether it is still there, or whether any one has been removing it by cutting down the olive tree at its roots.\u201d\nWhen she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly broke down. She flew weeping to his side, flung\nher arms about his neck, and kissed him. \u201cDo not be angry with me Ulysses,\u201d she cried, \u201cyou, who are the wisest of\nmankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven has denied us the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing\nold, together; do not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did not embrace you thus as soon as I saw you. I have\nbeen shuddering all the time through fear that someone might come here and deceive me with a lying story; for\nthere are many very wicked people going about. Jove\u2019s daughter Helen would never have yielded herself to a man\nfrom a foreign country, if she had known that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and bring her back. Heav-\nen put it in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no thought to that sin, which has been the source of all our sorrows.\n334 The Odyssey\nNow, however, that you have convinced me by showing that you know all about our bed (which no human being\nhas ever seen but you and I and a single maid servant, the daughter of Actor, who was given me by my father on my\nmarriage, and who keeps the doors of our room) hard of belief though I have been I can mistrust no longer.\u201d\nThen Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and faithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of\nland is welcome to men who are swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their ship with the fury\nof his winds and waves\u2014a few alone reach the land, and these, covered with brine, are thankful when they find\nthemselves on firm ground and out of danger\u2014even so was her husband welcome to her as she looked upon him,\nand she could not tear her two fair arms from about his neck. Indeed they would have gone on indulging their sor-\nrow till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not Minerva determined otherwise, and held night back in the far west,\nwhile she would not suffer Dawn to leave Oceanus, nor to yoke the two steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear her\nonward to break the day upon mankind.\nAt last, however, Ulysses said, \u201cWife, we have not yet reached the end of our troubles. I have an unknown\namount of toil still to undergo. It is long and difficult, but I must go through with it, for thus the shade of Teiresias\nprophesied concerning me, on the day when I went down into Hades to ask about my return and that of my com-\npanions. But now let us go to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.\u201d\n\u201cYou shall go to bed as soon as you please,\u201d replied Penelope, \u201cnow that the gods have sent you home to your\nown good house and to your country. But as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it, tell me about the task\nthat lies before you. I shall have to hear about it later, so it is better that I should be told at once.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201cwhy should you press me to tell you? Still, I will not conceal it from you, though\nyou will not like it. I do not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide, carrying an oar, till I came to a\ncountry where the people have never heard of the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food. They know nothing\nabout ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He gave me this certain token which I will not hide from you.\nHe said that a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing shovel that I had on my shoulder.\nOn this, I was to fix my oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune; after which I was to\ngo home and offer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven, one after the other. As for myself, he said that death should\ncome to me from the sea, and that my life should ebb away very gently when I was full of years and peace of mind,\nand my people should bless me. All this, he said, should surely come to pass.\u201d\nAnd Penelope said, \u201cIf the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier time in your old age, you may hope then\nto have some respite from misfortune.\u201d\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches and made the bed ready with soft\ncoverlets; as soon as they had laid them, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest, leaving the bed cham-\nber woman Eurynome to show Ulysses and Penelope to bed by torch light. When she had conducted them to their\nroom she went back, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed. Telemachus, Philoetius, and the\nswineherd now left off dancing, and made the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep in the\ncloisters.\nWhen Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking with one another. She told him how much\nshe had had to bear in seeing the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so many sheep and\noxen on her account, and had drunk so many casks of wine. Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered, and\nhow much trouble he had himself given to other people. He told her everything, and she was so delighted to listen\nthat she never went to sleep till he had ended his whole story.\nHe began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached the fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He\ntold her all about the Cyclops and how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave comrades; how\nhe then went on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably and furthered him on his way, but even so he was not to\nreach home, for to his great grief a hurricane carried him out to sea again; how he went on to the Laestrygonian\ncity Telepylos, where the people destroyed all his ships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only. Then\nhe told of cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed to the chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost of the\nTheban prophet Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother who bore him and brought\nhim up when he was a child; how he then heard the wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on to the wandering\nrocks and terrible Charybdis and to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed in safety; how his men then ate the\ncattle of the sun-god, and how Jove therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts, so that all his men perished\ntogether, himself alone being left alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso, who kept\nhim there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted him to marry her, in which case she intended making him immortal\nso that he should never grow old, but she could not persuade him to let her do so; and how after much suffering\nhe had found his way to the Phaeacians, who had treated him as though he had been a god, and sent him back in\na ship to his own country after having given him gold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was the last\nthing about which he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows.\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that Ulysses had had both of his wife and of\n335 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nrepose, she bade gold-enthroned Dawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On this, Ul-\nysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope, \u201cWife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles,\nyou, here, in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home though I was longing all the time\nto do so. Now, however, that we have at last come together, take care of the property that is in the house. As for the\nsheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will take many myself by force from other people, and will\ncompel the Achaeans to make good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards. I am now going to the wooded\nlands out in the country to see my father who has so long been grieved on my account, and to yourself I will give\nthese instructions, though you have little need of them. At sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have been killing\nthe suitors; go upstairs, therefore, and stay there with your women. See nobody and ask no questions.\u201d\nAs he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus, and told them all\nto put on their armour also. This they did, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they opened the gates\nand sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now daylight, but Minerva nevertheless concealed them in dark-\nness and led them quickly out of the town.\nBook XXIV\nTHEN Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in his hand he held the fair golden wand\nwith which he seals men\u2019s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts and led\nthem, while they followed whining and gibbering behind him. As bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great\ncave, when one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even so did the ghosts whine and squeal\nas Mercury the healer of sorrow led them down into the dark abode of death. When they had passed the waters of\nOceanus and the rock Leucas, they came to the gates of the sun and the land of dreams, whereon they reached the\nmeadow of asphodel where dwell the souls and shadows of them that can labour no more.\nHere they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the\nfinest and handsomest man of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.\nThey gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing\nbitterly. Round him were gathered also the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of Aeisthus; and\nthe ghost of Achilles spoke first.\n\u201cSon of Atreus,\u201d it said, \u201cwe used to say that Jove had loved you better from first to last than any other hero, for\nyou were captain over many and brave men, when we were all fighting together before Troy; yet the hand of death,\nwhich no mortal can escape, was laid upon you all too early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the hey-day of\nyour renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound over your ashes, and your son would have been heir to\nyour good name, whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.\u201d\n\u201cHappy son of Peleus,\u201d answered the ghost of Agamemnon, \u201cfor having died at Troy far from Argos, while the\nbravest of the Trojans and the Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay in the whirling clouds\nof dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now of your chivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should we\never have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane to stay us. Then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the\nfray, we laid you on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments. The Danaans tore\ntheir hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother, when she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from\nout of the sea, and the sound of a great wailing went forth over the waters so that the Achaeans quaked for fear.\nThey would have fled panic-stricken to their ships had not wise old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest checked\nthem saying, \u2018Hold, Argives, fly not sons of the Achaeans, this is his mother coming from the sea with her immortal\nnymphs to view the body of her son.\u2019\n\u201cThus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of the old man of the sea stood round you\nweeping bitterly, and clothed you in immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their sweet voices in\nlament\u2014calling and answering one another; there was not an Argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted.\nDays and nights seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on the eighteenth day we gave you to\nthe flames, and many a fat sheep with many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt in raiment of\nthe gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes, horse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you\nwere burning, with the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of heaven had done their work, we gath-\nered your white bones at daybreak and laid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a golden\nvase to hold them\u2014gift of Bacchus, and work of Vulcan himself; in this we mingled your bleached bones with those\nof Patroclus who had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also those of Antilochus, who had been closer to\nyou than any other of your comrades now that Patroclus was no more.\n\u201cOver these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point jutting out over the open Hellespont, that it\nmight be seen from far out upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born hereafter. Your mother\nbegged prizes from the gods, and offered them to be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have\nbeen present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird themselves and make ready to contend for\n336 The Odyssey\nprizes on the death of some great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis offered in your\nhonour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives\nevermore among all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done? For Jove\nwilled my destruction on my return, by the hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.\u201d\nThus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with the ghosts of the suitors who had been\nkilled by Ulysses. The ghosts of Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to them at\nonce. The ghost of Agamemnon recognized Amphimedon son of Melaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had been his\nhost, so it began to talk to him.\n\u201cAmphimedon,\u201d it said, \u201cwhat has happened to all you fine young men\u2014all of an age too\u2014that you are come down\nhere under the ground? One could pick no finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds and waves\nagainst you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting\nor sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of their wives and city? Answer my question, for I have been your guest. Do\nyou not remember how I came to your house with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to join us with his ships against Troy? It\nwas a whole month ere we could resume our voyage, for we had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come with us.\u201d\nAnd the ghost of Amphimedon answered, \u201cAgamemnon, son of Atreus, king of men, I remember everything\nthat you have said, and will tell you fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about. Ulysses\nhad been long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did not say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet\nbring matters to an end, for she meant to compass our destruction: this, then, was the trick she played us. She set up\na great tambour frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. \u2018Sweethearts,\u2019 said\nshe, \u2018Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait\u2014for I would not have my skill\nin needlework perish unrecorded\u2014till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes, against the time when death\nshall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.\u2019 This is what she\nsaid, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon her great web all day long, but at night she would\nunpick the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years without our finding it out, but as\ntime wore on and she was now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished,\none of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she\nhad to finish it whether she would or no; and when she showed us the robe she had made, after she had had it\nwashed, its splendour was as that of the sun or moon.\n\u201cThen some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where his swineherd lives. Thither presently\ncame also his son, returning from a voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had hatched their\nplot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and then after him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulyss-\nes, clad in rags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He came so unexpectedly that\nnone of us knew him, not even the older ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured\nboth being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing\nJove inspired him, he and Telemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors behind\nthem. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated\nsuitors; and this was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string the bow\u2014nor nearly do so. When it\nwas about to reach the hands of Ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him, no matter what he\nmight say, but Telemachus insisted on his having it. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent\nhis arrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured his arrows on the ground, glaring\nfiercely about him. First he killed Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and\nthey fell thick on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was helping them, for they fell upon us with\nmight and main throughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as our brains were being bat-\ntered in, and the ground seethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and our bodies are\nlying still un-cared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends at home do not yet know what has happened, so that\nthey cannot lay us out and wash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according to the offices\ndue to the departed.\u201d\n\u201cHappy Ulysses, son of Laertes,\u201d replied the ghost of Agamemnon, \u201cyou are indeed blessed in the possession\nof a wife endowed with such rare excellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as Penelope the\ndaughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue shall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that\nshall be welcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope. How far otherwise was the wickedness of\nthe daughter of Tyndareus who killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men, for she has brought\ndisgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.\u201d\nThus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the bowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses\nand the others passed out of the town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes, which he had re-\nclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house, with a lean-to running all round it, where the slaves who worked\nfor him slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel woman, who looked after him in this his\ncountry-farm. When Ulysses got there, he said to his son and to the other two:\n337 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u201cGo to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner. Meanwhile I want to see whether my father\nwill know me, or fail to recognize me after so long an absence.\u201d\nHe then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius, who went straight on to the house, while\nhe turned off into the vineyard to make trial of his father. As he went down into the great orchard, he did not see\nDolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the\nvineyard, at the place where the old man had told them; he therefore found his father alone, hoeing a vine. He had\non a dirty old shirt, patched and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him from\nthe brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-be-\ngone. When Ulysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall pear tree and began to\nweep. He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his having come home, or whether he\nshould first question him and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him, so in this\nmind he went up to his father, who was bending down and digging about a plant.\n\u201cI see, sir,\u201d said Ulysses, \u201cthat you are an excellent gardener\u2014what pains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a\nsingle plant, not a fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of your attention. I trust, however, that\nyou will not be offended if I say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself. You are old, unsavoury, and\nvery meanly clad. It cannot be because you are idle that your master takes such poor care of you, indeed your face and\nfigure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim you of noble birth. I should have said that you were one of\nthose who should wash well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have a right to do; but tell me, and tell me true,\nwhose bondman are you, and in whose garden are you working? Tell me also about another matter. Is this place that I\nhave come to really Ithaca? I met a man just now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience to hear\nmy story out when I was asking him about an old friend of mine, whether he was still living, or was already dead and\nin the house of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my house once when I was in my own country\nand never yet did any stranger come to me whom I liked better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his\nfather was Laertes, son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundance of my house,\nand when he went away I gave him all customary presents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid\nsilver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces of tapestry; I also gave him twelve\ncloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. To all this I added four good look-\ning women skilled in all useful arts, and I let him take his choice.\u201d\nHis father shed tears and answered, \u201cSir, you have indeed come to the country that you have named, but it is\nfallen into the hands of wicked people. All this wealth of presents has been given to no purpose. If you could have\nfound your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would have entertained you hospitably and would have required your\npresents amply when you left him\u2014as would have been only right considering what you have already given him.\nBut tell me, and tell me true, how many years is it since you entertained this guest\u2014my unhappy son, as ever was?\nAlas! He has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the\nbirds and wild beasts of some continent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, who were his parents, could throw our\narms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her\nhusband as was natural upon his death bed, and close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed. But now,\ntell me truly for I want to know. Who and whence are you\u2014tell me of your town and parents? Where is the ship\nlying that has brought you and your men to Ithaca? Or were you a passenger on some other man\u2019s ship, and those\nwho brought you here have gone on their way and left you?\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you everything,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201cquite truly. I come from Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am\nson of king Apheidas, who is the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off my course as I\nwas leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here against my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the open\ncountry outside the town, and this is the fifth year since Ulysses left my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were\ngood for him when he left me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and I rejoiced to see them as we\nparted, for we had every hope that we should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents.\u201d\nA dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both hands with the dust from off the ground\nand poured it over his grey head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched, and his nostrils\nquivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him,\nsaying, \u201cI am he, father, about whom you are asking\u2014I have returned after having been away for twenty years. But\ncease your sighing and lamentation\u2014we have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing the suit-\nors in my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes.\u201d\n\u201cIf you really are my son Ulysses,\u201d replied Laertes, \u201cand have come back again, you must give me such manifest\nproof of your identity as shall convince me.\u201d\n\u201cFirst observe this scar,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201cwhich I got from a boar\u2019s tusk when I was hunting on Mount Par-\nnassus. You and my mother had sent me to Autolycus, my mother\u2019s father, to receive the presents which when he\nwas over here he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will point out to you the trees in the vineyard which you\n338 The Odyssey\ngave me, and I asked you all about them as I followed you round the garden. We went over them all, and you told\nme their names and what they all were. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty fig trees; you also\nsaid you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn planted between each row, and they yield grapes of every\nkind when the heat of heaven has been laid heavy upon them.\u201d\nLaertes\u2019 strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which his son had given him. He threw his\narms about him, and Ulysses had to support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as he came\nto, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, \u201cO father Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if\nthe suitors have really been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless, I am much afraid that I shall have\nall the townspeople of Ithaca up here directly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the\ncities of the Cephallenians.\u201d\nUlysses answered, \u201cTake heart and do not trouble yourself about that, but let us go into the house hard by your gar-\nden. I have already told Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready as soon as possible.\u201d\nThus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they got there they found Telemachus with\nthe stockman and the swineherd cutting up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took\nLaertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up to\nhim and gave him a more imposing presence, making him taller and stouter than before. When he came back his\nson was surprised to see him looking so like an immortal, and said to him, \u201cMy dear father, some one of the gods\nhas been making you much taller and better-looking.\u201d\nLaertes answered, \u201cWould, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I were the man I was when I ruled among\nthe Cephallenians, and took Nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what I then was and had\nbeen in our house yesterday with my armour on, I should have been able to stand by you and help you against the\nsuitors. I should have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced to see it.\u201d\nThus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, left off\nworking, and took each his proper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by and by old Dolius\nand his sons left their work and came up, for their mother, the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he\nwas growing old, had been to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were certain it was he, they stood there lost\nin astonishment; but Ulysses scolded them good-naturedly and said, \u201cSit down to your dinner, old man, and never\nmind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for some time and have been waiting for you.\u201d\nThen Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. \u201cSir,\u201d said he, seizing his master\u2019s hand and kissing\nit at the wrist, \u201cwe have long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after we had given up\nhoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper you. But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return,\nor shall we send some one to tell her?\u201d\n\u201cOld man,\u201d answered Ulysses, \u201cshe knows already, so you need not trouble about that.\u201d On this he took his seat,\nand the sons of Dolius gathered round Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one after the other; then they\ntook their seats in due order near Dolius their father.\nWhile they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went round the town, and noised abroad the\nterrible fate that had befallen the suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered from every\nquarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses. They took the dead away, buried every man his own,\nand put the bodies of those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the fishermen to take each of\nthem to his own place. They then met angrily in the place of assembly, and when they were got together Eupeithes\nrose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death of his son Antinous, who had been the first man killed\nby Ulysses, so he said, weeping bitterly, \u201cMy friend, this man has done the Achaeans great wrong. He took many of\nour best men away with him in his fleet, and he has lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has\nbeen killing all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and doing before he can get away to Pylos or\nto Elis where the Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an everlasting disgrace\nto us if we do not avenge the murder of our sons and brothers. For my own part I should have no mote pleasure in life,\nbut had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after them, before they can cross over to the mainland.\u201d\nHe wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard Phemius had now woke up, and came to\nthem from the house of Ulysses. Every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle of the assem-\nbly, and Medon said, \u201cHear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did not do these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw\nan immortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god appeared, now in front of him encouraging\nhim, and now going furiously about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on one another.\u201d\nOn this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of Mastor, rose to speak, for he was the only man\namong them who knew both past and future; so he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying,\n\u201cMen of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as they have; you would not listen to me, nor\nyet to Mentor, when we bade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the wantonness of their\nhearts\u2014wasting the substance and dishonouring the wife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now,\n339 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nhowever, let it be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out against Ulysses, or you may find that you have been draw-\ning down evil on your own heads.\u201d\nThis was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at once left the assembly. But the rest stayed\nwhere they were, for the speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes; they therefore hurried\noff for their armour, and when they had armed themselves, they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes led\nthem on in their folly. He thought he was going to avenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he was never to\nreturn, but was himself to perish in his attempt.\nThen Minerva said to Jove, \u201cFather, son of Saturn, king of kings, answer me this question\u2014What do you propose\nto do? Will you set them fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?\u201d\nAnd Jove answered, \u201cMy child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your own arrangement that Ulysses came\nhome and took his revenge upon the suitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will be most rea-\nsonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall\ncontinue to rule, while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre of their sons and brothers. Let them then\nall become friends as heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign.\u201d\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she darted from off the topmost summits of\nOlympus.\nNow when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by saying, \u201cSome of you go out and see if they\nare not getting close up to us.\u201d So one of Dolius\u2019s sons went as he was bid.

But Ulysses gave a\ngreat cry, and gathering himself together swooped down like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunder-\nbolt of fire that fell just in front of Minerva, so she said to Ulysses, \u201cUlysses, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful\nstrife, or Jove will be angry with you.\u201d\nThus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly.

(The Chorus enters. The following lines between the\nNurse, Chorus, and Medea are sung.)\nChorus\nI heard the voice, uplifted loud, of our poor Colchian lady, nor yet is she quiet; speak, aged dame, for as I stood\nby the house with double gates I heard a voice of weeping from within, and I do grieve, lady, for the sorrows of this\nhouse, for it hath won my love.\nNurse\n\u2018Tis a house no more; all that is passed away long since; a royal bride keeps Jason at her side, while our mistress\npines away in her bower, finding no comfort for her soul in aught her friends can say.\nMedeA\n(within) Oh, oh!

(As the Chorus\nfinishes its song, Medea enters from the house.)\nMedeA\nFrom the house I have come forth, Corinthian ladies, for fear lest you be blaming me; for well I know that\namongst men many by showing pride have gotten them an ill name and a reputation for indifference, both those\nwho shun men\u2019s gaze and those who move amid the stranger crowd, and likewise they who choose a quiet walk in\nlife. For there is no just discernment in the eyes of men, for they, or ever they have surely learnt their neighbour\u2019s\nheart, loathe him at first sight, though never wronged by him; and so a stranger most of all should adopt a city\u2019s\nviews; nor do I commend that citizen, who, in the stubbornness of his heart, from churlishness resents the city\u2019s\nwill. But on me hath fallen this unforeseen disaster, and sapped my life; ruined I am, and long to resign the boon\nof existence, kind friends, and die. For he who was all the world to me, as well thou knowest, hath turned out the\nworst of men, my own husband. Of all things that have life and sense we women are the most hapless creatures;\nfirst must we buy a husband at a great price, and o\u2019er ourselves a tyrant set which is an evil worse than the first; and\nherein lies the most important issue, whether our choice be good or bad. For divorce is not honourable to women,\nnor can we disown our lords. Next must the wife, coming as she does to ways and customs new, since she hath not\nlearnt the lesson in her home, have a diviner\u2019s eye to see how best to treat the partner of her life. If haply we perform\n344 Medea\nthese tasks with thoroughness and tact, and the husband live with us, without resenting the yoke, our life is a happy\none; if not, \u2018twere best to die. But when a man is vexed with what he finds indoors, he goeth forth and rids his soul\nof its disgust, betaking him to some friend or comrade of like age; whilst we must needs regard his single self. And\nyet they say we live secure at home, while they are at the wars, with their sorry reasoning, for I would gladly take\nmy stand in battle array three times o\u2019er, than once give birth. But enough! this language suits not thee as it does\nme; thou hast a city here, a father\u2019s house, some joy in life, and friends to share thy thoughts, but I am destitute,\nwithout a city, and therefore scorned by my husband, a captive I from a foreign shore, with no mother, brother, or\nkinsman in whom to find a new haven of refuge from this calamity. Wherefore this one boon and only this I wish\nto win from thee,-thy silence, if haply I can some way or means devise to avenge me on my husband for this cruel\ntreatment, and on the man who gave to him his daughter, and on her who is his wife. For though woman be timo-\nrous enough in all else, and as regards courage, a coward at the mere sight of steel, yet in the moment she finds her\nhonour wronged, no heart is filled with deadlier thoughts than hers.\nLeAder of the Chorus\nThis will I do; for thou wilt be taking a just vengeance on thy husband, Medea. That thou shouldst mourn thy\nlot surprises me not. But lo! I see Creon, king of this land coming hither, to announce some new resolve. (Creon\nenters, with his retinue.)\nCreoN\nHark thee, Medea, I bid thee take those sullen looks and angry thoughts against thy husband forth from this\nland in exile, and with thee take both thy children and that without delay, for I am judge in this sentence, and I will\nnot return unto my house till I banish thee beyond the borders of the land.\nMedeA\nAh, me! now is utter destruction come upon me, unhappy that I am! For my enemies are bearing down on me\nfull sail, nor have I any landing-place to come at in my trouble. Yet for all my wretched plight I will ask thee, Creon,\nwherefore dost thou drive me from the land?\nCreoN\nI fear thee,-no longer need I veil my dread \u2018neath words,-lest thou devise against my child some cureless ill.\nMany things contribute to this fear of mine; thou art a witch by nature, expert in countless sorceries, and thou art\nchafing for the loss of thy husband\u2019s affection. I hear, too, so they tell me, that thou dost threaten the father of the\nbride, her husband, and herself with some mischief; wherefore I will take precautions ere our troubles come. For \u2018tis\nbetter for me to incur thy hatred now, lady, than to soften my heart and bitterly repent it hereafter.\nMedeA\nAlas! this is not now the first time, but oft before, O Creon, hath my reputation injured me and caused sore\nmischief. Wherefore whoso is wise in his generation ought never to have his children taught to be too clever; for\nbesides the reputation they get for idleness, they purchase bitter odium from the citizens. For if thou shouldst\nimport new learning amongst dullards, thou wilt be thought a useless trifler, void of knowledge; while if thy fame\nin the city o\u2019ertops that of the pretenders to cunning knowledge, thou wilt win their dislike. I too myself share in\nthis ill-luck. Some think me clever and hate me, others say I am too reserved, and some the very reverse; others find\nme hard to please and not so very clever after all. Be that as it may, thou dost fear me lest I bring on thee something\nto mar thy harmony. Fear me not, Creon, my position scarce is such that should seek to quarrel with princes. Why\nshould I, for how hast thou injured me? Thou hast betrothed thy daughter where thy fancy prompted thee. No, \u2018tis\nmy husband I hate, though I doubt not thou hast acted wisely herein. And now I grudge not thy prosperity; betroth\nthy child, good luck to thee, but let me abide in this land, for though I have been wronged I will be still and yield to\nmy superiors.\nCreoN\nThy words are soft to hear, but much I dread lest thou art devising some mischief in thy heart, and less than\never do I trust thee now; for cunning woman, and man likewise, is easier to guard against when quick-tempered\nthan when taciturn. Nay, begone at once! speak me no speeches, for this is decreed, nor hast thou any art whereby\nthou shalt abide amongst us, since thou hatest me.\n345 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nMedeA\nO, say not so! by thy knees and by thy daughter newlywed, I do implore!\nCreoN\nThou wastest words; thou wilt never persuade me.\nMedeA\nWhat, wilt thou banish me, and to my prayers no pity yield?\nCreoN\nI will, for I love not thee above my own family.\nMedeA\nO my country! what fond memories I have of thee in this hour!\nCreoN\nYea, for I myself love my city best of all things save my children.\nMedeA\nAh me! ah me! to mortal man how dread a scourge is love!\nCreoN\nThat, I deem, is according to the turn our fortunes take.\nMedeA\nO Zeus! let not the author of these my troubles escape thee.\nCreoN\nBegone, thou silly woman, and free me from my toil.\nMedeA\nThe toil is mine, no lack of it.\nCreoN\nSoon wilt thou be thrust out forcibly by the hand of servants.\nMedeA\nNot that, not that, I do entreat thee, Creon\nCreoN\nThou wilt cause disturbance yet, it seems.\nMedeA\nI will begone; I ask thee not this boon to grant.\nCreoN\nWhy then this violence? why dost thou not depart?\nMedeA\nSuffer me to abide this single day and devise some plan for the manner of my exile, and means of living for my\nchildren, since their father cares not to provide his babes therewith. Then pity them; thou too hast children of thine\nown; thou needs must have a kindly heart. For my own lot I care naught, though I an exile am, but for those babes I\nweep, that they should learn what sorrow means.\n346 Medea\nCreoN\nMine is a nature anything but harsh; full oft by showing pity have suffered shipwreck; and now albeit I clearly see\nmy error, yet shalt thou gain this request, lady; but I do forewarn thee, if tomorrow\u2019s rising sun shall find thee and thy\nchildren within the borders of this land, thou diest; my word is spoken and it will not lie. So now, if abide thou must,\nstay this one day only, for in it thou canst not do any of the fearful deeds I dread. (Creon and his retinue go out.)\nChorus\n(chanting) Ah! poor lady, woe is thee! Alas, for thy sorrows! Whither wilt thou turn? What protection, what\nhome or country to save thee from thy troubles wilt thou find? O Medea, in what a hopeless sea of misery heaven\nhath plunged thee!\nMedeA\nOn all sides sorrow pens me in. Who shall gainsay this? But all is not yet lost! think not so. Still are there trou-\nbles in store for the new bride, and for her bridegroom no light toil. Dost think I would ever have fawned on yonder\nman, unless to gain some end or form some scheme? Nay, would not so much as have spoken to him or touched\nhim with my hand. But he has in folly so far stepped in that, though he might have checked my plot by banishing\nme from the land, he hath allowed me to abide this day, in which I will lay low in death three of my enemies-a\nfather and his daughter and my husband too. Now, though I have many ways to compass their death, I am not sure,\nfriends, which I am to try first. Shall I set fire to the bridal mansion, or plunge the whetted sword through their\nhearts, softly stealing into the chamber where their couch is spread? One thing stands in my way. If I am caught\nmaking my way into the chamber, intent on my design, I shall be put to death and cause my foes to mock, \u2018Twere\nbest to take the shortest way-the way we women are most skilled in-by poison to destroy them. Well, suppose them\ndead; what city will receive me? What friendly host will give me a shelter in his land, a home secure, and save my\nsoul alive? None. So I will wait yet a little while in case some tower of defence rise up for me; then will I proceed\nto this bloody deed in crafty silence; but if some unexpected mischance drive me forth, I will with mine own hand\nseize the sword, e\u2019en though I die for it, and slay them, and go forth on my bold path of daring. By that dread queen\nwhom I revere before all others and have chosen to share my task, by Hecate who dwells within my inmost cham-\nber, not one of them shall wound my heart and rue it not. Bitter and sad will I make their marriage for them; bitter\nshall be the wooing of it, bitter my exile from the land. Up, then, Medea, spare not the secrets of thy art in plotting\nand devising; on to the danger. Now comes a struggle needing courage. Dost see what thou art suffering? \u2018Tis not\nfor thee to be a laughing-stock to the race of Sisyphus by reason of this wedding of Jason, sprung, as thou art, from\nnoble sire, and of the Sun-god\u2019s race. Thou hast cunning; and, more than this, we women, though by nature little apt\nfor virtuous deeds, are most expert to fashion any mischief.\nChorus\n(singing, strophe 1)\nBack to their source the holy rivers turn their tide. Order and the universe are being reversed. \u2018Tis men whose\ncounsels are treacherous, whose oath by heaven is no longer sure. Rumour shall bring a change o\u2019er my life, bringing\nit into good repute. Honour\u2019s dawn is breaking for woman\u2019s sex; no more shall the foul tongue of slander fix upon\nus.\n(antistrophe 1)\nThe songs of the poets of old shall cease to make our faithlessness their theme. Phoebus, lord of minstrelsy, hath\nnot implanted in our mind the gift of heavenly song, else had I sung an answering strain to the race of males, for\ntime\u2019s long chapter affords many a theme on their sex as well as ours.\n(strophe 2)\nWith mind distraught didst thou thy father\u2019s house desert on thy voyage betwixt ocean\u2019s twin rocks, and on\na foreign strand thou dwellest thy bed left husbandless, poor lady, and thou an exile from the land, dishonoured,\npersecuted.\n(antistrophe 2)\n347 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nGone is the grace that oaths once had. Through all the breadth of Hellas honour is found no more; to heaven\nhath it sped away. For thee no father\u2019s house is open, woe is thee! to be a haven from the troublous storm, while\no\u2019er thy home is set another queen, the bride that is preferred to thee. (As the Chorus finishes its song, Jason enters,\nalone. Medea comes out of the house.)\nJAsoN\nIt is not now I first remark, but oft ere this, how unruly a pest is a harsh temper. For instance, thou, hadst thou\nbut patiently endured the will of thy superiors, mightest have remained here in this land and house, but now for\nthy idle words wilt thou be banished. Thy words are naught to me. Cease not to call Jason basest of men; but for\nthose words thou hast spoken against our rulers, count it all gain that exile is thy only punishment. I ever tried to\ncheck the outbursts of the angry monarch, and would have had thee stay, but thou wouldst not forego thy silly rage,\nalways reviling our rulers, and so thou wilt be banished. Yet even after all this I weary not of my goodwill, but am\ncome with thus much forethought, lady, that thou mayst not be destitute nor want for aught, when, with thy sons,\nthou art cast out. Many an evil doth exile bring in its train with it; for even though thou hatest me, never will I har-\nbour hard thoughts of thee.\nMedeA\nThou craven villain (for that is the only name my tongue can find for thee, a foul reproach on thy unmanliness),\ncomest thou to me, thou, most hated foe of gods, of me, and of all mankind? \u2018Tis no proof of courage or hardihood\nto confront thy friends after injuring them, but that worst of all human diseases-loss of shame. Yet hast thou done\nwell to come; for I shall ease my soul by reviling thee, and thou wilt be vexed at my recital. I will begin at the very\nbeginning. I saved thy life, as every Hellene knows who sailed with thee aboard the good ship Argo, when thou wert\nsent to tame and yoke fire-breathing bulls, and to sow the deadly tilth. Yea, and I slew the dragon which guarded\nthe golden fleece, keeping sleepless watch o\u2019er it with many a wreathed coil, and I raised for thee a beacon of de-\nliverance. Father and home of my free will I left and came with the to Iolcos, \u2018neath Pelion\u2019s hills, for my love was\nstronger than my prudence. Next I caused the death of Pelias by a doom most grievous, even by his own children\u2019s\nhand, beguiling them of all their fear. All this have I done for thee, thou traitor! and thou hast cast me over, taking\nto thyself another wife, though children have been born to us. Hadst thou been childless still, I could have pardoned\nthy desire for this new union. Gone is now the trust I put in oaths. I cannot even understand whether thou thinkest\nthat the gods of old no longer rule, or that fresh decrees are now in vogue amongst mankind, for thy conscience\nmust tell thee thou hast not kept faith with me. Ah! poor right hand, which thou didst often grasp. These knees\nthou didst embrace! All in vain, I suffered a traitor to touch me! How short of my hopes I am fallen! But come, I\nwill deal with the as though thou wert my friend. Yet what kindness can I expect from one so base as thee? But yet\nI will do it, for my questioning will show thee yet more base. Whither can I turn me now? to my father\u2019s house, to\nmy own country, which I for thee deserted to come hither? to the hapless daughters of Pelias? A glad welcome, I\ntrow, would they give me in their home, whose father\u2019s death I compassed! My case stands even thus: I am become\nthe bitter foe to those of mine own home, and those whom I need ne\u2019er have wronged I have made mine enemies to\npleasure thee. Wherefore to reward me for this thou hast made me doubly blest in the eyes of many wife in Hellas;\nand in thee I own a peerless, trusty lord. O woe is me, if indeed I am to be cast forth an exile from the land, without\none friend; one lone woman with her babes forlorn! Yea, a fine reproach to thee in thy bridal hour, that thy children\nand the wife who saved thy life are beggars and vagabonds! O Zeus! why hast thou granted unto man clear signs to\nknow the sham in gold, while on man\u2019s brow no brand is stamped whereby to gauge the villain\u2019s heart?\nLeAder of the Chorus\nThere is a something terrible and past all cure, when quarrels arise \u2018twixt those who are near and dear.\nJAsoN\nNeeds must I now, it seems, turn orator, and, like a good helmsman on a ship with close-reefed sails, weather\nthat wearisome tongue of thine. Now, I believe, since thou wilt exaggerate thy favours, that to Cypri, alone of gods\nor men I owe the safety of my voyage. Thou hast a subtle wit enough; yet were it a hateful thing for me to say that\nthe Love-god constrained thee by his resistless shaft to save my life. However, I will not reckon this too nicely; \u2018twas\nkindly done, however thou didst serve me. Yet for my safety hast thou received more than ever thou gavest, as I\nwill show. First, thou dwellest in Hellas, instead of thy barbarian land, and hast learnt what justice means and how\nto live by law, not by the dictates of brute force; and all the Hellenes recognize thy cleverness, and thou hast gained\na name; whereas, if thou hadst dwelt upon the confines of the earth, no tongue had mentioned thee. Give me no\ngold within my halls, nor skill to sing a fairer strain than ever Orpheus sang, unless there-with my fame be spread\n348 Medea\nabroad! So much I say to thee about my own toils, for \u2018twas thou didst challenge me to this retort. As for the taunts\nthou urgest against my marriage with the princess, I will prove to thee, first, that I am prudent herein, next chas-\ntened in my love, and last powerful friend to thee and to thy sons; only hold thy peace. Since I have here withdrawn\nfrom Iolcos with many a hopeless trouble at my back, what happier device could I, an exile, frame than marriage\nwith the daughter of the king? \u2018Tis not because I loathe thee for my wife-the thought that rankles in thy heart; \u2018tis\nnot because I am smitten with desire for a new bride, nor yet that I am eager to vie with others in begetting many\nchildren, for those we have are quite enough, and I do not complain. Nay, \u2018tis that we-and this is most import-\nant-may dwell in comfort, instead of suffering want (for well I know that every whilom friend avoids the poor), and\nthat I might rear my sons as doth befit my house; further, that I might be the father of brothers for the children thou\nhast borne, and raise these to the same high rank, uniting the family in one,-to my lasting bliss. Thou, indeed, hast\nno need of more children, but me it profits to help my present family by that which is to be. Have I miscarried here?\nNot even thou wouldest say so unless a rival\u2019s charms rankled in thy bosom. No, but you women have such strange\nideas, that you think all is well so long as your married life runs smooth; but if some mischance occur to ruffle your\nlove, all that was good and lovely erst you reckon as your foes. Yea, men should have begotten children from some\nother source, no female race existing; thus would no evil ever have fallen on mankind.\nLeAder\nThis speech, O Jason, hast thou with specious art arranged; but yet I think-albeit in speaking I am indis-\ncreet-that thou hast sinned in thy betrayal of thy wife.\nMedeA\nNo doubt I differ from the mass of men on many points; for, to my mind, whoso hath skill to fence with words\nin an unjust cause, incurs the heaviest penalty; for such an one, confident that he can cast a decent veil of words\no\u2019er his injustice, dares to practise it; and yet he is not so very clever after all. So do not thou put forth thy specious\npleas and clever words to me now, for one word of mine will lay thee low. Hadst thou not had a villain\u2019s heart, thou\nshouldst have gained my consent, then made this match, instead of hiding it from those who loved thee.\nJAsoN\nThou wouldest have lent me ready aid, no doubt, in this proposal, if had told thee of my marriage, seeing that\nnot even now canst thou restrain thy soul\u2019s hot fury.\nMedeA\nThis was not what restrained thee; but thine eye was turned towards old age, and a foreign wife began to appear\na shame to thee.\nJAsoN\nBe well assured of this: \u2018twas not for the woman\u2019s sake I wedded the king\u2019s daughter, my present wife; but, as I\nhave already told thee, I wished to insure thy safety and to be the father of royal sons bound by blood to my own\nchildren-a bulwark to our house.\nMedeA\nMay that prosperity, whose end is woe, ne\u2019er be mine, nor such wealth as would ever sting my heart!\nJAsoN\nChange that prayer as I will teach thee, and thou wilt show more wisdom. Never let happiness appear in sor-\nrow\u2019s guise, nor, when thy fortune smiles, pretend she frowns!\nMedeA\nMock on; thou hast a place of refuge; I am alone, an exile soon to be.\nJAsoN\nThy own free choice was this; blame no one else.\nMedeA\nWhat did I do? Marry, then betray thee?\n349 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nJAsoN\nAgainst the king thou didst invoke an impious curse.\nMedeA\nOn thy house too maybe I bring the curse.\nJAsoN\nKnow this, I will no further dispute this point with thee. But, if thou wilt of my fortune somewhat take for the\nchildren or thyself to help thy exile, say on; for I am ready to grant it with ungrudging hand, yea and to bend tokens\nto my friends elsewhere who shall treat thee well. If thou refuse this offer, thou wilt do a foolish deed, but if thou\ncease from anger the greater will be thy gain.\nMedeA\nI will have naught to do with friends of thine, naught will I receive of thee, offer it not to me; a villain\u2019s gifts can\nbring no blessing.\nJAsoN\nAt least I call the gods to witness, that I am ready in all things to serve thee and thy children, but thou dost\nscorn my favours and thrustest thy friends stubbornly away; wherefore thy lot will be more bitter still.\nMedeA\nAway! By love for thy young bride entrapped, too long thou lingerest outside her chamber; go wed, for, if God\nwill, thou shalt have such a marriage as thou wouldst fain refuse. (Jason goes out.)\nChorus\n(singing, strophe 1)\nWhen in excess and past all limits Love doth come, he brings not glory or repute to man; but if the Cyprian\nqueen in moderate might approach, no goddess is so full of charm as she. Never, O never, lady mine, discharge at\nme from thy golden bow a shaft invincible, in passion\u2019s venom dipped.\n(antistrophe 1)\nOn me may chastity, heaven\u2019s fairest gift, look with a favouring eye; never may Cypris, goddess dread, fasten on\nme a temper to dispute, or restless jealousy, smiting my soul with mad desire for unlawful love, but may she hallow\npeaceful married life and shrewdly decide whom each of us shall wed.\n(strophe 2)\nO my country, O my own dear home! God grant I may never be an outcast from my city, leading that cruel\nhelpless life, whose every day is misery. Ere that may I this life complete and yield to death, ay, death; for there is no\nmisery that doth surpass the loss of fatherland.\n(antistrophe 2)\nI have seen with mine eyes, nor from the lips of others have I the lesson learnt; no city, not one friend doth pity\nthee in this thine awful woe. May he perish and find no favour, whoso hath not in him honour for his friends, freely\nunlocking his heart to them. Never shall he be friend of mine. (Medea has been seated in despair on her door-step\nduring the choral song. Aegeus and his attendants enter.)\nAegeus\nAll hail, Medea! no man knoweth fairer prelude to the greeting of friends than this.\nMedeA\nAll hail to thee likewise, Aegeus, son of wise Pandion. Whence comest thou to this land?\n350 Medea\nAegeus\nFrom Phoebus\u2019 ancient oracle.\nMedeA\nWhat took thee on thy travels to the prophetic centre of the earth?\nAegeus\nThe wish to ask how I might raise up seed unto myself.\nMedeA\nPray tell me, hast thou till now dragged on a childless life?\nAegeus\nI have no child owing to the visitation of some god.\nMedeA\nHast thou a wife, or hast thou never known the married state?\nAegeus\nI have a wife joined to me in wedlock\u2019s bond.\nMedeA\nWhat said Phoebus to thee as to children?\nAegeus\nWords too subtle for man to comprehend.\nMedeA\nSurely I may learn the god\u2019s answer?\nAegeus\nMost assuredly, for it is just thy subtle wit it needs.\nMedeA\nWhat said the god? speak, if I may hear it.\nAegeus\nHe bade me \u201cnot loose the wineskin\u2019s pendent neck.\u201d\nMedeA\nTill when? what must thou do first, what country visit?\nAegeus\nTill I to my native home return.\nMedeA\nWhat object hast thou in sailing to this land?\nAegeus\nO\u2019er Troezen\u2019s realm is Pittheus king.\nMedeA\nPelops\u2019 son, a man devout they say.\n351 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAegeus\nTo him I fain would impart the oracle of the god.\nMedeA\nThe man is shrewd and versed in such-like lore.\nAegeus\nAye, and to me the dearest of all my warrior friends.\nMedeA\nGood luck to thee! success to all thy wishes!\nAegeus\nBut why that downcast eye, that wasted cheek?\nMedeA\nO Aegeus, my husband has proved most evil.\nAegeus\nWhat meanest thou? explain to me clearly the cause of thy despondency.\nMedeA\nJason is wronging me though I have given him no cause.\nAegeus\nWhat hath he done? tell me more clearly.\nMedeA\nHe is taking another wife to succeed me as mistress of his house.\nAegeus\nCan he have brought himself to such a dastard deed?\nMedeA\nBe assured thereof; I, whom he loved of yore, am in dishonour now.\nAegeus\nHath he found a new love? or does he loathe thy bed?\nMedeA\nMuch in love is he! A traitor to his friend is he become.\nAegeus\nEnough! if he is a villain as thou sayest.\nMedeA\nThe alliance he is so much enamoured of is with a princess.\nAegeus\nWho gives his daughter to him? go on, I pray.\nMedeA\nCreon, who is lord of this land of Corinth.\n352 Medea\nAegeus\nLady, I can well pardon thy grief.\nMedeA\nI am undone, and more than that, am banished from the land.\nAegeus\nBy whom? fresh woe this word of thine unfolds.\nMedeA\nCreon drives me forth in exile from Corinth.\nAegeus\nDoth Jason allow it? This too I blame him for.\nMedeA\nNot in words, but he will not stand out against it. O, I implore thee by this beard and by thy knees, in suppliant\nposture, pity, O pity my sorrows; do not see me cast forth forlorn, but receive me in thy country, to a seat within thy\nhalls. So may thy wish by heaven\u2019s grace be crowned with a full harvest of offspring, and may thy life close in hap-\npiness! Thou knowest not the rare good luck thou findest here, for I will make thy childlessness to cease and cause\nthee to beget fair issue; so potent are the spells I know.\nAegeus\nLady, on many grounds I am most fain to grant thee this thy boon, first for the gods\u2019 sake, next for the children\nwhom thou dost promise I shall beget; for in respect of this I am completely lost. \u2018Tis thus with me; if e\u2019er thou\nreach my land, I will attempt to champion thee as I am bound to do. Only one warning I do give thee first, lady; I\nwill not from this land bear thee away, yet if of thyself thou reach my halls, there shalt thou bide in safety and I will\nnever yield thee up to any man. But from this land escape without my aid, for I have no wish to incur the blame of\nmy allies as well.\nMedeA\nIt shall be even so; but wouldst thou pledge thy word to this, I should in all be well content with thee.\nAegeus\nSurely thou dost trust me? or is there aught that troubles thee?\nMedeA\nThee I trust; but Pelias\u2019 house and Creon are my foes. Wherefore, if thou art bound by an oath, thou wilt not\ngive me up to them when they come to drag me from the land, but, having entered into a compact and sworn by\nheaven as well, thou wilt become my friend and disregard their overtures. Weak is any aid of mine, whilst they have\nwealth and a princely house.\nAegeus\nLady, thy words show much foresight, so if this is thy will, I do not, refuse. For I shall feel secure and safe if I\nhave some pretext to offer to thy foes, and thy case too the firmer stands. Now name thy gods.\nMedeA\nSwear by the plain of Earth, by Helios my father\u2019s sire, and, in one comprehensive oath, by all the race of gods.\nAegeus\nWhat shall I swear to do, from what refrain? tell me that.\nMedeA\nSwear that thou wilt never of thyself expel me from thy land, nor, whilst life is thine, permit any other, one of\nmy foes maybe, to hale me thence if so he will.\n353 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAegeus\nBy Earth I swear, by the Sun-god\u2019s holy beam and by all the host of heaven that I will stand fast to the terms I\nhear thee make.\nMedeA\n\u2018Tis enough. If thou shouldst break this oath, what curse dost thou invoke upon thyself?\nAegeus\nWhate\u2019er betides the impious.\nMedeA\nGo in peace; all is well, and I with what speed I may, will to thy city come, when I have wrought my purpose\nand obtained my wish. (Aegeus and his retinue depart.)\nChorus\n(chanting) May Maia\u2019s princely son go with thee on thy way to bring thee to thy home, and mayest thou attain\nthat on which thy soul is set so firmly, for to my mind thou seemest a generous man, O Aegeus.\nMedeA\nO Zeus, and Justice, child of Zeus, and Sun-god\u2019s light, now will triumph o\u2019er my foes, kind friends; on victory\u2019s\nroad have I set forth; good hope have I of wreaking vengeance on those I hate. For where we were in most distress\nthis stranger hath appeared, to be a haven in my counsels; to him will we make fast the cables of our ship when\nwe come to the town and citadel of Pallas. But now will I explain to thee my plans in full; do not expect to hear a\npleasant tale. A servant of mine will I to Jason send and crave an interview; then when he comes I will address him\nwith soft words, say, \u201cthis pleases me,\u201d and, \u201cthat is well,\u201d even the marriage with the princess, which my treacher-\nous lord is celebrating, and add \u201cit suits us both, \u2018twas well thought out\u201d; then will I entreat that here my children\nmay abide, not that I mean to leave them in a hostile land for foes to flout, but that I may slay the king\u2019s daughter by\nguile. For I will send them with gifts in their hands, carrying them unto the bride to save them from banishment, a\nrobe of finest woof and a chaplet of gold. And if these ornaments she take and put them on, miserably shall she die,\nand likewise everyone who touches her; with such fell poisons will I smear my gifts. And here I quit this theme; but\nI shudder at the deed I must do next; for I will slay the children I have borne; there is none shall take them from\nmy toils; and when I have utterly confounded Jason\u2019s house I will leave the land, escaping punishment for my dear\nchildren\u2019s murder, after my most unholy deed. For I cannot endure the taunts of enemies, kind friends; enough!\nwhat gain is life to me? I have no country, home, or refuge left. O, I did wrong, that hour I left my father\u2019s home,\npersuaded by that Hellene\u2019s words, who now shall pay the penalty, so help me God, Never shall he see again alive\nthe children I bore to him, nor from his new bride shall he beget issue, for she must die a hideous death, slain by my\ndrugs. Let no one deem me a poor weak woman who sits with folded hands, but of another mould, dangerous to\nfoes and well-disposed to friends; for they win the fairest fame who live then, life like me.\nLeAder of the Chorus\nSince thou hast imparted this design to me, I bid thee hold thy hand, both from a wish to serve thee and be-\ncause I would uphold the laws men make.\nMedeA\nIt cannot but be so; thy words I pardon since thou art not in the same sorry plight that I am.\nLeAder\nO lady, wilt thou steel thyself to slay thy children twain?\nMedeA\nI will, for that will stab my husband to the heart.\nLeAder\nIt may, but thou wilt be the saddest wife alive.\n354 Medea\nMedeA\nNo matter; wasted is every word that comes \u2018twixt now and then. Ho! (The Nurse enters in answer to her call.)\nThou, go call me Jason hither, for thee I do employ on every mission of trust. No word divulge of all my purpose, as\nthou art to thy mistress loyal and likewise of my sex. (The Nurse goes out.)\nChorus\n(singing, strophe 1)\nSons of Erechtheus, heroes happy from of yore, children of the blessed gods, fed on wisdom\u2019s glorious food in a\nholy land ne\u2019er pillaged by its foes, ye who move with sprightly step through a climate ever bright and clear, where,\nas legend tells, the Muses nine, Pieria\u2019s holy maids, were brought to birth by Harmonia with the golden hair.\n(antistrophe 1)\nAnd poets sing how Cypris drawing water from the streams of fair-flowing Cephissus breathes o\u2019er the land a\ngentle breeze of balmy winds, and ever as she crowns her tresses with a garland of sweet rose-buds sends forth the\nLoves to sit by wisdom\u2019s side, to take part in every excellence.\n(strophe 2)\nHow then shall the city of sacred streams, the land that welcomes those it loves, receive thee, the murderess of\nthy children, thee whose presence with others is a pollution? \u2018Think on the murder of thy children, consider the\nbloody deed thou takest on thee. Nay, by thy knees we, one and all, implore thee, slay not thy babes.\n(antistrophe 2)\nWhere shall hand or heart find hardihood enough in wreaking such a fearsome deed upon thy sons? How wilt\nthou look upon thy babes, and still without a tear retain thy bloody purpose? Thou canst not, when they fall at thy\nfeet for mercy, steel thy heart and dip in their blood thy hand. (Jason enters.)\nJAsoN\nI am come at thy bidding, for e\u2019en though thy hate for me is bitter thou shalt not fail in this small boon, but I\nwill hear what new request thou hast to make of me, lady.\nMedeA\nJason, I crave thy pardon for the words I spoke, and well thou mayest brook my burst of passion, for ere now we\ntwain have shared much love. For I have reasoned with my soul and railed upon me thus, \u201cAh! poor heart! why am\nI thus distraught, why so angered \u2018gainst all good advice, why have I come to hate the rulers of the land, my hus-\nband too, who does the best for me he can, in wedding with a princess and rearing for my children noble brothers?\nShall I not cease to fret? What possesses me, when heaven its best doth offer? Have I not my children to consider?\ndo I forget that we are fugitives, in need of friends?\u201d When I had thought all this I saw how foolish I had been, how\nsenselessly enraged. So now do commend thee and think thee most wise in forming this connection for us; but I\nwas mad, I who should have shared in these designs, helped on thy plans, and lent my aid to bring about the match,\nonly too pleased to wait upon thy bride. But what we are, we are, we women, evil I will not say; wherefore thou\nshouldst not sink to our sorry level nor with our weapons meet our childishness. I yield and do confess that I was\nwrong then, but now have I come to a better mind. Come hither, my children, come, leave the house, step forth, and\nwith me greet and bid farewell to your father, be reconciled from all past bitterness unto your friends, as now your\nmother is; for we have made a truce and anger is no more. (The Attendant comes out of the house with the chil-\ndren.) Take his right hand; ah me! my sad fate! when I reflect, as now, upon the hidden future. O my children, since\nthere awaits you even thus a long, long life, stretch forth the hand to take a fond farewell. Ah me! how new to tears\nam I, how full of fear! For now that I have at last released me from my quarrel with your father, I let the tear-drops\nstream adown my tender cheek.\nLeAder of the Chorus\nFrom my eyes too bursts forth the copious tear; O, may no greater ill than the present e\u2019er befall!\n355 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nJAsoN\nLady, I praise this conduct, not that I blame what is past; for it is but natural to the female sex to vent their\nspleen against a husband when he trafficks in other marriages besides his own. But thy heart is changed to wiser\nschemes and thou art determined on the better course, late though it be; this is acting like a woman of sober sense.\nAnd for you, my sons, hath your father provided with all good heed a sure refuge, by God\u2019s grace; for ye, I trow,\nshall with your brothers share hereafter the foremost rank in this Corinthian realm. Only grow up, for all the rest\nyour sire and whoso of the gods is kind to us is bringing to pass. May I see you reach man\u2019s full estate, high o\u2019er the\nheads of those I hate! But thou, lady, why with fresh tears dost thou thine eyelids wet, turning away thy wan cheek,\nwith no welcome for these my happy tidings?\nMedeA\n\u2018Tis naught; upon these children my thoughts were turned.\nJAsoN\nThen take heart; for I will see that it is well with them.\nMedeA\nI will do so; nor will I doubt thy word; woman is a weak creature, ever given to tears.\nJAsoN\nWhy prithee, unhappy one, dost moan o\u2019er these children?\nMedeA\nI gave them birth; and when thou didst pray long life for them, pity entered into my soul to think that these\nthings must be. But the reason of thy coming hither to speak with me is partly told, the rest will I now mention.\nSince it is the pleasure of the rulers of the land to banish me, and well I know \u2018twere best for me to stand not in the\nway of thee or of the rulers by dwelling here, enemy as I am thought unto their house, forth from this land in exile\nam I going, but these children,-that they may know thy fostering hand, beg Creon to remit their banishment.\nJAsoN\nI doubt whether I can persuade him, yet must I attempt it.\nMedeA\nAt least do thou bid thy wife ask her sire this boon, to remit the exile of the children from this land.\nJAsoN\nYea, that will I; and her methinks I shall persuade, since she is woman like the rest.\nMedeA\nI too will aid thee in this task, for by the children\u2019s hand I will send to her gifts that far surpass in beauty, I\nwell know, aught that now is seen \u2018mongst men, a robe of finest tissue and a chaplet of chased gold. But one of my\nattendants must haste and bring the ornaments hither. (A servant goes into the house.) Happy shall she be not once\nalone but ten thousand-fold, for in thee she wins the noblest soul to share her love, and gets these gifts as well which\non a day my father\u2019s sire, the Sun-god, bestowed on his descendants. (The servant returns and hands the gifts to the\nchildren.) My children, take in your hands these wedding gifts, and bear them as an offering to the royal maid, the\nhappy bride; for verily the gifts she shall receive are not to be scorned.\nJAsoN\nBut why so rashly rob thyself of these gifts? Dost think a royal palace wants for robes or gold? Keep them, nor\ngive them to another. For well I know that if my lady hold me in esteem, she will set my price above all wealth.\nMedeA\nSay not so; \u2018tis said that gifts tempt even gods; and o\u2019er men\u2019s minds gold holds more potent sway than countless\nwords. Fortune smiles upon thy bride, and heaven now doth swell her triumph; youth is hers and princely power; yet\nto save my children from exile I would barter life, not dross alone. Children, when we are come to the rich palace, pray\n356 Medea\nyour father\u2019s new bride, my mistress, with suppliant voice to save you from exile, offering her these ornaments the\nwhile; for it is most needful that she receive the gifts in her own hand. Now go and linger not; may ye succeed and to\nyour mother bring back the glad tidings she fain would hear (Jason, the Attendant, and the children go out together.)\nChorus\n(singing, strophe 1)\nGone, gone is every hope I had that the children yet might live; forth to their doom they now proceed. The hap-\nless bride will take, ay, take the golden crown that is to be her ruin; with her own hand will she lift and place upon\nher golden locks the garniture of death.\n(antistrophe 1)\nIts grace and sheen divine will tempt her to put on the robe and crown of gold, and in that act will she deck\nherself to be a bride amid the dead. Such is the snare whereinto she will fall, such is the deadly doom that waits the\nhapless maid, nor shall she from the curse escape.\n(strophe 2)\nAnd thou, poor wretch, who to thy sorrow art wedding a king\u2019s daughter, little thinkest of the doom thou art\nbringing on thy children\u2019s life, or of the cruel death that waits thy bride. Woe is thee! how art thou fallen from thy\nhigh estate!\n(antistrophe 2)\nNext do I bewail thy sorrows, O mother hapless in thy children, thou who wilt slay thy babes because thou hast\na rival, the babes thy husband hath deserted impiously to join him to another bride. (The Attendant enters with the\nchildren.)\nAtteNdANt\nThy children, lady, are from exile freed, and gladly did the royal bride accept thy gifts in her own hands, and so\nthy children made their peace with her.\nMedeA\nAh!\nAtteNdANt\nWhy art so disquieted in thy prosperous hour? Why turnest thou thy cheek away, and hast no welcome for my\nglad news?\nMedeA\nAh me!\nAtteNdANt\nThese groans but ill accord with the news I bring.\nMedeA\nAh me! once more I say.\nAtteNdANt\nHave I unwittingly announced some evil tidings? Have I\nerred in thinking my news was good?\nMedeA\nThy news is as it is; I blame thee not.\n357 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAtteNdANt\nThen why this downcast eye, these floods of tears?\nMedeA\nOld friend, needs must I weep; for the gods and I with fell intent devised these schemes.\nAtteNdANt\nBe of good cheer; thou too of a surety shalt by thy sons yet be brought home again.\nMedeA\nEre that shall I bring others to their home, ah! woe is me\nAtteNdANt\nThou art not the only mother from thy children reft. Bear patiently thy troubles as a mortal must.\nMedeA\nI will obey; go thou within the house and make the day\u2019s provision for the children. (The Attendant enters the\nhouse. Medea turns to the children.) O my babes, my babes, ye have still a city and a home, where far from me and\nmy sad lot you will live your lives, reft of your mother for ever; while I must to another land in banishment, or ever\nI have had my joy of you, or lived to see you happy, or ever I have graced your marriage couch, your bride, your\nbridal bower, or lifted high the wedding torch. Ah me! a victim of my own self-will. So it was all in vain I reared\nyou, O my sons; in vain did suffer, racked with anguish, enduring the cruel pangs of childbirth. \u2018Fore Heaven I once\nhad hope, poor me! high hope of ye that you would nurse me in my age and deck my corpse with loving hands, a\nboon we mortals covet; but now is my sweet fancy dead and gone; for I must lose you both and in bitterness and\nsorrow drag through life. And ye shall never with fond eyes see your mother more for o\u2019er your life there comes a\nchange. Ah me! ah me! why do ye look at me so, my children? why smile that last sweet smile? Ah me! what am I to\ndo? My heart gives way when I behold my children\u2019s laughing eyes. O, I cannot; farewell to all my former schemes;\nI will take the children from the land, the babes I bore. Why should I wound their sire by wounding them, and get\nme a twofold measure of sorrow? No, no, I will not do it. Farewell my scheming! And yet what possesses me? Can\nI consent to let those foes of mine escape from punishment, and incur their mockery? I must face this deed. Out\nupon my craven heart! to think that I should even have let the soft words escape my soul. Into the house, children!\n(The children go into the house.) And whoso feels he must not be present at my sacrifice, must see to it himself; I\nwill not spoil my handiwork. Ah! ah! do not, my heart, O do not do this deed! Let the children go, unhappy one,\nspare the babes! For if they live, they will cheer thee in our exile there. Nay, by the fiends of hell\u2019s abyss, never, never\nwill I hand my children over to their foes to mock and flout. Die they must in any case, and since \u2018tis so, why I, the\nmother who bore them, will give the fatal blow. In any case their doom is fixed and there is no escape. Already the\ncrown is on her head, the robe is round her, and she is dying, the royal bride; that do I know full well. But now since\nI have a piteous path to tread, and yet more piteous still the path I send my children on, fain would I say farewell to\nthem. (The children come out at her call. She takes them in her arms.) O my babes, my babes, let your mother kiss\nyour hands. Ah! hands I love so well, O lips most dear to me! O noble form and features of my children, I wish ye\njoy, but in that other land, for here your father robs you of your home. O the sweet embrace, the soft young cheek,\nthe fragrant breath! my children! Go, leave me; I cannot bear to longer look upon ye; my sorrow wins the day. At\nlast I understand the awful deed I am to do; but passion, that cause of direst woes to mortal man, hath triumphed\no\u2019er my sober thoughts. (She goes into the house with the children.)\nChorus\n(chanting) Oft ere now have I pursued subtler themes and have faced graver issues than woman\u2019s sex should\nseek to probe; but then e\u2019en we aspire to culture, which dwells with us to teach us wisdom; I say not all; for small is\nthe class amongst women-(one maybe shalt thou find \u2018mid many)-that is not incapable of wisdom. And amongst\nmortals I do assert that they who are wholly without experience and have never had children far surpass in happi-\nness those who are parents. The childless, because they have never proved whether children grow up to be a bless-\ning or curse to men are removed from all share in many troubles; whilst those who have a sweet race of children\ngrowing up in their houses do wear away, as I perceive, their whole life through; first with the thought how they\nmay train them up in virtue, next how they shall leave their sons the means to live; and after all this \u2018tis far from\nclear whether on good or bad children they bestow their toil. But one last crowning woe for every mortal man now\nwill name; suppose that they have found sufficient means to live, and seen their children grow to man\u2019s estate and\n358 Medea\nwalk in virtue\u2019s path, still if fortune so befall, comes Death and bears the children\u2019s bodies off to Hades. Can it be\nany profit to the gods to heap upon us mortal men beside our other woes this further grief for children lost, a grief\nsurpassing all? (Medea comes out of the house.)\nMedeA\nKind friends, long have I waited expectantly to know how things would at the palace chance. And lo! I see one\nof Jason\u2019s servants coming hither, whose hurried gasps for breath proclaim him the bearer of some fresh tidings. (A\nMessenger rushes in.)\nMesseNger\nFly, fly, Medea! who hast wrought an awful deed, transgressing every law: nor leave behind or sea-borne bark or\ncar that scours the plain.\nMedeA\nWhy, what hath chanced that calls for such a flight of mine?\nMesseNger\nThe princess is dead, a moment gone, and Creon too, her sire, slain by those drugs of thine.\nMedeA\nTidings most fair are thine! Henceforth shalt thou be ranked amongst my friends and benefactors.\nMesseNger\nHa! What? Art sane? Art not distraught, lady, who hearest with joy the outrage to our royal house done, and art\nnot at the horrid tale afraid?\nMedeA\nSomewhat have I, too, to say in answer to thy words. Be not so hasty, friend, but tell the manner of their death,\nfor thou wouldst give me double joy, if so they perished miserably.\nMesseNger\nWhen the children twain whom thou didst bear came with their father and entered the palace of the bride,\nright glad were we thralls who had shared thy griefs, for instantly from ear to ear a rumour spread that thou and thy\nlord had made up your former quarrel. One kissed thy children\u2019s hands, another their golden hair, while I for very\njoy went with them in person to the women\u2019s chambers. Our mistress, whom now we do revere in thy room, cast a\nlonging glance at Jason, ere she saw thy children twain; but then she veiled her eyes and turned her blanching cheek\naway, disgusted at their coming; but thy husband tried to check his young bride\u2019s angry humour with these words:\n\u201cO, be not angered \u2018gainst thy friends; cease from wrath and turn once more thy face this way, counting as friends\nwhomso thy husband counts, and accept these gifts, and for my sake crave thy sire to remit these children\u2019s exile.\u201d\nSoon as she saw the ornaments, no longer she held out, but yielded to her lord in all; and ere the father and his\nsons were far from the palace gone, she took the broidered robe and put it on, and set the golden crown about her\ntresses, arranging her hair at her bright mirror, with many a happy smile at her breathless counterfeit. Then rising\nfrom her seat she passed across the chamber, tripping lightly on her fair white foot, exulting in the gift, with many a\nglance at her uplifted ankle. When lo! a scene of awful horror did ensue. In a moment she turned pale, reeled back-\nwards, trembling in every limb, and sinks upon a seat scarce soon enough to save herself from falling to the ground.\nAn aged dame, one of her company, thinking belike it was a fit from Pan or some god sent, raised a cry of prayer, till\nfrom her mouth she saw the foam-flakes issue, her eyeballs rolling in their sockets, and all the blood her face desert;\nthen did she raise a loud scream far different from her former cry. Forthwith one handmaid rushed to her father\u2019s\nhouse, another to her new bridegroom to tell his bride\u2019s sad fate, and the whole house echoed with their running to\nand fro. By this time would a quick walker have made the turn in a course of six plethra and reached the goal, when\nshe with one awful shriek awoke, poor sufferer, from her speechless trance and oped her closed eyes, for against\nher a twofold anguish was warring. The chaplet of gold about her head was sending forth a wondrous stream of\nravening flame, while the fine raiment, thy children\u2019s gift, was preying on the hapless maiden\u2019s fair white flesh; and\nshe starts from her seat in a blaze and seeks to fly, shaking her hair and head this way and that, to cast the crown\ntherefrom; but the gold held firm to its fastenings, and the flame, as she shook her locks, blazed forth the more with\n359 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ndouble fury. Then to the earth she sinks, by the cruel blow o\u2019ercome; past all recognition now save to a father\u2019s eye;\nfor her eyes had lost their tranquil gaze, her face no more its natural look preserved, and from the crown of her\nhead blood and fire in mingled stream ran down; and from her bones the flesh kept peeling off beneath the gnaw-\ning of those secret drugs, e\u2019en as when the pine-tree weeps its tears of pitch, a fearsome sight to see. And all were\nafraid to touch the corpse, for we were warned by what had chanced. Anon came her haples father unto the house,\nall unwitting of her doom, and stumbles o\u2019er the dead, and loud he cried, and folding his arms about her kissed her,\nwith words like these the while, \u201cO my poor, poor child, which of the gods hath destroyed thee thus foully? Who is\nrobbing me of thee, old as I am and ripe for death? O my child, alas! would I could die with thee!\u201d He ceased his sad\nlament, and would have raised his aged frame, but found himself held fast by the fine-spun robe as ivy that clings\nto the branches of the bay, and then ensued a fearful struggle. He strove to rise, but she still held him back; and if\never he pulled with all his might, from off his bones his aged flesh he tore. At last he gave it up, and breathed forth\nhis soul in awful suffering; for he could no longer master the pain. So there they lie, daughter and aged sire, dead\nside by side, a grievous sight that calls for tears. And as for thee, I leave thee out of my consideration, for thyself\nmust discover a means to escape punishment. Not now for the first time I think this human life a shadow; yea, and\nwithout shrinking I will say that they amongst men who pretend to wisdom and expend deep thought on words\ndo incur a serious charge of folly; for amongst mortals no man is happy; wealth may pour in and make one luckier\nthan another, but none can happy be. (The Messenger departs.)\nLeAder of the Chorus\nThis day the deity, it seems, will mass on Jason, as he well deserves, heavy load of evils. Woe is thee, daughter of\nCreon We pity thy sad fate, gone as thou art to Hades\u2019 halls as the price of thy marriage with Jason.\nMedeA\nMy friends, I am resolved upon the deed; at once will I slay my children and then leave this land, without de-\nlaying long enough to hand them over to some more savage hand to butcher. Needs must they die in any case; and\nsince they must, I will slay them-I, the mother that bare them. O heart of mine, steel thyself! Why do I hesitate to\ndo the awful deed that must be done? Come, take the sword, thou wretched hand of mine! Take it, and advance to\nthe post whence starts thy life of sorrow! Away with cowardice! Give not one thought to thy babes, how dear they\nare or how thou art their mother. This one brief day forget thy children dear, and after that lament; for though thou\nwilt slay them yet they were thy darlings still, and I am a lady of sorrows. (Medea enters the house.)\nChorus\n(chanting) O earth, O sun whose beam illumines all, look, look upon this lost woman, ere she stretch forth her\nmurderous hand upon her sons for blood; for lo! these are scions of thy own golden seed, and the blood of gods is\nin danger of being shed by man. O light, from Zeus proceeding, stay her, hold her hand, forth from the house chase\nthis fell bloody fiend by demons led. Vainly wasted were the throes thy children cost thee; vainly hast thou borne,\nit seems, sweet babes, O thou who hast left behind thee that passage through the blue Symplegades, that strangers\njustly hate. Ah! hapless one, why doth fierce anger thy soul assail? Why in its place is fell murder growing up? For\ngrievous unto mortal men are pollutions that come of kindred blood poured on the earth, woes to suit each crime\nhurled from heaven on the murderer\u2019s house.\nfirst soN\n(within) Ah, me; what can I do? Whither fly to escape my mother\u2019s blows?\nseCoNd soN\n(within) I know not, sweet brother mine; we are lost.\nChorus\n(chanting) Didst hear, didst hear the children\u2019s cry? O lady, born to sorrow, victim of an evil fate! Shall I enter\nthe house? For the children\u2019s sake I am resolved to ward off the murder.\nfirst soN\n(within) Yea, by heaven I adjure you; help, your aid is needed.\n360 Medea\nseCoNd soN\n(within) Even now the toils of the sword are closing round us.\nChorus\n(chanting) O hapless mother, surely thou hast a heart of stone or steel to slay the offspring of thy womb by such\na murderous doom. Of all the wives of yore I know but one who laid her hand upon her children dear, even Ino,\nwhom the gods did madden in the day that the wife of Zeus drove her wandering from her home. But she, poor suf-\nferer, flung herself into the sea because of the foul murder of her children, leaping o\u2019er the wave-beat cliff, and in her\ndeath was she united to her children twain. Can there be any deed of horror left to follow this? Woe for the wooing\nof women fraught with disaster! What sorrows hast thou caused for men ere now! (Jason and his attendants enter.)\nJAsoN\nLadies, stationed near this house, pray tell me is the author of these hideous deeds, Medea, still within, or hath\nshe fled from hence? For she must hide beneath the earth or soar on wings towards heaven\u2019s vault, if she would\navoid the vengeance of the royal house. Is she so sure she will escape herself unpunished from this house, when she\nhath slain the rulers of the land? But enough of this! I am forgetting her children. As for her, those whom she hath\nwronged will do the like by her; but I am come to save the children\u2019s life, lest the victim\u2019s kin visit their wrath on me,\nin vengeance for the murder foul, wrought by my children\u2019s mother.\nLeAder of the Chorus\nUnhappy man, thou knowest not the full extent of thy misery, else had thou never said those words.\nJAsoN\nHow now? Can she want to kill me too?\nLeAder\nThy sons are dead; slain by their own mother\u2019s hand.\nJAsoN\nO God! what sayest thou? Woman, thou hast sealed my doom.\nLeAder\nThy children are no more; be sure of this.\nJAsoN\nWhere slew she them; within the palace or outside?\nLeAder\nThrow wide the doors and see thy children\u2019s murdered corpses.\nJAsoN\nHaste, ye slaves, loose the bolts, undo the fastenings, that I may see the sight of twofold woe, my murdered sons\nand her, whose blood in vengeance I will shed. Medea appears above the house, on a chariot drawn by dragons; the\nchildren\u2019s corpses are beside her.)\nMedeA\nWhy shake those doors and attempt to loose their bolts, in quest of the dead and me their murderess? From\nsuch toil desist. If thou wouldst aught with me, say on, if so thou wilt; but never shalt thou lay hand on me, so swift\nthe steeds the sun, my father\u2019s sire, to me doth give to save me from the hand of my foes.\nJAsoN\nAccursed woman! by gods, by me and all mankind abhorred as never woman was, who hadst the heart to stab thy\nbabes, thou their mother, leaving me undone and childless; this hast thou done and still dost gaze upon the sun and\n361 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nearth after this deed most impious. Curses on thee! now perceive what then I missed in the day I brought thee, fraught\nwith doom, from thy home in a barbarian land to dwell in Hellas, traitress to thy sire and to the land that nurtured thee.\nOn me the gods have hurled the curse that dogged thy steps, for thou didst slay thy brother at his hearth ere thou cam\u2019st\naboard our fair ship, Argo. Such was the outset of thy life of crime; then didst thou wed with me, and having borne me\nsons to glut thy passion\u2019s lust, thou now hast slain them. Not one amongst the wives of Hellas e\u2019er had dared this deed;\nyet before them all I chose thee for my wife, wedding a foe to be my doom, no woman, but a lioness fiercer than Tyr-\nrhene Scylla in nature. But with reproaches heaped thousandfold I cannot wound thee, so brazen is thy nature. Perish,\nvile sorceress, murderess of thy babes! Whilst I must mourn my luckless fate, for I shall ne\u2019er enjoy my new-found bride,\nnor shall I have the children, whom I bred and reared, alive to say the last farewell to me; nay, I have lost them.\nMedeA\nTo this thy speech I could have made a long reply, but Father Zeus knows well all I have done for thee, and the\ntreatment thou hast given me. Yet thou wert not ordained to scorn my love and lead a life of joy in mockery of me,\nnor was thy royal bride nor Creon, who gave thee a second wife, to thrust me from this land and rue it not. Where-\nfore, if thou wilt, call me e\u2019en a lioness, and Scylla, whose home is in the Tyrrhene land; for I in turn have wrung thy\nheart, as well I might.\nJAsoN\nThou, too, art grieved thyself, and sharest in my sorrow.\nMedeA\nBe well assured I am; but it relieves my pain to know thou canst not mock at me.\nJAsoN\nO my children, how vile a mother ye have found!\nMedeA\nMy sons, your father\u2019s feeble lust has been your ruin!\nJAsoN\n\u2018Twas not my hand, at any rate, that slew them.\nMedeA\nNo, but thy foul treatment of me, and thy new marriage.\nJAsoN\nDidst think that marriage cause enough to murder them?\nMedeA\nDost think a woman counts this a trifling injury?\nJAsoN\nSo she be self-restrained; but in thy eyes all is evil.\nMedeA\nThy sons are dead and gone. That will stab thy heart.\nJAsoN\nThey live, methinks, to bring a curse upon thy head.\nMedeA\nThe gods know, whoso of them began this troublous coil.\n362 Medea\nJAsoN\nIndeed, they know that hateful heart of thine.\nMedeA\nThou art as hateful. I am aweary of thy bitter tongue.\nJAsoN\nAnd I likewise of thine. But parting is easy.\nMedeA\nSay how; what am I to do? for I am fain as thou to go.\nJAsoN\nGive up to me those dead, to bury and lament.\nMedeA\nNo, never! I will bury them myself, bearing them to Hera\u2019s sacred field, who watches o\u2019er the Cape, that none\nof their foes may insult them by pulling down their tombs; and in this land of Sisyphus I will ordain hereafter a\nsolemn feast and mystic rites to atone for this impious murder. Myself will now to the land of Erechtheus, to dwell\nwith Aegeus, Pandion\u2019s son. But thou, as well thou mayst, shalt die a caitiff\u2019s death, thy head crushed \u2018neath a shat-\ntered relic of Argo, when thou hast seen the bitter ending of my marriage.\nJAsoN\nThe curse of our sons\u2019 avenging spirit and of justice, that calls for blood, be on thee!\nMedeA\nWhat god or power divine hears thee, breaker of oaths and every law of hospitality?\nJAsoN\nFie upon thee! cursed witch! child-murderess!\nMedeA\nTo thy house! go, bury thy wife.\nJAsoN\nI go, bereft of both my sons.\nMedeA\nThy grief is yet to come; wait till old age is with thee too.\nJAsoN\nO my dear, dear children!\nMedeA\nDear to their mother, not to thee.\nJAsoN\nAnd yet thou didst slay them?\nMedeA\nYea, to vex thy heart.\n363 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nJAsoN\nOne last fond kiss, ah me! I fain would on their lips imprint.\nMedeA\nEmbraces now, and fond farewells for them; but then a cold repulse!\nJAsoN\nBy heaven I do adjure thee, let me touch their tender skin.\nMedeA\nNo, no! in vain this word has sped its flight.\nJAsoN\nO Zeus, dost hear how I am driven hence; dost mark the treatment I receive from this she-lion, fell murderess\nof her young?

Is your manner 10\nOne of fear or affection? My will is to assist you\nFor I would be indifferent to pain\nWere I not to have pity after such a supplication as this.\nPRIEST\nOedipus, master of my land:\nYou see how many sit here 15\nBefore your altars\u2014some not yet robust enough\nTo fly far; some heavy as I, Priest of Zeus, with age;\nAnd these, chosen from our unmarried youth.\nEnwreathed like them, our people sit in the place of markets,\nBy the twin shrines of Pallas 20\nAnd by the embers of the Ismenian oracle.\nOur clan, as you yourself behold, already heaves\nToo much\u2014its head bent\nTo the depths bloodily heaving.\nDecay is in the unfruitful seeds in the soil, 25\nDecay is in our herds of cattle\u2014our women\nAre barren or abort, and that god of fever\nSwoops down to strike our clan with an odious plague,\nEmptying the abode of Cadmus and giving dark Hades\nAn abundance of wailing and lamentation. 30\nNot as an equal of the gods do I,\nAnd these children who sit by your altar, behold you\u2014\nBut as the prime man in our problems of life\nAnd in our dealings and agreements with daimons.\nYou arrived at our town of Cadmus to disentangle us 35\nFrom the tax we paid to that harsh Songstress\u2014\nAnd that with less than we knew because\nWithout our experience.

What is saught\nCan be caught, but will escape if not attended to.\nOEDIPUS\nWas Laius in his dwelling, in his fields,\nOr in another land when he met his death?\nCREON\nHe said he was journeying to a shrine: 115\nBut, having gone, he did not return.\nOEDIPUS\n368 Oedipus the King\nWas there no messenger, no other with him\nWho saw anything and whom we could consult and thus learn from?\nCREON\nNo\u2014killed: all of them. Except one who fled in fear\nAnd so saw nothing except the one thing he did speak of seeing. 120\nOEDIPUS\nWhat? One thing may help us learn many more\nAnd such a small beginning may bring us hope.\nCREON\nHe announced that robbers came upon them and, there being so many,\nIn their strength slew them with their many hands.\nOEDIPUS\nHow could robbers do that? Unless\u2014unless silver 125\nWas paid to them, from here! Otherwise, they would not have the courage!\nCREON\nSuch was the opinion. But with Laius killed\nNo one arose to be his avenger since we had other troubles.\nOEDIPUS\nWhat troubles were before you that with your King fallen\nYou were kept from looking? 130\nCREON\nThe convoluted utterances of the Sphinx made us consider what was before us\nAnd leave unknown what was dark.\nOEDIPUS\nThen, as a start, I shall go back to make it visible.\nIt is fitting for Phoebus, and fitting also for you\nFor the sake of him dead, to return your concern there 135\nAnd fair that I am seen as an ally\nIn avenging this land and the god.\nYet not in the name of remote kin\nBut for myself will I banish the abomination\nSince that person who killed may\u2014and soon\u2014 140\nAnd by his own hand, wish to avenge me.\nThus in this way by so giving aid, I also benefit myself.\nNow and swiftly, my children, stand up from these steps\u2014\nRaising your suppliant branches\u2014\nAnd go to summon here the people of Cadmus 145\nFor I shall do all that is required. Either good fortune\u2014\nIf the gods wills\u2014will be shown to be ours, or we shall perish.\n[Exit Oedipus]\nPRIEST\nStand, children, for that favour\nFor which we came he has announced he will do.\nMay Phoebus\u2014who delivered this oracle\u2014 150\nBe our Saviour and cause our suffering to cease.\n[Exit Priest.

I, myself, would not have delayed\nTracking this, even had there been no signs. 215\nBut since it was after these things I became a tax-paying citizen among you citizens,\nI proclaim this now to all who are of Cadmus:\nWhosoever, concerning Laius son of Labdacus,\nKnows the man who killed him\nI command him to declare everything to me. 220\nBut if he is afraid, he can himself remove the accusation\nAgainst him since what awaits him\nShall not be hostile since he shall pass uninjured to another land.\nBut if you know of another from another region\nWhose hand did it, do not be silent 225\nFor I shall reward and confer favours upon you.\nBut if you keep silent because he is your own kin\nOr because you yourself are afraid and so reject this\u2014\nThen hear what I of necessity must do.\nI forbid that man, whoever he is, to be in this land\u2014 230\nThis land where I have power and authority:\nNo one is to receive him nor speak to him;\nNeither is he to share in your offering thanks to the gods,\nNor in the sacrifices or in the libations before them.\nInstead, everyone shall push him away\u2014for our defilement 235\nIs, in truth, him: as the Pythian god\nBy his oracle just now announced to me.\nThus in such a way do I and this god\nAnd the man who was killed become allies\u2014\nAnd so this pact I make concerning he who did that deed 240\nWhether alone or together with others in secret:\nBeing ignoble, may his miserable life ignobly waste away.\nAnd I also make this pact\u2014that should he arrive at my dwelling\nAnd with my consent stay by my hearth, then may that disease\nI desired for those ones come to me! 245\nSo I command you to accomplish this\nOn behalf of me, the god and this land\nNow barren, lain waste and without gods.\nFor even had no god sent you to deal with this matter\nIt would not have been fitting to leave it uncleaned 250\nFor the man killed was both brave and your own lord:\nYou should have enquired. However, I now have the authority\nAnd hold the command that was his,\nAnd now possess his chambers and his woman\u2014seeded by us both\u2014\nAnd by whom we might have children shared in common had that family 255\nNot had its misfortune and thus there had been a birth:\nBut it was not to be, for fate bore down upon him.\n371 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThus, I\u2014as if he were my own father\u2014\nWill fight for him and will go to any place\nTo search for and to seize the one whose hand killed 260\nThat son of Labdacus\u2014he of Polydorus,\nOf Cadmus before that and before then of ancient Agenor.\nAs to those who do not do this for me, I ask the god\nThat the seeds they sow in the earth shall not bring forth shoots\nNor their women children, and also that it be their destiny 265\nTo be destroyed by this thing\u2014or one that is much worse.\nBut as for you others, of Cadmus, to whom this is pleasing\u2014\nMay the goddess, Judgement, who is on our side,\nAnd all of the gods, be with us forever.\nCHORUS\nBound by your oath, my Lord, I speak: 270\nI am not the killer\u2014nor can I point out he who did the killing.\nIt is he who sent us on this search\u2014\nPhoebus\u2014who should say who did that work.\nOEDIPUS\nThat would be fair. But to compel the gods\nAgainst their will is not within the power of any man. 275\nCHORUS\nShall I speak of what I consider is the second best thing to do?\nOEDIPUS\nDo not neglect to explain to me even what is third!\nCHORUS\nHe who sees the most of what Lord Phoebus knows\nIs Lord Tiresias\u2014and it is from his watching, and clearness,\nMy Lord, that we might learn the most. 280\nOEDIPUS\nI have not been inactive in attending to that:\nSince Creon spoke of it, I have sent two escorts\u2014\nAnd it is a wonder after this long why he is not here.\nCHORUS\nWhat can still be told of those things is blunt from age.\nOEDIPUS\nWhat is there? For I am watching for any report. 285\nCHORUS\nIt was said that he was killed by travellers.\nOEDIPUS\nThat I have heard\u2014but no one sees here he who observed that.\nCHORUS\nBut he will have had his share of fear\nHaving heard your pact\u2014and will not have stayed here.\nOEDIPUS\nAnd he who had no fear of the deed? Would such a one fear such words? 290\n372 Oedipus the King\nCHORUS\nBut here is he who can identify him. For observe,\nIt is the prophet of the god who is led here:\nHe who of all mortals has the most ability to reveal things.\n[Enter Tiresias, guided by a boy]\nOEDIPUS\nTiresias\u2014you who are learned in all things: what can be taught; what is never spoken of;\nWhat is in the heavens and what treads on the earth\u2014 295\nAlthough you have no sight, can you see how our clan\nHas given hospitality to sickness? You are our shield,\nOur protector\u2014for you, Lord, are the only remedy we have.\nPhoebus\u2014if you have not heard it from the messengers\u2014\nSent us as answer to our sending: release from the sickness 300\nWill come only if we are skilled enough to discover who killed Laius\nAnd kill them or drive them away from this land as fugitives.\nTherefore, do not deny to us from envy the speech of birds\nOr any other way of divination which you have,\nBut pull yourself and this clan\u2014and me\u2014 305\nPull us away from all that is defiled by those who lie slain.\nOur being depends on you. For if a man assists someone\nWhen he has the strength to do so, then it is a noble labour.\nTIRESIAS\nAh! There is harm in judging when there is no advantage\nIn such a judgement. This I usefully understood 310\nBut then totally lost. I should not have come here.\nOEDIPUS\nWhat is this? Are you heartless, entering here so?\nTIRESIAS\nPermit me to return to my dwelling. Easier then will it be\nFor you to carry what is yours, and I what is mine, if you are persuaded in this.\nOEDIPUS\nSuch talk is unusual because unfriendly toward this clan 315\nWhich nourishes you: will you deprive us of oracles?\nTIRESIAS\nYes\u2014for I know that the words you say\nAre not suitable. And I will not suffer because of mine.\nOEDIPUS\nBefore the gods! Turn aside that judgement! Here, before you,\nAll of us are as humble suppliants! 320\nTIRESIAS\nSince all of you lack judgement, I will not speak either about myself\nOr you and so tell about defects.\nOEDIPUS\nWhat? If you are aware of it but will not speak,\nDo you intend to betray and so totally destroy your clan?\n373 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nTIRESIAS\nI will not cause pain to either you or myself. Therefore, 325\nWhy these aimless rebukes since I will not answer.\nOEDIPUS\nNot...? Why, you ignoble, worthless...! A rock,\nBy its nature, can cause anger. Speak it!\u2014\nOr will you show there is no end to your hardness?\nTIRESIAS\nYou rebuke me for anger\u2014but it is with you 330\nThat she dwells, although you do not see this and blame me instead.\nOEDIPUS\nAnd whose being would not have anger\nHearing how you dishonour our clan!\nTIRESIAS\nBy themselves, these things will arrive\u2014even though my silence covers them.\nOEDIPUS\nThen since they shall arrive, you must speak to me about them! 335\nTIRESIAS\nBeyond this, I explain nothing. But if it is your will,\nBecome savage with wroth in anger.\nOEDIPUS\nYes indeed I will yield to the anger possessing me\nSince I do understand! For I know you appear to me\nTo have worked together with others to produce that deed, 340\nAlthough it was not your hand that did the killing. But\u2014had you sight\u2014\nI would say that the blow was yours and yours alone!\nTIRESIAS\nIs that so! I declare it is to the proclamation\nYou announced that you must adhere to, so that from this day\nYou should not speak to me or these others 345\nSince you are the unhealthy pollution in our soil!\nOEDIPUS\nIt is disrespectful to bound forth\nWith such speech! Do you believe you will escape?\nTIRESIAS\nI have escaped. For, by my revelations, I am nourished and made strong.\nOEDIPUS\nWhere was your instruction from? Certainly not from your craft! 350\nTIRESIAS\nFrom you\u2014for against my desire I cast out those words.\nOEDIPUS\nWhat words? Say them again so I can fully understand.\n374 Oedipus the King\nTIRESIAS\nDid you not hear them before? Or are your words a test?\nOEDIPUS\nThey expressed no meaning to me. Say them again.\nTIRESIAS\nI said you are the killer and thus the man you seek. 355\nOEDIPUS\nYou shall not escape if you injure me so again!\nTIRESIAS\nShall I then say more to make your anger greater?\nOEDIPUS\nAs much as you desire for you are mistaken in what you say.\nTIRESIAS\nI say that with those nearest to you are you concealed\nIn disrespectful intimacy, not seeing the trouble you are in. 360\nOEDIPUS\nDo you believe you can continue to speak so and remain healthy?\nTIRESIAS\nYes, if revelations have power.\nOEDIPUS\nThey do for others, but not for you! They have none for you\nBecause you are blind in your ears, in your purpose as well as in your eyes!\nTIRESIAS\nIn faulting me for that you are unfortunate 365\nBecause soon there will be no one who does not find fault with you.\nOEDIPUS\nYou are nourished by night alone! It is not for me,\nOr anyone here who sees by the light, to injure you.\nTIRESIAS\nIt is not my destiny to be defeated by you\u2014\nApollo is sufficient for that, since it is his duty to obtain vengeance. 370\nOEDIPUS\nWere those things Creon\u2019s inventions\u2014or yours?\nTIRESIAS\nIt is not Creon who harms you\u2014it is yourself.\nOEDIPUS\nAh! Wealth, Kingship and that art of arts\nWhich surpasses others\u2014these, in life, are envied:\nAnd great is the jealousy cherished because of you. 375\nIt is because of this authority of mine\u2014which this clan\nGave into my hands, unasked\u2014\nThat the faithful Creon, a comrade from the beginning,\n375 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nDesires to furtively creep about to overthrow me\nAnd hires this performing wizard, 380\nThis cunning mendicant priest who sees only\nFor gain but who is blind in his art!\nSo now tell me: where and when have you given clear divinations?\nFor you did not\u2014when that bitch was here chanting her verses\u2014\nSpeak out and so give deliverance to your clansfolk. 385\nYet her enigma was not really for some passing man\nTo disclose since it required a prophet\u2019s art:\nBut your augury foretold nothing and neither did you learn anything\nFrom any god! It was I who came along\u2014\nI, Oedipus, who sees nothing!\u2014I who put and end to her 390\nBy happening to use reason rather than a knowledge of augury.\nNow it is me you are trying to exile since your purpose\nIs to stand beside the throne among Creon\u2019s supporters.\nBut I intend to make you sorry! Both of you\u2014who worked together\nTo drive me out. And if I did not respect you as an Elder, 395\nPain would teach you a kind of judgement!\nCHORUS\nYet I suspect that he has spoken\nIn anger, as I believe you did, Oedipus.\nBut this is not what is needed. Instead, it is the god\u2019s oracle\nThat will, if examined, give us the best remedy. 400\nTIRESIAS\nThough you are the King, I have at least an equality of words\nIn return, for I also have authority.\nI do not live as your servant\u2014but for Loxias\u2014\nJust as I am not inscribed on the roll as being under Creon\u2019s patronage.\nThus, I speak for myself\u2014since you have found fault with me because I am blind. 405\nWhen you look, you do not see the trouble you are in,\nNor where you dwell, nor who you are intimate with.\nDo you know from whom your being arose? Though concealed, you are the enemy\nOf your own, below and upon this land:\nOn both sides beaten by your mother and your father 410\nTo be driven out from this land by a swift and angry Fury\u2014\nAnd you who now see straight will then be in darkness.\nWhat place will not be a haven for your cries?\nWhat Cithaeron will not, and soon, resound with them\nWhen you understand your wedding-night in that abode 415\nInto where you fatefully and easily sailed but which is no haven from your voyage?\nNor do you understand the multitude of troubles\nWhich will make you equal with yourself and your children.\nThus it is, so therefore at my mouth and at Creon\u2019s\nThrow your dirt! For there is no other mortal whose being 420\nWill be so completely overwhelmed by troubles as yours.\nOEDIPUS\nAm I to endure hearing such things from him?\nMay misfortune come to you! Go from here\u2014without delay!\nAway from my dwelling! Turn and go!\nTIRESIAS\nI would not have come here, had you not invited me. 425\nOEDIPUS\n376 Oedipus the King\nI did not know you would speak nonsense\nOr I would have been unwilling to ask you here to my dwelling.\nTIRESIAS\nSo you believe I was born lacking sense?\nYet I made sense to those who gave you birth.\nOEDIPUS\nWhat? Wait! Which mortals gave me birth? 430\nTIRESIAS\nIt is on this day that you are born and also destroyed.\nOEDIPUS\nAll that you have said is enigmatic or lacking in reason.\nTIRESIAS\nBut are you not the best among us in working things out?\nOEDIPUS\nDo you find fault with what I have discovered is my strength?\nTIRESIAS\nIt is that very fortune which has totally ruined you. 435\nOEDIPUS\nI am not concerned\u2014if I have preserved this clan.\nTIRESIAS\nThen I shall depart. You\u2014boy! Lead me away.\nOEDIPUS\nLet him lead you away. While here, you are under my feet\nAnd annoy me. When gone\u2014you will give me no more pain.\nTIRESIAS\nI shall go but speak that for which I was fetched, with no dread 440\nBecause of your countenance. For you cannot harm me.\nI say that the man you have long searched for\nAnd threatened and made proclamation about for the killing\nOf Laius\u2014he is present, here.\nAlthough called a foreigner among us, he will be exposed as a native 445\nOf Thebes but have no delight in that event.\nBlind, though recently able to see\u2014\nAnd a beggar, who before was rich\u2014he shall go to foreign lands\nWith a stick to guide him along the ground on his journey.\nAnd he shall be exposed to his children as both their father 450\nAnd their brother; to the woman who gave him birth\nAs both her son and husband; and to his father\nAs his killer who seeded her after him. So go\nWithin to reason this out and if you catch me deceiving you,\nThen say that in my prophecies there is nothing for me to be proud of. 455\n[Exit Tiresias and Oedipus]\nCHORUS\n377 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nWho is the one that the god-inspired oracle-stone at Delphi saw\nWith bloody hands doing that which it is forbidden to speak of?\nFor now is the day for him to move his feet swifter\nThan storm\u2019s horses as he flees\nSince the son of Zeus\u2014armed with fire and lightning\u2014 460\nIs leaping toward him\nAccompanied by those angry\nAnd infallible Furies!\nIt was not that long ago that the omen shone forth\nFrom the snows of Parnassus: Search everywhere for that man who is concealed; 465\nHe who wanders up to the wild-woods,\nThrough caves and among the rocks like some bull\u2014\nHe unlucky in his desolation who by his unlucky feet\nSeeks to elude that prophecy from the Temple at the centre of the world\u2014\nThat living doom which circles around him. 470\nThere is a strange wonder\u2014wrought by he who is skilled in augury;\nI cannot believe, yet cannot disbelieve, nor explain my confusion\nFor fear hovers over me. I cannot see what is here, or what is behind!\nYet\u2014if there was between the family of Labdacus,\nAnd that son of Polybus, any strife existing 475\nEither now or before, I have not learned of it\nTo thus use it as proof to examine by trial and thus attack\nThe public reputation of Oedipus, becoming thus for the family of Labdacus\nTheir ally in respect of that killing which has been concealed.\nRather\u2014this is for Zeus and Apollo, who have the skill 480\nTo understand, although that other man has won more\nFor his discoveries than I.\nEven so, on some things nothing decisive is discovered:\nAs in learning, where by learning\nOne man may overtake another. 485\nThus not before I see that they who accuse him are speaking straight\nWill I declare myself for them\nFor she was visible\u2014that winged girl who came down against him\u2014\nAnd we then saw proof of his knowledge, which was beneficial to our clan.\nSo therefore my decision is not to condemn him as ignoble. 490\n[Enter Creon]\nCREON\nClansmen! Having learnt of a horrible accusation\nMade against me by Oedipus the King\nI hastened here! If, in these our troubles,\nHe deems that he has suffered because of me\u2014\nBeen injured by some word or some deed\u2014 495\nThen I would have no desire to live as long as I might\nHaving to bear such talk! For it is not simple\u2014\nThe damage that would be done to me by such words:\nRather, it would be great, for I would be dishonoured before my clan\u2014\nWith you and my kinsfolk hearing my name dishonoured. 500\nCHORUS\nThat insult perhaps came forth because of anger\u2014\nRather than being a conclusion from reason.\nCREON\nAnd it was declared that it was my reasoning\n378 Oedipus the King\nWhich persuaded the prophet to utter false words?\nCHORUS\nIt was voiced\u2014but I do not know for what reason. 505\nCREON\nWere his eyes straight, was he thinking straight\nWhen he made that allegation against me?\nCHORUS\nI do not know. For I do not observe what my superiors do.\nBut here, from out of his dwelling, comes the Chief himself.\n[Enter Oedipus]\nOEDIPUS\nYou there! Why are you here? Have you so much face 510\nThat you dare to come to my home?\nYou\u2014the one exposed as the killer of its man\nAnd, vividly, as a robber seeking my Kingship!\nIn the name of the gods, tell me if it was cowardice or stupidity\nThat you saw in me when you resolved to undertake this! 515\nDid you reason that I would not observe your cunning treachery\u2014\nOr, if I did learn of it, I would not defend myself?\nInstead, it was senseless of you to set your hand to this\u2014\nWith no crowd or comrades\u2014and go in pursuit of authority:\nThat which is captured by using wealth and the crowd! 520\nCREON\nYou know what you must do\u2014in answer to your words\nBe as long in hearing my reply so that you can, with knowledge, judge for yourself.\nOEDIPUS\nYour words are clever\u2014but I would be mistaken to learn from you,\nSince I have found how dangerous and hostile you are to me.\nCREON\nThat is the first thing you should hear me speak about. 525\nOEDIPUS\nDo not tell me: it is that you are not a traitor!\nCREON\nIf you believe that what is valuable is pride, by itself,\nWithout a purpose, then your judgement is not right.\nOEDIPUS\nAnd if you believe you can betray a kinsman\nAnd escape without punishment, then your judgement is no good. 530\nCREON\nI agree that such a thing is correct\u2014\nSo inform me what injury you say I have inflicted.\nOEDIPUS\nDid you convince me or did you not convince me that I should\n379 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSend a man to bring here that respected prophet?\nCREON\nI am the same person now as the one who gave that advice. 535\nOEDIPUS\nHow long is the duration since Laius\u2014\nCREON\nSince he did what? I do not understand.\nOEDIPUS\nSince he disappeared: removed by deadly force?\nCREON\nThe measurement of that duration is great\u2014far into the past.\nOEDIPUS\nSo\u2014was that prophet then at his art? 540\nCREON\nYes: of equal skill and having the same respect as now.\nOEDIPUS\nAt that period did he make mention of me?\nCREON\nCertainly not to me nor when I was standing nearby.\nOEDIPUS\nWas there no inquiry held about the killing?\nCREON\nIt was indeed undertaken, although nothing was learned. 545\nOEDIPUS\nSo why did that clever person not speak , then?\nCREON\nI do not know. And about things I cannot judge for myself, I prefer to be silent.\nOEDIPUS\nBut you do know why and would say it if you had good judgement!\nCREON\nWhat? If I did know, then I would not deny it.\nOEDIPUS\nIt is that if he had not met with you, 550\nHe would not have spoken about \u201cmy\u201d killing of Laius.\nCREON\nYou should know if he indeed said that.\nNow, however, it is fair that I question you just as you have me.\nOEDIPUS\nQuestion me well\u2014for you will never convict me as the killer!\n380 Oedipus the King\nCREON\nNevertheless. You had my sister\u2014took her as wife? 555\nOEDIPUS\nThat is an assertion that cannot be denied.\nCREON\nDoes she, in this land, possess an authority the equal of yours?\nOEDIPUS\nWhatsoever is her wish, she obtains from me.\nCREON\nAnd am I\u2014who completes the triad\u2014not the equal of you both?\nOEDIPUS\nAnd it because of that, that you are exposed as a traitor to your kin! 560\nCREON\nNo! For consider these reasons for yourself, as I have,\nExamining this first: do you believe anyone\nWould prefer authority with all its problems\nTo untroubled calm if they retained the same superiority?\nI myself do not nurture such a desire 565\nTo be King rather than do the deeds of a King:\nNo one commanding good judgement would, whoever they were.\nNow, and from you, I receive everything with no problems\nBut if the authority was mine, I would have to do many things against my nature.\nHow then could being a King bring me more pleasure 570\nThan the trouble-free authority and power I have?\nI am not yet so much deceived\nAs to want honours other than those which profit me.\nNow, I greet everyone, and now, everyone bids me well\nJust as, now, those who want something from you call upon me 575\nSince only in that way can they possibly have success.\nWhy, then, would I let go of these to accept that?\nA traitor cannot, because of his way of thinking, have good judgement.\nI am not a lover of those whose nature is to reason so\nAnd would not endure them if they did act. 580\nAs proof of this, first go yourself to Pytho\nTo inquire whether the message I brought from the oracle there was true\nAnd if you detect that I and that interpreter of signs\nPlotted together, then kill me\u2014not because of a single vote,\nBut because of two, for you will receive mine as well as yours. 585\nI should not be accused because of unclear reasoning and that alone.\nIt is not fair when the ignoble, rashly,\nAre esteemed as worthy or the worthy as ignoble.\nI say that to cast away an honourable friend is to do the same\nTo that which is with life and which you cherish the most. 590\nIt takes a while for an intuition to be made steady\nFor it is only after a while that a man shows if he is fair\nAlthough an ignoble one is known as such in a day.\nCHORUS\nHonourable words from someone cautious of falling,\nMy Lord. Those swift in their judgement are unsteady. 595\n381 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nOEDIPUS\nBut when there is a plot against me which is swiftly and furtively\nMoving forward, then I must be swift in opposing that plot\nSince if I remain at rest, then indeed\nWhat is about to be done, will be\u2014because of my mistake.\nCREON\nThen you still desire to cast me from this land? 600\nOEDIPUS\nNot so! It is your death, not your exile, that I want!\nCREON\nWhen you explain to me what is the nature of this thing \u201cenvy\u201d\u2014\nOEDIPUS\nYou speak without yielding and not in good faith!\nCREON\nIs it not your \u2018good judgement\u2019 that is keenly being observed?\nOEDIPUS\nBut at least it is mine! 605\nCREON\nAnd for that very reason it is but the equal of mine.\nOEDIPUS\nBut you have a treacherous nature!\nCREON\nBut if nothing has been proved\u2014\nOEDIPUS\nEven so, there must be authority.\nCREON\nNot when that authority is defective. 610\nOEDIPUS\nMy clan! My clan!\nCREON\nA portion of the clan is for me\u2014not wholly for you!\nCHORUS\nMy Lords, stop this! It is fortunate perhaps that I observe\nJocasta approaching from her dwelling, since it is fitting for her\nTo make right the quarrel which now excites you. 615\n[Enter Jocasta]\nJOCASTA\nYou wretches! Why this ill-advised strife\nProduced by your tongues? Are you not dishonoured\u2014when this land\n382 Oedipus the King\nIs suffering\u2014by becoming moved by personal troubles?\nYou should go within; while you, Creon, should go to your dwelling\nSo as not to let what is only nothing become a great sorrow. 620\nCREON\nMy kin by blood! It is horrible what your husband Oedipus,\nFrom two unfair things, has decided it is right to do!\nTo push me from this land of my ancestors\u2014or to seize and kill me!\nOEDIPUS\nYes! For he was, my lady, caught trying to injure\nMy person by a cowardly art. 625\nCREON\n[looking upward]\nDeny me, this day, your assistance\u2014curse and destroy me\nIf I committed that which I am accused of doing!\nJOCASTA\nBefore the god, trust him, Oedipus!\nChiefly because of this oath to the god\nAnd then because of me and these others here beside you. 630\nCHORUS\nMy Lord\u2014be persuaded, having agreed to reflect on this.\nOEDIPUS\nTo what do you wish me to yield?\nCHORUS\nRespect he who before has never been weak\u2014he now strengthened by that oath.\nOEDIPUS\nDo you know what it is that you so desire?\nCHORUS\nI do know. 635\nOEDIPUS\nThen explain what you believe it to be.\nCHORUS\nWhen a comrade is under oath, you should never accuse him\nBecause of unproved rumours and brand him as being without honour.\nOEDIPUS\nThen attend to this well. When you seek this, it is my\nDestruction that is saught\u2014or exile from this land. 640\nCHORUS\nNo! By the god who is Chief of all the gods\u2014\nHelios! Bereft of gods, bereft of kin\u2014may the extremist death\nOf all be mine if such a judgement was ever mine!\nBut ill-fated would be my breath of life\u2014which the decay in this soil\nAlready wears down\u2014if to those troubles of old 645\nThere was joined this trouble between you and him.\n383 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nOEDIPUS\nThen allow him to go\u2014although it requires my certain death\nOr that I, without honour and by force, am thrown out from this land.\nAnd it is because of you, not because of him\u2014the mercy coming from your mouth\u2014\nThat I do this. As for him\u2014wherever he goes\u2014I will detest him! 650\nCREON\nIt is clear that you are hostile as you yield\u2014and so dangerous, even though\nYour anger has gone. For natures such as yours\nAre deservedly painful to whose who endure them.\nOEDIPUS\nThen go away and leave me.\nCREON\nI shall depart. To you, I remain unknown\u2014but to these, here, I am the same. 655\n[Exit Creon]\nCHORUS\nMy Lady\u2014why do you delay in returning with him into your dwelling?\nJOCASTA\nBecause I wish to learn what has happened.\nCHORUS\nSuspicion arising from unreasonable talk\u2014and a wounding that was unfair.\nJOCASTA\nFrom both of them?\nCHORUS\nIndeed. 660\nJOCASTA\nWhat was the talk?\nCHORUS\nToo much for me, too much for this land, wearied before this.\nSince it appears to have ceased, here\u2014let it remain so.\nOEDIPUS\nObserve where you have come to with your prowess in reason\nBy me giving way and blunting my passion! 665\nCHORUS\nMy Lord, I will not say this only this once:\nMy judgement would be defective\u2014and by my purposeless judgements\nWould be shown to be so\u2014if I deserted you,\nYou who when this land I love was afflicted\nAnd despairing, set her straight. 670\nNow be for us our lucky escort, again!\nJOCASTA\nMy Lord\u2014before the god explain to me\nWhat act roused such wroth and made you hold onto it.\n384 Oedipus the King\nOEDIPUS\nIt will be told. For I respect you, my lady, more than them.\nIt was Creon\u2014the plot he had against me. 675\nJOCASTA\nThen speak about it\u2014if you can clearly affix blame for the quarrel.\nOEDIPUS\nHe declared that it was me who had killed Laius.\nJOCASTA\nDid he see it, for him self\u2014or learn of it from someone?\nOEDIPUS\nIt was rather that he let that treacherous prophet bring it\u2014\nSo as to make his own mouth entirely exempt. 680\nJOCASTA\nTherefore, and this day, acquit yourself of what was spoken about\nAnd listen to me, for you will learn for yourself\nThat no mortal is given the skill to make prophecies.\nI bring to light evidence for this:\nAn oracle came to Laius once\u2014not I say 685\nFrom Phoebus himself but from a servant\u2014\nThat his own death was destined to come from a child\nWhich he and I would produce.\nBut\u2014as it was reported\u2014one day foreign robbers\nSlew him where three cart-tracks meet. 690\nAs to the child\u2014his growth had not extended to the third day\nWhen we yoked the joints of its feet\nAnd threw it\u2014by another\u2019s hand\u2014upon a desolate mountain.\nSo, in those days, Apollo did not bring about, for him,\nThat he slay the father who begot him\u2014nor, for Laius, 695\nThat horror which he feared\u2014being killed by his son.\nSuch were the limits set by those words of revelation!\nTherefore, do not concern yourself with them: for what a god\nWants others to find out, he will by himself unmistakably reveal.\nOEDIPUS\nAs I heard you just now my lady, 700\nMy judgement became muddled as the breath of life left me.\nJOCASTA\nWhat has so divided you that you turn away to speak?\nOEDIPUS\nI believed I heard this from you\u2014that Laius\nWas killed near where three cart-tracks meet.\nJOCASTA\nIt was, indeed, voiced\u2014and is so, still. 705\nOEDIPUS\nWhere is the place where came his misfortune?\nJOCASTA\n385 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThe nearby land of Phocis\u2014where the track splits\nTo come from Delphi and from Daulia.\nOEDIPUS\nHow many seasons have passed since that thing was done?\nJOCASTA\nIt was just before you held this land\u2019s authority 710\nThat it was revealed by a herald to the clan.\nOEDIPUS\nO Zeus! What was your purpose in doing this to me?\nJOCASTA\nWhat is it that burdens your heart, Oedipus?\nOEDIPUS\nDo not enquire yet; rather, explain to me the appearance Laius had:\nWas he at the height of his vigour? 715\nJOCASTA\nHe was big\u2014his head covered in hair but having a recent whiteness.\nHis build was not far removed from your own.\nOEDIPUS\nWretch that I am! For it seems that over myself\nI, without looking, threw that terrible curse!\nJOCASTA\nWhat are you saying? My Lord\u2014I tremble as I look at you. 720\nOEDIPUS\nMy courage is replaced by fear\u2014that the prophet possesses sight!\nMore can be explained\u2014if you make known one more thing.\nJOCASTA\nThough I still tremble, if I have knowledge of what you ask, I shall speak it.\nOEDIPUS\nDid he have a slender one\u2014or did he have many men\nAs escort as befits a warrior chieftain? 725\nJOCASTA\nAltogether there were five, one of those being an official\u2014\nAnd one carriage, which conveyed Laius.\nOEDIPUS\nNow it becomes visible. But who was he,\nMy lady, who gave you that report?\nJOCASTA\nA servant\u2014the very person who alone returned, having escaped harm. 730\nOEDIPUS\nThen perhaps he is to be found, at this moment, within our dwelling?\nJOCASTA\n386 Oedipus the King\nDefinitely not. For as soon as he returned here again and saw you\nWere the master of what the dead Laius had held,\nHe beseeched me\u2014his hand touching mine\u2014\nTo send him away to the wilds as a shepherd to a herd, 735\nFar away where he could not see the town.\nAnd so I sent him. For I deemed him worthy,\nAs a slave, to have a greater reward than that favour.\nOEDIPUS\nThen swiftly\u2014and with no delay\u2014can he be returned here?\nJOCASTA\nHe is around. But why do you desire it? 740\nOEDIPUS\nI fear, my lady, that far too much has already\nBeen said by me. Yet it is my wish to see him.\nJOCASTA\nThen he shall be here. But it merits me to learn,\nMy Lord, what burden within you is so difficult to bear.\nOEDIPUS\nI shall not deprive you of that\u2014for what I fear 745\nComes closer. Who is more important to me than you\nTo whom I would speak when going through such an event as this?\nPolybus the Corinthian was my father\u2014\nAnd the Dorian, Merop\u00e8, my mother. I was, in merit,\nGreater than the clansfolk there\u2014until I was, by chance, 750\nAttacked. This, for me, was worthy of my wonder\nAlthough unworthy of my zeal:\nAt a feast a man overfull with wine\nMumbled into his chalice what I was falsely said to be my father\u2019s.\nI was annoyed by this during that day\u2014scarcely able 755\nTo hold myself back. On the one following that, I saught to question\nMy mother and father, and they were indignant\nAt he who had let loose those words at me.\nBecause of this, I was glad, although I came to itch from them\nFor much did they slither about. 760\nSo, unobserved by my mother and father, I travelled\nTo Pytho. But for that which I had come, Phoebus there\nDid not honour me; instead\u2014suffering and strangeness\nAnd misery were what his words foresaw:\nThat I must copulate with my mother\u2014and show, 765\nFor mortals to behold, a family who would not endure\u2014\nAnd also be the killer of the father who planted me.\nI, after hearing this\u2014and regarding Corinth\u2014\nThereafter by the stars measured the ground\nI fled upon so that I would never have to face\u2014 770\nBecause of that inauspicious prophecy\u2014the disgrace of its fulfilment.\nAnd while so travelling I arrived in those regions\nWhere you spoke of the King himself being killed.\nFor you, my lady, I shall declare what has not been spoken of before.\nWhile journeying, I came near to that three-fold track, 775\nAnd at that place an official and a carriage\nWith young horse with a man mounted in it\u2014such as you spoke of\u2014\nCame toward me. And he who was in front as well as the Elder himself\n387 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nWere for driving me vigorously from the path.\nBut the one who had pushed me aside\u2014the carriage driver\u2014 780\nI hit in anger: and the Elder, observing this\nFrom his chariot, watched for me to go past and then on the middle\nOf my head struck me with his forked goad.\nHe was certainly repaid with more! By a quick blow\nFrom the staff in this, my hand, he fell back 785\nFrom the middle of the carriage and rolled straight out!\nAnd then I destroyed all the others. Yet if to that stranger\nAnd Laius there belongs a common relation\nThen who exists who is now as unfortunate as this man, here?\nWho of our race of mortals would have a daimon more hostile\u2014 790\nHe to whom it is not permitted for a stranger nor a clansman\nTo receive into their homes, nor even speak to\u2014\nBut who, instead, must be pushed aside? And it is such things as these\u2014\nThese curses!\u2014that I have brought upon myself.\nThe wife of he who is dead has been stained by these hands 795\nWhich killed him. Was I born ignoble?\nAm I not wholly unclean? For I must be exiled\nAnd in my exile never see my family\nNor step into my own fatherland\u2014or by marriage\nI will be yoked to my mother and slay my father 800\nPolybus, he who produced and nourished me.\nAnd would not someone who decided a savage daimon\nDid these things to me be speaking correctly?\nYou awesome, powerful, gods\u2014\nMay I never see that day! May I go away 805\nFrom mortals, unobserved, before I see\nThe stain of that misfortune come to me.\nCHORUS\nI also, my Lord, would wish to draw away from such things.\nBut surely until you learn from he who was there, you can have expectations?\nOEDIPUS\nIndeed. There is for me just such an expectation, 810\nAnd one alone\u2014to wait for that herdsman.\nJOCASTA\nAnd when he does appear, what is your intent?\nOEDIPUS\nI will explain it to you. If his report is found to be\nThe same as yours, then I shall escape that suffering.\nJOCASTA\nDid you then hear something odd in my report? 815\nOEDIPUS\nYou said he spoke of men\u2014of robbers\u2014being the ones\nWho did the killing. If, therefore, he still\nSpeaks of there being many of them, then I am not the killer\nFor one cannot be the same as the many of that kind.\nBut if he says a solitary armed traveller, then it is clear, 820\nAnd points to me as the person who did that work.\nJOCASTA\n388 Oedipus the King\nYou should know that it was announced in that way.\nHe cannot go back and cast them away\nFor they were heard, here, by the clan\u2014not just by me.\nYet even if he turns away from his former report, 825\nNever, my Lord, can the death of Laius\nBe revealed as a straight fit\u2014for it was Loxias\nWho disclosed he would be killed by the hand of my child.\nBut he\u2014the unlucky one\u2014could not have slain him\nFor he was himself destroyed before that. 830\nSince then I have not by divination looked into\nWhat is on either side of what is next.\nOEDIPUS\nI find that pleasing. However, that hired hand\nShould be summoned here by sending someone\u2014it should not be neglected.\nJOCASTA\nI will send someone, and swiftly. But let us go into our dwelling. 835\nI would not do anything that would be disagreeable to you.\n[Exit Oedipus and Jocasta]\nCHORUS\nMay the goddess of destiny be with me\nSo that I bear an entirely honourable attitude\nIn what I say and in what I do\u2014\nAs set forth above us in those customs born and 840\nGiven their being in the brightness of the heavens\nAnd fathered only by Olympus.\nFor they were not brought forth by mortals,\nWhose nature is to die. Not for them the lethargy\nOf laying down to sleep 845\nSince the god within them is strong, and never grows old.\nInsolence plants the tyrant:\nThere is insolence if by a great foolishness\nThere is a useless over-filling which goes beyond\nThe proper limits\u2014 850\nIt is an ascending to the steepest and utmost heights\nAnd then that hurtling toward that Destiny\nWhere the useful foot has no use.\nYet since it is good for a clan to have combat,\nI ask the god never to deliver us from it: 855\nAs may I never cease from having the god for my champion.\nIf someone goes forth and by his speaking\nOr the deeds of his hands looks down upon others\nWith no fear of the goddess Judgement and not in awe\nOf daimons appearing, 860\nThen may he be seized by a destructive Fate\nBecause of his unlucky weakness.\nIf he does not gain what he gains fairly,\nDoes not keep himself from being disrespectful,\nAnd in his foolishness holds onto what should not be touched, 865\nThen how will such a man thereafter keep away those arrows of anger\nWhich will take revenge on his breath of life?\nFor if such actions are those are esteemed,\nIs this my respectful choral-dance required?\n389 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nNo more would I go in awe to that never to be touched sacred-stone, 870\nNor to that Temple at Abae,\nNor Olympia\u2014if those prophecies do not fit\nIn such a way that all mortals can point it out.\nBut you whom it is right to call my master\u2014\nZeus!\u2014you who rule over everyone: do not forget this, 875\nYou whose authority is, forever, immortal.\nFor they begin to decay\u2014those prophecies of Laius\nGiven long ago, and are even now set aside\nAnd nowhere does Apollo become manifest because esteemed:\nFor the rituals of the gods are being lost. 880\n[Enter Jocasta]\nJOCASTA\nLords of this land\u2014the belief has been given to me\nThat I should go to the Temples of our guardian gods, my hands\nHolding a garland and an offering of incense.\nFor Oedipus lets his breath of life be too much possessed by his heart\nBecause of all his afflictions\u2014since, unlike a man who reasons 885\nAnd determines the limits of what is strange by the past,\nHe is fearful when someone, in speaking, speaks of such things.\nTherefore, since none of my counsels have achieved anything,\nI come here\u2014to you, Lycean Apollo, since you are close to us\u2014\nTo petition you by asking you with these my gifts 890\nThat we are cleansed of defilement by you bringing us deliverance.\nFor now all of us are afraid as we behold\nThat he who is guiding our vessel is wounded.\n[Enter Messenger]\nMESSENGER\nIs it from you, stranger, that I might learn where\nIs the dwelling of King Oedipus: 895\nOr, more particularly, if you have knowledge of where he himself is?\nCHORUS\nHere are his chambers, stranger, and he himself is within.\nBut here is his wife and mother of his children.\nMESSENGER\nMay she always prosper in her prospering descent\nSince by them her marriage is complete. 900\nJOCASTA\nAnd may you, also, stranger, because of your worthy eloquence.\nBut explain to me what you seek in arriving here\nOr what it is that you wish to make known.\nMESSENGER\nWhat is profitable, my lady, for both your family and your husband.\nJOCASTA\nWhat is it? And who sent you here, to us? 905\nMESSENGER\n390 Oedipus the King\nI am from Corinth. And when, presently, I have said my speech,\nThere will be joy\u2014of that I have no doubt\u2014but also an equal sorrowing.\nJOCASTA\nHow can that be? What has a double strength that it could cause that?\nMESSENGER\nHe, as their King: for they who inhabit the land\nOf Isthmia would make him so\u2014so they have said. 910\nJOCASTA\nHow is that? For is not Polybus, the Elder, their Master?\nMESSENGER\nNot now\u2014because death holds him in a tomb.\nJOCASTA\nWhat are you saying? That the father of Oedipus\u2014has died?\nMESSENGER\nIs my report is not correct, then I merit death.\nJOCASTA\nSwiftly\u2014my handmaiden\u2014go to your master 915\nTo tell him this. You prophecies from the gods!\u2014\nWhere is your reality? This was the man whom Oedipus long ago from fear\nAvoided lest he kill him. And now it is because\nOf his own destiny that he died rather than through that of another.\n[Enter Oedipus]\nOEDIPUS\nMy Lady, Jocasta: 920\nWhy did you summon me here from my chamber?\nJOCASTA\nHear this man and, as you listen, watch to where\nIt is that those solemn prophecies of the gods lead.\nOEDIPUS\nWhat report has he\u2014wherever he is from\u2014for me?\nJOCASTA\nHe is from Corinth with the message that your father 925\nPolybus is no more\u2014he is dead.\nOEDIPUS\nThen announce it, stranger\u2014leading it out yourself, old one.\nMESSENGER\nIf that is what I must relate first and clearly\nThen know well that his death has come upon him.\nOEDIPUS\nWas it by treachery\u2014or by dealing with sickness? 930\n391 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nMESSENGER\nA small turn downwards, and the ageing body lies in sleep.\nOEDIPUS\nAm I to assume that he unfortunately perished from a sickness?\nMESSENGER\nIndeed\u2014for he had been allocated a great many seasons.\nOEDIPUS\nAh! Then why, my lady, look toward\nThe altar of some Pythian prophet, or above to those 935\nScreeching birds\u2014whose guidance was that I would\nAssuredly kill my father? But he is dead\nAnd hidden within the earth, while I am here\nWithout having to clean my spear. Unless\u2014it was a longing for me\nWhich destroyed him, and thus he is dead because of me. 940\nBut then\u2014that divine prophecy has been, by that circumstance, taken away\nBy Polybus lying in Hades, and thus has no importance.\nJOCASTA\nDid I not declare such things to you, just now?\nOEDIPUS\nSuch was said\u2014but I turned away because of my fear of them.\nJOCASTA\nDo not anymore wound your heart by such things. 945\nOEDIPUS\nBut how can I not distance myself from that intercourse with my mother?\nJOCASTA\nWhat is there for mortals to fear, for it is chance\nWhich rules over them, and who can clearly foresee what does not exist?\nIt is most excellent to live without a plan\u2014according to one\u2019s ability.\nYou should not fear being married to your mother: 950\nFor many are the mortals who have\u2014in dreams also\u2014\nLain with their mothers, and he to whom such things as these\nAre as nothing, provides himself with a much easier life.\nOEDIPUS\nAll that you expressed is fine, except for this:\nShe who gave me birth is alive, and since she is now still living, 955\nIt is necessary that I\u2014despite your fine words\u2014distance myself from her.\nJOCASTA\nYet the death of your father is a great revelation for you.\nOEDIPUS\nYes\u2014a great one. But I fear she who is living.\nMESSENGER\nWho is this woman that you so fear?\nOEDIPUS\nMerop\u00e8, old one: she who belonged with Polybus. 960\n392 Oedipus the King\nMESSENGER\nAnd what, concerning her, could produce fear in you?\nOEDIPUS\nA strange god-inspired prophecy.\nMESSENGER\nIs it forbidden for someone else to know\u2014or can it be told?\nOEDIPUS\nCertainly. Once, Loxias said to me\nThat I must copulate with my own mother 965\nAnd by my own hands take my father\u2019s blood.\nTherefore, and long ago, I left Corinth\nAnd have kept far away from there. And good fortune has been mine,\nAlthough it is very pleasing to behold the eye\u2019s of one\u2019s parents.\nMESSENGER\nWas that what distanced you from your clan? 970\nOEDIPUS\nYes, old one: I did not want to slaughter my father.\nMESSENGER\nThen why, my Lord, have I not released you from that fear\u2014\nSince I came here as a favour to you?\nOEDIPUS\nCertainly you would merit receiving a reward from me.\nMESSENGER\nAnd that was chiefly why I came here\u2014 975\nThat on your arrival home I would obtain something useful.\nOEDIPUS\nBut I will not rejoin those who planted me.\nMESSENGER\nMy son! It is clearly evident you cannot see what you are doing\u2014\nOEDIPUS\nWhy, old one? Before the gods, enlighten me!\nMESSENGER\n\u2014If it was because of that, that you avoided returning to your home. 980\nOEDIPUS\nYes, out of respect for Phoebus so that what he explained could not be fulfilled.\nMESSENGER\nA defilement brought to you by they who planted you?\nOEDIPUS\nThat, Elder, is the thing I have always feared.\nMESSENGER\n393 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThen you should know that there is nothing to make you tremble.\nOEDIPUS\nNothing? Why\u2014if I was the child born to them? 985\nMESSENGER\nBecause you and Polybus are not kin by blood.\nOEDIPUS\nAre you saying that Polybus did not sire me?\nMESSENGER\nThe same as but no more than this man, here!\nOEDIPUS\nHow can he who sired me be the same as he who did not?\nMESSENGER\nBecause he did not beget you\u2014as I did not. 990\nOEDIPUS\nBut then why did he name me as his son?\nMESSENGER\nKnow that you were accepted from my hands as a gift.\nOEDIPUS\nAnd he strongly loved what came from the hand of another?\nMESSENGER\nHe was persuaded because before then he was without children.\nOEDIPUS\nWhen I was given to him\u2014had you purchased or begotten me? 995\nMESSENGER\nYou were found in a forest valley on Cithaeron.\nOEDIPUS\nAnd why were you travelling in that region?\nMESSENGER\nI was there to oversee the mountain sheep.\nOEDIPUS\nA shepherd\u2014who wandered in search of work?\nMESSENGER\nYes\u2014and that season the one who, my son, was your saviour. 1000\nOEDIPUS\nWhat ailment possessed me when you took me into your hands?\nMESSENGER\nThe joints of your feet are evidence of it.\nOEDIPUS\n394 Oedipus the King\nWhat makes you speak of that old defect?\nMESSENGER\nI undid what held and pierced your ankles.\nOEDIPUS\nA strange disgrace\u2014to carry such a token with me. 1005\nMESSENGER\nSuch was the fortune that named you who you are.\nOEDIPUS\nBefore the gods, tell me whether that thing was done by my father or my mother.\nMESSENGER\nI do not know\u2014he who gave you to me would be the best judge of that.\nOEDIPUS\nWhat? From someone else? Then it was not by chance you found me?\nMESSENGER\nNo\u2014another shepherd gave you to me. 1010\nOEDIPUS\nWho was it? Can you point him out? Tell whom you saw?\nMESSENGER\nHe was perhaps named among those of Laius.\nOEDIPUS\nHe who once and long ago was King of this land?\nMESSENGER\nYes\u2014that man was his shepherd.\nOEDIPUS\nIs he then still living? Is it possible for me to see him? 1015\nMESSENGER\nYou who are of this region would know that best.\nOEDIPUS\nIs there among you here, anyone\nWhoever he might be, who knows this shepherd he speaks of\nOr who has seen him either here or in the wilds?\nIf so, declare it\u2014for here is the opportunity to find out about these things. 1020\nCHORUS\nI believe he is that one in the wilds\nWhom you saught before to see.\nBut it is Jocasta\u2014for certain\u2014who could tell of him.\nOEDIPUS\nMy lady\u2014do you know if it is he who, before,\nWe desired to return to here? Is that the one about whom this person speaks? 1025\nJOCASTA\n395 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThe one he spoke about? Why? Do not return to it\nNor even desire to attend again to this idle talk!\nOEDIPUS\nIt could never be that I would fail to grasp\nThese proofs which will shed light upon my origin.\nJOCASTA\nBefore the gods! If you value your own life, 1030\nDo not seek that. I have enough pain now.\nOEDIPUS\nHave courage\u2014for even if my three mothers past\nWere shown to be three slaves, you would not be the one exposed as low-born.\nJOCASTA\nI beseech you to be persuaded by me. Do not do this.\nOEDIPUS\nI cannot be persuaded not to learn of this for certain. 1035\nJOCASTA\nYet my judgement is for your good\u2014it is said for the best.\nOEDIPUS\nThis \u201cfor the best\u201d pained me before and does so again.\nJOCASTA\nYou, the unlucky one\u2014may you never find out who you are.\nOEDIPUS\nSomeone go and bring that Shepherd here to me,\nFor she can still rejoice in her distinguished origins. 1040\nJOCASTA\nYou are doomed: this and this alone will I\nSay to you\u2014and nothing hereafter!\n[Exit Jocasta]\nCHORUS\nWhy, Oedipus, has your lady gone, taken away\nBy some wild affliction? I am in awe\nOf a misfortune bursting forth because of her silence about this. 1045\nOEDIPUS\nIt is necessary that it does burst forth. However lowly\nMy seed may be, it is my wish to know about it.\nAlthough she is a woman, she has a mature judgement\u2014\nBut even so, perhaps she is ashamed of my low-born origins.\nBut I\u2014who apportion myself a child of the goddess, Fortuna, 1050\nShe of beneficence\u2014will not become dishonoured,\nFor She was the mother who gave me birth: my kinsfolk\nThe moons which separated my greatness and my lowness.\nAs this is the nature of my being, I cannot ever go away from it\nTo another, and so not learn about my birth. 1055\n396 Oedipus the King\nCHORUS\nIf indeed I am a prophet or skillful in reason,\nThen\u2014by Olympus!\u2014you shall not be without the experience,\nO Cithaeron, on the rising of the full moon,\nOf me exalting you\u2014the kinsfolk of Oedipus,\nHis mother and provider\u2014by my choral-dance 1060\nSince a joy has been brought to my King.\nPhoebus\u2014I invoke you, that this may also be pleasing to you!\nWho, my son, of those whose living in years is long,\nDid the mountain-wanderer Pan come down upon\nTo be your father? Or was it Loxias who slept with a woman? 1065\nFor agreeable to him are all those who inhabit the wilds!\nOr perhaps it was he who is the sovereign of Cyllene:\nOr he the mountain-summit dwelling god of those Bacchinites\nWho gladly received you who was found by one of those Helicon Nymphs\nWith whom he so often plays! 1070\nOEDIPUS\nIf it fitting for me\u2014who has never had dealings with him\u2014\nTo make an estimate, Elders, then I believe I see that Shepherd\nWhom we saught before. For his great age\nWould conform and be in accord with that of this man.\nAlso, those who are escorting him are servants 1075\nOf my own family. But, about this, your experience\nHas the advantage over mine since you have seen that Shepherd before.\nCHORUS\nI see him clearly\u2014and, yes, I know him. For if Laius ever had\nA faithful Shepherd, it was this man.\n[Enter Shepherd]\nOEDIPUS\nYou, the stranger from Corinth, I question you first\u2014 1080\nIs this he whom you talked about.\nMESSENGER\nIndeed\u2014you behold him.\nOEDIPUS\nYou there, old man! Here, look at me, and answer\nMy questions. Did you once belong to Laius?\nSHEPHERD\nYes\u2014nourished by him, not purchased as a slave. 1085\nOEDIPUS\nWhat work did you share in or was your livelihood?\nSHEPHERD\nFor the greater part, my living was the way of a shepherd.\nOEDIPUS\nAnd in what region did you mostly dwell with them?\n397 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSHEPHERD\nIt was Cithaeron\u2014and also neighbouring regions.\nOEDIPUS\nThis man here\u2014did you ever observe him there and come to know him? 1090\nSHEPHERD\nDoing what? Which is the man you speak of?\nOEDIPUS\nThis one, standing there. Did you have dealings with him?\nSHEPHERD\nNot as I recall\u2014so as to speak about now.\nMESSENGER\nThat is no wonder, your Lordship. But I shall bring light\nUpon those things which are now unknown. For well do I know 1095\nThat he will see again that region of Cithaeron when he\nWith a double flock and I with one\nWere neighbours and comrades for three entire six month\nDurations from Spring to Arcturus.\nThen for the Winter I would drive mine to my stables 1100\nAnd he, his, to the pens of Laius.\nWas this, of which I have spoken, done or not as I have spoken?\nSHEPHERD\nYour words disclose it\u2014although it is from long ago.\nMESSENGER\nWell, now say you know that you offered me a boy,\nA nursling to rear as my own. 1105\nSHEPHERD\nWhat do you mean? What do you ask me for?\nMESSENGER\nThis, sir, is he who was that youngster!\nSHEPHERD\nMay misfortune come to you! Why do you not keep silent?\nOEDIPUS\nYou\u2014old man. Do not restrain him for it is your speech\nWhich should be more restrained, not his. 1110\nSHEPHERD\nMost noble Lord\u2014what is my fault?\nOEDIPUS\nIn not telling of the child he asked about.\nSHEPHERD\nBut he speaks without looking as he toils without an aim.\nOEDIPUS\nIf you will not speak as a favour, you will when you cry-out.\n398 Oedipus the King\nSHEPHERD\nBefore the gods, do not strike someone who is old. 1115\nOEDIPUS\nSwiftly, one of you, twist his hands behind his back.\nSHEPHERD\nYou unlucky one! What more do you desire to learn from me?\nOEDIPUS\nDid you give him that child he asked about?\nSHEPHERD\nI did. And it would have been to my advantage to die that day.\nOEDIPUS\nIt will come to that if your words are not true. 1120\nSHEPHERD\nYet much more will be destroyed if I do speak.\nOEDIPUS\nThis man, it seems, pushes for a delay.\nSHEPHERD\nI do not. Just now I said I gave him.\nOEDIPUS\nTaken from where? Your abode\u2014or from that of another?\nSHEPHERD\nNot from my own; I received him from someone. 1125\nOEDIPUS\nWho\u2014of these clansmen here? From whose dwelling?\nSHEPHERD\nYour lordship, before the gods do not ask me more.\nOEDIPUS\nYou die if I have to put that question to you again.\nSHEPHERD\nThen\u2014it was one of those fathered by Laius.\nOEDIPUS\nFrom a slave? Or born from one of his own race? 1130\nSHEPHERD\nAh! Here before me is what I dread. Of speaking it...\nOEDIPUS\nAnd I, of hearing it, although hear it I must.\nSHEPHERD\nIt was said to be his own child. But of these things,\n399 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nIt is your lady\u2014who is within\u2014who could best speak of them.\nOEDIPUS\nWhy? Because she gave it to you? 1135\nSHEPHERD\nIndeed, Lord.\nOEDIPUS\nWhy did she want that?\nSHEPHERD\nSo it would be destroyed.\nOEDIPUS\nHow grievous for she who bore the child!\nSHEPHERD\nYes\u2014but she dreaded divine prophecies of ill-omen. 1140\nOEDIPUS\nWhich were?\nSHEPHERD\nThe word was that he would kill his parents.\nOEDIPUS\nThen why did you let this elderly one take him.\nMESSENGER\nBecause, your lordship, of mercy\u2014so that to another land\nHe might fittingly convey it: to where he himself came from. 1145\nBut he saved him for this mighty wound. If then you are\nThe one he declares you to be, know how unlucky was your birth!\nOEDIPUS\nAh! All that was possible has, with certainty, passed away.\nYou\u2014daylight\u2014I now look my last at what I behold by you:\nI, exposed as born from those who should not have borne me\u2014 1150\nAs having been intimate with those I should not, and killed those I should not.\n[Exit Oedipus, Shepherd and Messenger]\nCHORUS\nYou descendants of mortals\u2014\nI count your zest as being equivalent to nothing,\nFor where is the person\nWho has won more from a lucky daimon 1155\nThan just that appearance of fame\nWhich later is peeled away?\nYours\u2014your daimon, Oedipus the unlucky\u2014\nWe hold as an example\nThat nothing mortal is favoured. 1160\nFor, O Zeus, it was beyond the bounds of others\nThat he shot his arrow to win\nAn all-prospering lucky daimon:\n400 Oedipus the King\nHe who in destroying that virginal chantress of oracles\nWith the curved claws, 1165\nArose in my country as a defence against death.\nAnd who since then has been called my Lord\nAnd greatly honoured as the chief of Thebes the magnificent!\nBut now\u2014who has heard of a greater misfortune?\nWho is there so savagely ruined that he dwells with such troubles 1170\nWith his life so changed?\nAlas\u2014Oedipus, the renowned!

From what cause? 1200\nMESSENGER\nBy she herself. But, of those events,\nWhat was most painful is not for you\u2014for you did not view them.\nYet\u2014as long as my Muse is with me\u2014\nYou can learn of the sufferings of her fate.\nShe\u2014coloured by emotion\u2014passed within the hall 1205\nTo run straight to that bridal-bed of hers\nTearing at her hair with the fingers of both her hands.\n401 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThen, she went within\u2014thrusting the doors closed\u2014\nTo invoke Laius, he who long ago was a corpse,\nRecalling that seed she received long ago by which 1210\nHe was killed, to leave her to produce\nUnlucky children from his own begotten child.\nShe lamented the bed of her double misfortune:\nFrom her husband, a husband\u2014and children from that child.\nHow, after that, she perished, I did not see 1215\nFor with a war-cry Oedipus pushed in\u2014and, because of him,\nWe did not behold the end of her suffering.\nTo him, we looked as he ploughed around\nFor wildly he ranged about, demanding his spear,\nHis lady who was not his lady, and where he might find that maternal 1220\nDouble-womb which produced he himself and his children.\nHe was frenzied, and a daimon guided him\u2014\nFor it was no man who was standing nearby\u2014\nAnd with a fearful shout\u2014as if someone led the way\u2014\nHe was propelled into those double-doors and, from their supports, 1225\nBent those hollow barriers to fall into her chamber.\nAnd there we beheld that lady suspended\nIn the swinging braided cords by which she had stricken herself.\nHe, seeing this, with a fearful roar of grief\nLet down the cords which suspended her. Then when she the unfortunate 1230\nWas lain on the ground, there was something dreadful to behold:\nFor he tore from her those gold brooches\nWith which she had adorned herself\nAnd raised them to assault his own circular organs,\nSpeaking such as this: that they would not have sight of 1235\nThose troubles he had suffered or had caused\nBut would henceforth and in darkness have sight of what\nThey should not and what he himself should not have had knowledge of.\nThen with a awesome lament not once but frequently\nHe raised them to strike into his eyes. At each, blood 1240\nFrom his eyes dropped to his beard, not releasing blood\nDrop by drop\u2014but all at once:\nA dark storm hailing drops of blood.\nFrom those two has this burst forth\u2014not on one\nBut on that man and his lady, joined by these troubles. 1245\nThat old prosperity anciently theirs was indeed once\nA worthy prosperity\u2014but now, on this day, there is\nLamentation, misfortune, death, disgrace, and of all those troubles\nThat exist and which have names, there is not one which is not here.\nCHORUS\nDoes he who suffers now rest from injury? 1250\nMESSENGER\nHe shouts for the barriers to be opened to expose\nTo all who are of Cadmus, this patricide,\nThis mother...\u2014I will not say the profanity he speaks\u2014\nSo he can cast himself from this land, and not remain\nFor this dwelling to become cursed because of his curse. 1255\nBut he requires strength and a guide\nFor too great for him to carry is that burden\nWhich he will make known to you.

What daimon\nWith great leaps from a great height\nCame upon you bringing such an unfortunate fate? 1265\nI lament for your bad-luck.\nThough I am not able to look at you\u2014\nThere is much I wish to ask, much to understand,\nMuch to know\nEven though I am here, shivering. 1270\nOEDIPUS\nI am in agony!\nTo where, in my misery, am I carried? To where\nIs my voice conveyed as it flees from me?\nYou\u2014that daimon! To where have you brought me?\nCHORUS\nSomewhere strange with nothing to be heard and nothing to be seen. 1275\nOEDIPUS\nNothing announced the arrival of this dark cloud shrouding me!\nSomething unconquerable\u2014brought by an unfavourable wind.\nAs one do the stings of those goads,\nAnd the recalling of those troubles, pierce me!\nCHORUS\nIt is no surprise that because of such injuries 1280\nYou endure a double mourning and a double misfortune.\nOEDIPUS\nMy friend!\nYou, at least, are my steadfast comrade\nBecause you have the endurance to attend to the blind.\nFor you are not hidden from me\u2014I clearly know, 1285\nEven in this darkness, that it is your voice.\nCHORUS\nYou of strange deeds\u2014how did you bear\nTo so extinguish your sight? What daimon carried you away?\nOEDIPUS\nIt was Apollo\u2014Apollo, my friend,\nWho brought such troubles to such a troubled end. 1290\nBut it was my own hand, and no other, which made the assault\u2014\nI, who suffer this. For why should I have sight\nWhen there was nothing pleasing to see?\nCHORUS\nThese things are as you have said they are.\nOEDIPUS\nWho could I behold? 1295\n403 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nWho could be loved\u2014or whose greeting,\nMy friend, would be delightful to hear?\nSo, and swiftly, send me away from this place.\nSend away, my friend, this great pest\u2014\nThis bringer of a curse: the mortal whom our gods 1300\nDetest the most.\nCHORUS\nYou are as helpless in that resolve as you were in your misfortune:\nThus I wish you had never come to know of those things!\nOEDIPUS\nMay death come to whosoever while roaming those grasslands loosened\nThose cruel fetters and so safely pulled me away from death! 1305\nFor it was not a favourable deed.\nFor had I died then no grief such as this\nWould have been caused to either me or my kin.\nCHORUS\nI also wish that.\nOEDIPUS\nI would not, then, have shed the blood of my father 1310\nAs I journeyed, and not be named by mortals\nAs the husband of she who gave me my birth.\nI am without a god\u2014an unconsecrated child\u2014\nAnd now of the same kind as he who gave me this miserable existence!\nIf there is a trouble which is even older than these troubles, 1315\nThen it will be the lot of Oedipus.\nCHORUS\nI do not know if I could say that your intentions were right,\nFor it is perhaps better to no longer exist than to live, blind.\nOEDIPUS\nBut as to this being done for the best\u2014\nYou should not instruct me, nor offer me more advice. 1320\nFor, if I had eyes, I would not know where to look\nWhen I went to Hades and saw my father\nOr my unfortunate mother, since to both\nI have done what is so outstanding that a strangling is excluded.\nPerhaps the sight of children is desirable: 1325\nTo behold how those buds are mine will grow\u2014\nBut it would certainly not be to these eyes of mine.\nNor would that of this town, or its towers, or the sacrifices\nOffered to daimons. For it was most unfortunate that I\u2014\nWho as no one else in Thebes prospered most excellently\u2014 1330\nBereaved myself of such things by my own declaration\nThat everyone must push aside the profane one\u2014the one the gods\nHave exposed as unclean and of the clan of Laius.\nAfter I have made known this, my stain,\nHow could I look those here straight in the eye? 1335\nCertainly I could not. And if what is heard could be blocked out\nAt that source in my ears, I would not have held myself back\nFrom this miserable body and thus would be blind and also hear nothing!\nFor it is pleasing to dwell away from concern about injury.\nWhy, Cithaeron\u2014why did you receive me, and having accepted, 1340\n404 Oedipus the King\nNot directly kill me so I would never make known\nTo mortals whence I was born?\nO Polybus and Corinth\u2014and you that others called the ancient clan-home\nOf my ancestors\u2014I, the beauty that you reared\nHad bad wounds festering underneath! 1345\nFor I am found to be defective having been defective from my birth.\nYou three routes and concealed valley,\nYou grove and narrow place of the three-fold paths:\nYou took in from my hands that blood which was my father\u2019s\nBut also mine\u2014so perhaps you can still recall 1350\nThose deeds that I did there, and then, when here,\nWhat I also achieved? You\u2014those rites of joy\nWhich gave me my birth and which planted me anew\nBy the same seed being shot up to manifest fathers,\nBrothers, sons\u2014the blood of a kinsman\u2014 1355\nBrides, wives, mothers: as much shame\nAs can arise from deeds among mortals.\nNo one should speak about things they do not favour doing.\nSwiftly then\u2014before the gods and beyond here\u2014\nHide me away or kill me or upon the sea cast me 1360\nSo that you will never look upon me again.\nCome, and dignify this unhappy man by your touch.\nBe persuaded\u2014do not fear.

For they are men, and therefore will never\nLack the ability\u2014wherever they are\u2014to survive. 1410\nBut as for those unfortunate ones, my girls\nFor whom my table of food was never separate from\nNor who were ever without me, so that whatever I touched\nWould be shared between us\u2014\nAttend to them, for me. 1415\nWould that you could let my hands touch them\nAnd they lament for my injuries.\nLet these things be, Lord\u2014\nLet them be so, you of this noble race.\nFor if my hands could reach them 1420\nI would believe they were mine just as when I had my sight.\n[Enter Antigone and Ismene]\nWhat is this?\nBefore the gods!\u2014Do I not hear those whom I love,\n406 Oedipus the King\nWeeping?

During this time period, the\ndifferent regions of China (each with a separate ruler and tradition) fought to maintain independence and defend\ntheir borders. In 221 B.C.E., the Qin\/Chin ruler finished the process of unifying China by the sword, becoming the\nfirst Emperor. These texts, therefore, predate the unification of China, and some of the advice offered (in particular\nin the works of Confucius) are meant to be seen in the context of multiple kingdoms; Confucius suggests leaving a\nkingdom and going elsewhere if the leadership is corrupt, which was no longer possible post-unification.\nThe works in this chapter are foundational texts to later Chinese literature, politics, and philosophy. The Ana-\nlects of Confucius, with its focus on ethical and moral issues, provides the reader with a guide to proper behavior\n(according to Confucius). The Shi king (The Book of Songs\/The Book of Odes\/The Classic of Poetry) may have been\nedited by Confucius, according to some sources, and the poems themselves offer a glimpse into the expectations of\nthat society. Daoism, the other influential perspective at that time, is found in the Zhuangzi (both a book and the\npossible name of the author), which offers a challenge to the Confucian way of thinking. Finally, Sun Tzu\u2019s Art of\nWar remains an influential text to this day, found as it is on the reading lists of military academies everywhere.\nStudents who are not familiar with Chinese literature and culture often have the same first problem: how to\npronounce the names. Chinese is a complex language, so the answer is not straightforward. In Chinese, words must\nbe pronounced using the proper tone. For example, the word \u201cma\u201d can be pronounced four different ways, and in\neach case it is a different word.\n\u2022 First tone: Rising tone (start low and go up the scale, like a rising accent mark)\n\u2022 Second tone: Falling tone (start high and drop lower, like a falling accent mark)\n\u2022 Third tone: Falling and Rising tone (begin high, drop low, and rise again, so that the sound is \u201cU\u201d shaped)\n\u2022 Fourth tone: Steady and High tone (high pitched, steady sound)\nSince each syllable of the word has a tone, and most translations do not mark which tone to use, there can be\nno way for students to know how to pronounce the word (except by taking a class in Chinese). Even then, students\nwould have to choose between a class on Mandarin (spoken in the north) and Cantonese (spoken in the south),\nsince they are too different to be taught as the same language. In addition to several major dialects of Chinese, there\nare numerous sub-dialects: some unintelligible to each other.\nAn additional challenge for students looking for research on these texts is that the same word can be spelled\ndifferently, depending on the pinyin system used. Pinyin is the way that Chinese characters are converted into let-\nters, so that the sound of the character is approximated. For example, the Chinese character for \u201cperson\u201d looks like a\ntype of wishbone, but it is converted to \u201cren\u201d in pinyin.\nThere are two major systems of pinyin (and some minor), and each one uses a different format to approximate\nsounds; both systems can be found online and in anthologies. The medieval Chinese poet Li Bo can be spelled Li Po\nor Li Bai, depending on the system used. In fact, the western name for \u201cChina\u201d results from a series of translations,\nbeginning with the pinyin \u201cChin\u201d (more commonly translated as \u201cQin\u201d these days) to describe the dynasty that\nunified the country in 221 B.C.E.; in other words, \u201cChina\u201d is the land of the Chin\/Qin.\nAs you read, consider the following questions:\n\u2022 What do Confucius and Sun Tzu expect from leaders? What is the proper behavior toward subordinates,\nand how do you know?\n441111 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u2022 How do Confucian ideals contrast with Daoist ideals? What seems to be the reason for the difference?\n\u2022 What kind of behavior does society expect from its people, particularly in the Shi king (Book of Songs)?\nHow do we know, based on the text?\n\u2022 What is the definition of heroism in these works, based on the texts themselves?\n\u2022 How would a Confucian hero be different from other ancient world heroes in other chapters, and why?\nWritten by Laura J. Getty\nTHE AnALECTS\nConfucius (551-479 B.C.E.)\nCompiled ca. 200 B.C.E.\nChina\nConfucius (or \u201cKongzi\u201d in Chinese) was deeply concerned about\nthe problem of social chaos and explored ways to achieve social order.\nInspired by the early rulers of the Zhou Dynasty (ca. 1045-256 B.C.E.),\nwhom he considered exemplary, Confucius developed his philosophy\nabout government, morality, ethics, social roles, and the importance of\nrituals. As a teacher, Confucius had a great number of disciples during his\ntime. The Analects, translated as \u201cCollected Conversations,\u201d were com-\nplied by later Confucian scholars, reaching their complete form around\nthe second century B.C.E.

There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confu-\nsion.\n\u201cThe superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally\ngrow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission,\u2014are they not the root of all benevolent actions?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cFine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.\u201d\nThe philosopher Tsang said, \u201cI daily examine myself on three points:\u2014whether, in transacting business for\nothers, I may have been not faithful;\u2014whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere;\u2014whether I\nmay have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cTo rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and\nsincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cA youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be\nearnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time\nand opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies.\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cIf a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of\n412 The Analects\nthe virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his\nlife; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:\u2014although men say that he has not learned, I will\ncertainly say that he has.\nThe Master said, \u201cIf the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid.\n\u201cHold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.\n\u201cHave no friends not equal to yourself.\n\u201cWhen you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\u201d\nThe philosopher Tsang said, \u201cLet there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let\nthem be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice;\u2014then the virtue of the people will resume its\nproper excellence.\u201d\nTsze-ch\u2019in asked Tsze-kung saying, \u201cWhen our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about\nits government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cOur master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his\ninformation. The master\u2019s mode of asking information,\u2014is it not different from that of other men?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhile a man\u2019s father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his\nconduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\u201d\nThe philosopher Yu said, \u201cIn practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways pre-\nscribed by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them.\n\u201cYet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without\nregulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done.\u201d\nThe philosopher Yu said, \u201cWhen agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made\ngood. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties\nupon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHe who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite,\nnor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his\nspeech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified:\u2014such a person may be said indeed\nto love to learn.\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cWhat do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man\nwho is not proud?\u201d The Master replied, \u201cThey will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheer-\nful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.\u201d\nTsze-kung replied, \u201cIt is said in the Book of Poetry, \u2018As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.\u2019\u2014The\nmeaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWith one like Ts\u2019ze, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its\nproper sequence.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI will not be afflicted at men\u2019s not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men.\u201d\n2\nThe Master said, \u201cHe who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar\nstar, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIn the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced\nin one sentence \u2018Having no depraved thoughts.\u2019\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they\nwill try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame.\n\u201cIf they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the\nsense of shame, and moreover will become good.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cAt fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning.\n\u201cAt thirty, I stood firm.\n\u201cAt forty, I had no doubts.\n\u201cAt fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.\n\u201cAt sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth.\n\u201cAt seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.\u201d\nMang I asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \u201cIt is not being disobedient.\u201d\nSoon after, as Fan Ch\u2019ih was driving him, the Master told him, saying, \u201cMang-sun asked me what filial piety\nwas, and I answered him,\u2014\u2018not being disobedient.\u2019\u201d\nFan Ch\u2019ih said, \u201cWhat did you mean?\u201d The Master replied, \u201cThat parents, when alive, be served according to\npropriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to\naccording to propriety.\u201d\n413 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nMang Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \u201cParents are anxious lest their children should be sick.\u201d\nTsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \u201cThe filial piety nowadays means the support of one\u2019s\nparents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something in the way of support;\u2014without reverence, what is\nthere to distinguish the one support given from the other?\u201d\nTsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \u201cThe difficulty is with the countenance. If, when their el-\nders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they\nset them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I\nsaid;\u2014as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have examined his conduct when away from me, and found him\nable to illustrate my teachings. Hui!\u2014He is not stupid.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cSee what a man does.\n\u201cMark his motives.\n\u201cExamine in what things he rests.\n\u201cHow can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be\na teacher of others.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe accomplished scholar is not a utensil.\u201d\nTsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \u201cHe acts before he speaks, and afterwards\nspeaks according to his actions.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cLearning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cYu, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it;\nand when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it;\u2014this is knowledge.\u201d\nTsze-chang was learning with a view to official emolument.\nThe Master said, \u201cHear much and put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously\nat the same time of the others:\u2014then you will afford few occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things\nwhich seem perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the others into practice: then you will\nhave few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions for\nrepentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument.\u201d\nThe Duke Ai asked, saying, \u201cWhat should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?\u201d Confucius\nreplied, \u201cAdvance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set\naside the upright, then the people will not submit.\u201d\nChi K\u2019ang asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve\nthemselves to virtue. The Master said, \u201cLet him preside over them with gravity;\u2014then they will reverence him. Let\nhim be final and kind to all;\u2014then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the good and teach the incompe-\ntent;\u2014then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous.\u201d\nSome one addressed Confucius, saying, \u201cSir, why are you not engaged in the government?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhat does the Shu-ching say of filial piety?\u2014\u2018You are final, you discharge your brotherly du-\nties. These qualities are displayed in government.\u2019 This then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must\nthere be THAT\u2014making one be in the government?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made\nto go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the hors-\nes?\u201d\nTsze-chang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after could be known.\nConfucius said, \u201cThe Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them\nmay be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may\nbe known. Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs\nmay be known.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cFor a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery.\n\u201cTo see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.\u201d\n3\nConfucius said of the head of the Chi family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, \u201cIf he can bear to\ndo this, what may he not bear to do?\u201d\nThe three families used the Yungode, while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice.\n414 The Analects\nThe Master said, \u201c\u2018Assisting are the princes;\u2014the son of heaven looks profound and grave\u2019;\u2014what application can\nthese words have in the hall of the three families?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propri-\nety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?\u201d\nLin Fang asked what was the first thing to be attended to in ceremonies.\nThe Master said, \u201cA great question indeed!\n\u201cIn festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better\nthat there be deep sorrow than in minute attention to observances.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe rude tribes of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States of our\ngreat land which are without them.\u201d\nThe chief of the Chi family was about to sacrifice to the T\u2019ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, \u201cCan you not\nsave him from this?\u201d He answered, \u201cI cannot.\u201d Confucius said, \u201cAlas! will you say that the T\u2019ai mountain is not so\ndiscerning as Lin Fang?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in\narchery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of\ndrinking. In his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.\u201d\nTsze-hsia asked, saying, \u201cWhat is the meaning of the passage\u2014\u2018The pretty dimples of her artful smile! The\nwell\u2014defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?\u2019\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe business of laying on the colors follows the preparation of the plain ground.\u201d\n\u201cCeremonies then are a subsequent thing?\u201d The Master said, \u201cIt is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I\ncan begin to talk about the odes with him.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI could describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my\nwords. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. They can-\nnot do so because of the insufficiency of their records and wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in\nsupport of my words.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cAt the great sacrifice, after the pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on.\u201d\nSome one asked the meaning of the great sacrifice. The Master said, \u201cI do not know. He who knew its meaning\nwould find it as easy to govern the kingdom as to look on this\u201d\u2014pointing to his palm.\nHe sacrificed to the dead, as if they were present. He sacrificed to the spirits, as if the spirits were present.\nThe Master said, \u201cI consider my not being present at the sacrifice, as if I did not sacrifice.\u201d\nWang-sun Chia asked, saying, \u201cWhat is the meaning of the saying, \u2018It is better to pay court to the furnace then\nto the southwest corner?\u2019\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cNot so. He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cChau had the advantage of viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are its\nregulations! I follow Chau.\u201d\nThe Master, when he entered the grand temple, asked about everything. Some one said, \u201cWho say that the son\nof the man of Tsau knows the rules of propriety! He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything.\u201d The\nMaster heard the remark, and said, \u201cThis is a rule of propriety.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIn archery it is not going through the leather which is the principal thing;\u2014because people\u2019s\nstrength is not equal. This was the old way.\u201d\nTsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of\neach month.\nThe Master said, \u201cTs\u2019ze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe full observance of the rules of propriety in serving one\u2019s prince is accounted by people to\nbe flattery.\u201d\nThe Duke Ting asked how a prince should employ his ministers, and how ministers should serve their prince.\nConfucius replied, \u201cA prince should employ his minister according to according to the rules of propriety; ministers\nshould serve their prince with faithfulness.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe Kwan Tsu is expressive of enjoyment without being licentious, and of grief without being\nhurtfully excessive.\u201d\nThe Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the altars of the spirits of the land. Tsai Wo replied, \u201cThe Hsia sovereign\nplanted the pine tree about them; the men of the Yin planted the cypress; and the men of the Chau planted the\nchestnut tree, meaning thereby to cause the people to be in awe.\u201d\nWhen the Master heard it, he said, \u201cThings that are done, it is needless to speak about; things that have had\ntheir course, it is needless to remonstrate about; things that are past, it is needless to blame.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cSmall indeed was the capacity of Kwan Chung!\u201d\nSome one said, \u201cWas Kwan Chung parsimonious?\u201d \u201cKwan,\u201d was the reply, \u201chad the San Kwei, and his officers\n415 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nperformed no double duties; how can he be considered parsimonious?\u201d\n\u201cThen, did Kwan Chung know the rules of propriety?\u201d The Master said, \u201cThe princes of States have a screen\nintercepting the view at their gates. Kwan had likewise a screen at his gate. The princes of States on any friendly\nmeeting between two of them, had a stand on which to place their inverted cups. Kwan had also such a stand. If\nKwan knew the rules of propriety, who does not know them?\u201d\nThe Master instructing the grand music master of Lu said, \u201cHow to play music may be known. At the com-\nmencement of the piece, all the parts should sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony while\nseverally distinct and flowing without break, and thus on to the conclusion.\u201d\nThe border warden at Yi requested to be introduced to the Master, saying, \u201cWhen men of superior virtue have\ncome to this, I have never been denied the privilege of seeing them.\u201d The followers of the sage introduced him, and\nwhen he came out from the interview, he said, \u201cMy friends, why are you distressed by your master\u2019s loss of office?\nThe kingdom has long been without the principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell\nwith its wooden tongue.\u201d\nThe Master said of the Shao that it was perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. He said of the Wu that it was\nperfectly beautiful but not perfectly good.\nThe Master said, \u201cHigh station filled without indulgent generosity; ceremonies performed without reverence;\nmourning conducted without sorrow;\u2014wherewith should I contemplate such ways?\u201d\n4\nThe Master said, \u201cIt is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man in select-\ning a residence do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThose who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hard-\nship, or in a condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIt is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cRiches and honors are what men desire. If they cannot be obtained in the proper way, they\nshould not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike. If they cannot be avoided in the proper way, they\nshould not be avoided.\n\u201cIf a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfill the requirements of that name?\n\u201cThe superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of haste, he\ncleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who\nloved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a\nway that he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person.\n\u201cIs any one able for one day to apply his strength to virtue? I have not seen the case in which his strength would\nbe insufficient.\n\u201cShould there possibly be any such case, I have not seen it.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man\u2019s\nfaults, it may be known that he is virtuous.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf a man in the morning hear the right way, he may die in the evening hear regret.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cA scholar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not\nfit to be discoursed with.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man, in the world, does not set his mind either for anything, or against any-\nthing; what is right he will follow.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort. The superior man thinks\nof the sanctions of law; the small man thinks of favors which he may receive.\u201d\nThe Master said: \u201cHe who acts with a constant view to his own advantage will be much murmured against.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf a prince is able to govern his kingdom with the complaisance proper to the rules of propri-\nety, what difficulty will he have? If he cannot govern it with that complaisance, what has he to do with the rules of\npropriety?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cA man should say, I am not concerned that I have no place, I am concerned how I may fit\nmyself for one. I am not concerned that I am not known, I seek to be worthy to be known.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cShan, my doctrine is that of an all-pervading unity.\u201d The disciple Tsang replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\nThe Master went out, and the other disciples asked, saying, \u201cWhat do his words mean?\u201d Tsang said, \u201cThe doc-\ntrine of our master is to be true to the principles\u2014of our nature and the benevolent exercise of them to others,\u2014\nthis and nothing more.\u201d\n416 The Analects\nThe Master said, \u201cThe mind of the superior man is conversant with righteousness; the mind of the mean man is\nconversant with gain.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen we see men of worth, we should think of equaling them; when we see men of a con-\ntrary character, we should turn inwards and examine ourselves.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIn serving his parents, a son may remonstrate with them, but gently; when he sees that they\ndo not incline to follow his advice, he shows an increased degree of reverence, but does not abandon his purpose;\nand should they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhile his parents are alive, the son may not go abroad to a distance. If he does go abroad, he\nmust have a fixed place to which he goes.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf the son for three years does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe years of parents may by no means not be kept in the memory, as an occasion at once for\njoy and for fear.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they\nfeared lest their actions should not come up to them.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe cautious seldom err.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cVirtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors.\u201d\nTsze-yu said, \u201cIn serving a prince, frequent remonstrances lead to disgrace. Between friends, frequent reproofs\nmake the friendship distant.\u201d\n5\nThe Master said of Kung-ye Ch\u2019ang that he might be wived; although he was put in bonds, he had not been\nguilty of any crime. Accordingly, he gave him his own daughter to wife.\nOf Nan Yung he said that if the country were well governed he would not be out of office, and if it were in gov-\nerned, he would escape punishment and disgrace. He gave him the daughter of his own elder brother to wife.\nThe Master said of Tsze-chien, \u201cOf superior virtue indeed is such a man! If there were not virtuous men in Lu,\nhow could this man have acquired this character?\u201d\nTsze-kung asked, \u201cWhat do you say of me, Ts\u2019ze!\u201d The Master said, \u201cYou are a utensil.\u201d \u201cWhat utensil?\u201d \u201cA\ngemmed sacrificial utensil.\u201d\nSome one said, \u201cYung is truly virtuous, but he is not ready with his tongue.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhat is the good of being ready with the tongue? They who encounter men with smartness\nof speech for the most part procure themselves hatred. I know not whether he be truly virtuous, but why should he\nshow readiness of the tongue?\u201d\nThe Master was wishing Ch\u2019i-tiao K\u2019ai to enter an official employment. He replied, \u201cI am not yet able to rest in\nthe assurance of this.\u201d The Master was pleased.\nThe Master said, \u201cMy doctrines make no way. I will get upon a raft, and float about on the sea. He that will\naccompany me will be Yu, I dare say.\u201d Tsze-lu hearing this was glad, upon which the Master said, \u201cYu is fonder of\ndaring than I am. He does not exercise his judgment upon matters.\u201d\nMang Wu asked about Tsze-lu, whether he was perfectly virtuous. The Master said, \u201cI do not know.\u201d\nHe asked again, when the Master replied, \u201cIn a kingdom of a thousand chariots, Yu might be employed to man-\nage the military levies, but I do not know whether he be perfectly virtuous.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you say of Ch\u2019iu?\u201d The Master replied, \u201cIn a city of a thousand families, or a clan of a hundred\nchariots, Ch\u2019iu might be employed as governor, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you say of Ch\u2019ih?\u201d The Master replied, \u201cWith his sash girt and standing in a court, Ch\u2019ih might be\nemployed to converse with the visitors and guests, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous.\u201d\nThe Master said to Tsze-kung, \u201cWhich do you consider superior, yourself or Hui?\u201d\nTsze-kung replied, \u201cHow dare I compare myself with Hui? Hui hears one point and knows all about a subject; I\nhear one point, and know a second.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cYou are not equal to him. I grant you, you are not equal to him.\u201d\nTsai Yu being asleep during the daytime, the Master said, \u201cRotten wood cannot be carved; a wall of dirty earth\nwill not receive the trowel. This Yu,\u2014what is the use of my reproving him?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cAt first, my way with men was to hear their words, and give them credit for their conduct.\nNow my way is to hear their words, and look at their conduct. It is from Yu that I have learned to make this change.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI have not seen a firm and unbending man.\u201d Some one replied, \u201cThere is Shan Ch\u2019ang.\u201d\n\u201cCh\u2019ang,\u201d said the Master, \u201cis under the influence of his passions; how can he be pronounced firm and unbending?\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cWhat I do not wish men to do to me, I also wish not to do to men.\u201d The Master said, \u201cTs\u2019ze,\n417 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nyou have not attained to that.\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cThe Master\u2019s personal displays of his principles and ordinary descriptions of them may be\nheard. His discourses about man\u2019s nature, and the way of Heaven, cannot be heard.\u201d\nWhen Tsze-lu heard anything, if he had not yet succeeded in carrying it into practice, he was only afraid lest he\nshould hear something else.\nTsze-kung asked, saying, \u201cOn what ground did Kung-wan get that title of Wan?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHe was of an active nature and yet fond of learning, and he was not ashamed to ask and learn\nof his inferiors!\u2014On these grounds he has been styled Wan.\u201d\nThe Master said of Tsze-ch\u2019an that he had four of the characteristics of a superior man\u2014in his conduct of him-\nself, he was humble; in serving his superior, he was respectful; in nourishing the people, he was kind; in ordering\nthe people, he was just.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cYen P\u2019ing knew well how to maintain friendly intercourse. The acquaintance might be long,\nbut he showed the same respect as at first.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cTsang Wan kept a large tortoise in a house, on the capitals of the pillars of which he had hills\nmade, and with representations of duckweed on the small pillars above the beams supporting the rafters.\u2014Of what\nsort was his wisdom?\u201d\nTsze-chang asked, saying, \u201cThe minister Tsze-wan thrice took office, and manifested no joy in his countenance.\nThrice he retired from office, and manifested no displeasure. He made it a point to inform the new minister of the\nway in which he had conducted the government; what do you say of him?\u201d The Master replied. \u201cHe was loyal.\u201d \u201cWas\nhe perfectly virtuous?\u201d \u201cI do not know. How can he be pronounced perfectly virtuous?\u201d\nTsze-chang proceeded, \u201cWhen the officer Ch\u2019ui killed the prince of Ch\u2019i, Ch\u2019an Wan, though he was the owner\nof forty horses, abandoned them and left the country. Coming to another state, he said, \u2018They are here like our great\nofficer, Ch\u2019ui,\u2019 and left it. He came to a second state, and with the same observation left it also;\u2014what do you say of\nhim?\u201d The Master replied, \u201cHe was pure.\u201d \u201cWas he perfectly virtuous?\u201d \u201cI do not know. How can he be pronounced\nperfectly virtuous?\u201d\nChi Wan thought thrice, and then acted. When the Master was informed of it, he said, \u201cTwice may do.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen good order prevailed in his country, Ning Wu acted the part of a wise man. When his\ncountry was in disorder, he acted the part of a stupid man. Others may equal his wisdom, but they cannot equal his\nstupidity.\u201d\nWhen the Master was in Ch\u2019an, he said, \u201cLet me return! Let me return! The little children of my school are am-\nbitious and too hasty. They are accomplished and complete so far, but they do not know how to restrict and shape\nthemselves.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cPo-i and Shu-ch\u2019i did not keep the former wickednesses of men in mind, and hence the re-\nsentments directed towards them were few.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWho says of Weishang Kao that he is upright? One begged some vinegar of him, and he\nbegged it of a neighbor and gave it to the man.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cFine words, an insinuating appearance, and excessive respect;\u2014Tso Ch\u2019iu-ming was ashamed\nof them. I also am ashamed of them. To conceal resentment against a person, and appear friendly with him;\u2014Tso\nCh\u2019iu-ming was ashamed of such conduct. I also am ashamed of it.\u201d\nYen Yuan and Chi Lu being by his side, the Master said to them, \u201cCome, let each of you tell his wishes.\u201d\nTsze-lu said, \u201cI should like, having chariots and horses, and light fur clothes, to share them with my friends, and\nthough they should spoil them, I would not be displeased.\u201d\nYen Yuan said, \u201cI should like not to boast of my excellence, nor to make a display of my meritorious deeds.\u201d\nTsze-lu then said, \u201cI should like, sir, to hear your wishes.\u201d The Master said, \u201cThey are, in regard to the aged, to\ngive them rest; in regard to friends, to show them sincerity; in regard to the young, to treat them tenderly.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIt is all over. I have not yet seen one who could perceive his faults, and inwardly accuse him-\nself.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIn a hamlet of ten families, there may be found one honorable and sincere as I am, but not so\nfond of learning.\u201d\n6\nThe Master said, \u201cThere is Yung!\u2014He might occupy the place of a prince.\u201d\nChung-kung asked about Tsze-sang Po-tsze. The Master said, \u201cHe may pass. He does not mind small matters.\u201d\nChung-kung said, \u201cIf a man cherish in himself a reverential feeling of the necessity of attention to business,\nthough he may be easy in small matters in his government of the people, that may be allowed. But if he cherish in\nhimself that easy feeling, and also carry it out in his practice, is not such an easymode of procedure excessive?\u201d\n418 The Analects\nThe Master said, \u201cYung\u2019s words are right.\u201d\nThe Duke Ai asked which of the disciples loved to learn.\nConfucius replied to him, \u201cThere was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. He did not transfer his anger; he did not re-\npeat a fault. Unfortunately, his appointed time was short and he died; and now there is not such another. I have not\nyet heard of any one who loves to learn as he did.\u201d\nTsze-hwa being employed on a mission to Ch\u2019i, the disciple Zan requested grain for his mother. The Master\nsaid, \u201cGive her a fu.\u201d Yen requested more. \u201cGive her a yi,\u201d said the Master. Yen gave her five ping.\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen Ch\u2019ih was proceeding to Ch\u2019i, he had fat horses to his carriage, and wore light furs. I\nhave heard that a superior man helps the distressed, but does not add to the wealth of the rich.\u201d\nYuan Sze being made governor of his town by the Master, he gave him nine hundred measures of grain, but Sze\ndeclined them.\nThe Master said, \u201cDo not decline them. May you not give them away in the neighborhoods, hamlets, towns, and\nvillages?\u201d\nThe Master, speaking of Chung-kung, said, \u201cIf the calf of a brindled cow be red and homed, although men may\nnot wish to use it, would the spirits of the mountains and rivers put it aside?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cSuch was Hui that for three months there would be nothing in his mind contrary to perfect\nvirtue. The others may attain to this on some days or in some months, but nothing more.\u201d\nChi K\u2019ang asked about Chung-yu, whether he was fit to be employed as an officer of government. The Master\nsaid, \u201cYu is a man of decision; what difficulty would he find in being an officer of government?\u201d K\u2019ang asked, \u201cIs\nTs\u2019ze fit to be employed as an officer of government?\u201d and was answered, \u201cTs\u2019ze is a man of intelligence; what diffi-\nculty would he find in being an officer of government?\u201d And to the same question about Ch\u2019iu the Master gave the\nsame reply, saying, \u201cCh\u2019iu is a man of various ability.\u201d\nThe chief of the Chi family sent to ask Min Tsze-ch\u2019ien to be governor of Pi. Min Tszech\u2019ien said, \u201cDecline the\noffer for me politely. If any one come again to me with a second invitation, I shall be obliged to go and live on the\nbanks of the Wan.\u201d\nPo-niu being ill, the Master went to ask for him. He took hold of his hand through the window, and said, \u201cIt is\nkilling him. It is the appointment of Heaven, alas! That such a man should have such a sickness! That such a man\nshould have such a sickness!\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cAdmirable indeed was the virtue of Hui! With a single bamboo dish of rice, a single gourd\ndish of drink, and living in his mean narrow lane, while others could not have endured the distress, he did not allow\nhis joy to be affected by it. Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui!\u201d\nYen Ch\u2019iu said, \u201cIt is not that I do not delight in your doctrines, but my strength is insufficient.\u201d The Master said,\n\u201cThose whose strength is insufficient give over in the middle of the way but now you limit yourself.\u201d\nThe Master said to Tsze-hsia, \u201cDo you be a scholar after the style of the superior man, and not after that of the\nmean man.\u201d\nTsze-yu being governor of Wu-ch\u2019ang, the Master said to him, \u201cHave you got good men there?\u201d He answered,\n\u201cThere is Tan-t\u2019ai Miehming, who never in walking takes a short cut, and never comes to my office, excepting on\npublic business.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cMang Chih-fan does not boast of his merit. Being in the rear on an occasion of flight, when\nthey were about to enter the gate, he whipped up his horse, saying, \u201cIt is not that I dare to be last. My horse would\nnot advance.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWithout the specious speech of the litanist T\u2019o and the beauty of the prince Chao of Sung, it is\ndifficult to escape in the present age.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWho can go out but by the door? How is it that men will not walk according to these ways?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhere the solid qualities are in excess of accomplishments, we have rusticity; where the ac-\ncomplishments are in excess of the solid qualities, we have the manners of a clerk. When the accomplishments and\nsolid qualities are equally blended, we then have the man of virtue.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cMan is born for uprightness. If a man lose his uprightness, and yet live, his escape from death\nis the effect of mere good fortune.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThey who know the truth are not equal to those who love it, and they who love it are not\nequal to those who delight in it.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cTo those whose talents are above mediocrity, the highest subjects may be announced. To\nthose who are below mediocrity, the highest subjects may not be announced.\u201d\nFan Ch\u2019ih asked what constituted wisdom. The Master said, \u201cTo give one\u2019s self earnestly to the duties due to\nmen, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.\u201d He asked about per-\nfect virtue. The Master said, \u201cThe man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first business, and success\nonly a subsequent consideration;\u2014this may be called perfect virtue.\u201d\n419 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThe Master said, \u201cThe wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous find pleasure in hills. The wise are active; the vir-\ntuous are tranquil. The wise are joyful; the virtuous are long-lived.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cCh\u2019i, by one change, would come to the State of Lu. Lu, by one change, would come to a State\nwhere true principles predominated.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cA cornered vessel without corners\u2014a strange cornered vessel! A strange cornered vessel!\u201d\nTsai Wo asked, saying, \u201cA benevolent man, though it be told him,\u2014\u2018There is a man in the well\u201d will go in after\nhim, I suppose.\u201d Confucius said, \u201cWhy should he do so?\u201d A superior man may be made to go to the well, but he\ncannot be made to go down into it. He may be imposed upon, but he cannot be fooled.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint\nof the rules of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right.\u201d\nThe Master having visited Nan-tsze, Tsze-lu was displeased, on which the Master swore, saying, \u201cWherein I\nhave done improperly, may Heaven reject me, may Heaven reject me!\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cPerfect is the virtue which is according to the Constant Mean! Rare for a long time has been\nits practice among the people.\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cSuppose the case of a man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to assist all,\nwhat would you say of him? Might he be called perfectly virtuous?\u201d The Master said, \u201cWhy speak only of virtue in\nconnection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this.\n\u201cNow the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be\nenlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.\n\u201cTo be able to judge of others by what is nigh in ourselves;\u2014this may be called the art of virtue.\u201d\n7\nThe Master said, \u201cA transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving the ancients, I venture to compare\nmyself with our old P\u2019ang.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe silent treasuring up of knowledge; learning without satiety; and instructing others with-\nout being wearied:\u2014which one of these things belongs to me?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe leaving virtue without proper cultivation; the not thoroughly discussing what is learned;\nnot being able to move towards righteousness of which a knowledge is gained; and not being able to change what is\nnot good:\u2014these are the things which occasion me solicitude.\u201d\nWhen the Master was unoccupied with business, his manner was easy, and he looked pleased.\nThe Master said, \u201cExtreme is my decay. For a long time, I have not dreamed, as I was wont to do, that I saw the\nduke of Chau.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cLet the will be set on the path of duty.\n\u201cLet every attainment in what is good be firmly grasped.\n\u201cLet perfect virtue be accorded with.\n\u201cLet relaxation and enjoyment be found in the polite arts.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cFrom the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh for my teaching upwards, I have never re-\nfused instruction to any one.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one\nwho is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot\nfrom it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.\u201d\nWhen the Master was eating by the side of a mourner, he never ate to the full.\nHe did not sing on the same day in which he had been weeping.\nThe Master said to Yen Yuan, \u201cWhen called to office, to undertake its duties; when not so called, to he retired;\u2014\nit is only I and you who have attained to this.\u201d\nTsze-lu said, \u201cIf you had the conduct of the armies of a great state, whom would you have to act with you?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI would not have him to act with me, who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without\na boat, dying without any regret. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is\nfond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf the search for riches is sure to be successful, though I should become a groom with whip in\nhand to get them, I will do so. As the search may not be successful, I will follow after that which I love.\u201d\nThe things in reference to which the Master exercised the greatest caution were\u2014fasting, war, and sickness.\nWhen the Master was in Ch\u2019i, he heard the Shao, and for three months did not know the taste of flesh. \u201cI did\nnot think\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cthat music could have been made so excellent as this.\u201d\nYen Yu said, \u201cIs our Master for the ruler of Wei?\u201d Tsze-kung said, \u201cOh! I will ask him.\u201d\nHe went in accordingly, and said, \u201cWhat sort of men were Po-i and Shu-ch\u2019i?\u201d \u201cThey were ancient worthies,\u201d\n420 The Analects\nsaid the Master. \u201cDid they have any repinings because of their course?\u201d The Master again replied, \u201cThey sought to\nact virtuously, and they did so; what was there for them to repine about?\u201d On this, Tsze-kung went out and said,\n\u201cOur Master is not for him.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWith coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bended arm for a pillow;\u2014I have still joy\nin the midst of these things. Riches and honors acquired by unrighteousness, are to me as a floating cloud.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf some years were added to my life, I would give fifty to the study of the Yi, and then I might\ncome to be without great faults.\u201d\nThe Master\u2019s frequent themes of discourse were\u2014the Odes, the History, and the maintenance of the Rules of\nPropriety. On all these he frequently discoursed.\nThe Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about Confucius, and Tsze-lu did not answer him.\nThe Master said, \u201cWhy did you not say to him,\u2014He is simply a man, who in his eager pursuit of knowledge for-\ngets his food, who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceive that old age is coming\non?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI am not one who was born in the possession of knowledge; I am one who is fond of antiqui-\nty, and earnest in seeking it there.\u201d\nThe subjects on which the Master did not talk, were\u2014extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and\nspiritual beings.\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good\nqualities and follow them, their bad qualities and avoid them.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHeaven produced the virtue that is in me. Hwan T\u2019ui\u2014what can he do to me?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cDo you think, my disciples, that I have any concealments? I conceal nothing from you. There\nis nothing which I do that is not shown to you, my disciples; that is my way.\u201d\nThere were four things which the Master taught,\u2014letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness.\nThe Master said, \u201cA sage it is not mine to see; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cA good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy\nme.\n\u201cHaving not and yet affecting to have, empty and yet affecting to be full, straitened and yet affecting to be at\nease:\u2014it is difficult with such characteristics to have constancy.\u201d\nThe Master angled,\u2014but did not use a net. He shot,\u2014but not at birds perching.\nThe Master said, \u201cThere may be those who act without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and select-\ning what is good and following it; seeing much and keeping it in memory: this is the second style of knowledge.\u201d\nIt was difficult to talk profitably and reputably with the people of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place having had\nan interview with the Master, the disciples doubted.\nThe Master said, \u201cI admit people\u2019s approach to me without committing myself as to what they may do when\nthey have retired. Why must one be so severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified,\nwithout guaranteeing his past conduct.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIs virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand.\u201d\nThe minister of crime of Ch\u2019an asked whether the duke Chao knew propriety, and Confucius said, \u201cHe knew\npropriety.\u201d\nConfucius having retired, the minister bowed to Wu-ma Ch\u2019i to come forward, and said, \u201cI have heard that\nthe superior man is not a partisan. May the superior man be a partisan also? The prince married a daughter of the\nhouse of WU, of the same surname with himself, and called her,\u2014\u2018The elder Tsze of Wu.\u2019 If the prince knew propri-\nety, who does not know it?\u201d\nWu-ma Ch\u2019i reported these remarks, and the Master said, \u201cI am fortunate! If I have any errors, people are sure\nto know them.\u201d\nWhen the Master was in company with a person who was singing, if he sang well, he would make him repeat\nthe song, while he accompanied it with his own voice.\nThe Master said, \u201cIn letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but the character of the superior man, carrying\nout in his conduct what he professes, is what I have not yet attained to.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe sage and the man of perfect virtue;\u2014how dare I rank myself with them? It may simply\nbe said of me, that I strive to become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness.\u201d Kung-hsi Hwa said,\n\u201cThis is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.\u201d\nThe Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked leave to pray for him. He said, \u201cMay such a thing be done?\u201d Tsze-\nlu replied, \u201cIt may. In the Eulogies it is said, \u2018Prayer has been made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower\nworlds.\u2019\u201d The Master said, \u201cMy praying has been for a long time.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cExtravagance leads to insubordination, and parsimony to meanness. It is better to be mean\nthan to be insubordinate.\u201d\n421 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man is satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of distress.\u201d\nThe Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy.\n8\nThe Master said, \u201cT\u2019ai-po may be said to have reached the highest point of virtuous action. Thrice he declined\nthe kingdom, and the people in ignorance of his motives could not express their approbation of his conduct.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cRespectfulness, without the rules of propriety, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, with-\nout the rules of propriety, becomes timidity; boldness, without the rules of propriety, becomes insubordination;\nstraightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes rudeness.\n\u201cWhen those who are in high stations perform well all their duties to their relations, the people are aroused to\nvirtue. When old friends are not neglected by them, the people are preserved from meanness.\u201d\nThe philosopher Tsang being ill, he cared to him the disciples of his school, and said, \u201cUncover my feet, uncov-\ner my hands. It is said in the Book of Poetry, \u2018We should be apprehensive and cautious, as if on the brink of a deep\ngulf, as if treading on thin ice, I and so have I been. Now and hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my\nperson. O ye, my little children.\u201d\nThe philosopher Tsang being ill, Meng Chang went to ask how he was.\nTsang said to him, \u201cWhen a bird is about to die, its notes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words\nare good.\n\u201cThere are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider specially important:\u2014that\nin his deportment and manner he keep from violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep\nnear to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as\nattending to the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.\u201d\nThe philosopher Tsang said, \u201cGifted with ability, and yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed\nof much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting\nhimself as empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; formerly I had a friend who pursued this\nstyle of conduct.\u201d\nThe philosopher Tsang said, \u201cSuppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a\nyoung orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergen-\ncy however great can drive from his principles:\u2014is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man indeed.\u201d\nThe philosopher Tsang said, \u201cThe officer may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. His\nburden is heavy and his course is long.\n\u201cPerfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain;\u2014is it not heavy? Only with death does his\ncourse stop;\u2014is it not long?\nThe Master said, \u201cIt is by the Odes that the mind is aroused.\n\u201cIt is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is established.\n\u201cIt is from Music that the finish is received.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand\nit.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe man who is fond of daring and is dissatisfied with poverty, will proceed to insubordina-\ntion. So will the man who is not virtuous, when you carry your dislike of him to an extreme.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThough a man have abilities as admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud\nand niggardly, those other things are really not worth being looked at.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIt is not easy to find a man who has learned for three years without coming to be good.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWith sincere faith he unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is perfecting the\nexcellence of his course.\n\u201cSuch an one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of govern-\nment prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep concealed.\n\u201cWhen a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country\nis ill governed, riches and honor are things to be ashamed of.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHe who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of\nits duties.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen the music master Chih first entered on his office, the finish of the Kwan Tsu was mag-\nnificent;\u2014how it filled the ears!\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cArdent and yet not upright, stupid and yet not attentive; simple and yet not sincere:\u2014such\npersons I do not understand.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cLearn as if you could not reach your object, and were always fearing also lest you should lose\n422 The Analects\nit.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHow majestic was the manner in which Shun and Yu held possession of the empire, as if it\nwere nothing to them!\nThe Master said, \u201cGreat indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand,\nand only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it.\n\u201cHow majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he\ninstituted!\u201d\nShun had five ministers, and the empire was well governed.\nKing Wu said, \u201cI have ten able ministers.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cIs not the saying that talents are difficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of T\u2019ang and\nYu met, were they more abundant than in this of Chau, yet there was a woman among them. The able ministers\nwere no more than nine men.\n\u201cKing Wan possessed two of the three parts of the empire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The\nvirtue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the highest point indeed.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI can find no flaw in the character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but dis-\nplayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost\nelegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low, mean house, but expended all his strength on the ditches\nand water channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu.\u201d\n9\nThe subjects of which the Master seldom spoke were\u2014profitableness, and also the appointments of Heaven,\nand perfect virtue.\nA man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, \u201cGreat indeed is the philosopher K\u2019ung! His learning is extensive, and\nyet he does not render his name famous by any particular thing.\u201d\nThe Master heard the observation, and said to his disciples, \u201cWhat shall I practice? Shall I practice charioteer-\ning, or shall I practice archery? I will practice charioteering.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe linen cap is that prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is worn. It is\neconomical, and I follow the common practice.\n\u201cThe rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the hall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending\nit. That is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose the common practice.\u201d\nThere were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary\npredeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.\nThe Master was put in fear in K\u2019wang.\nHe said, \u201cAfter the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me?\n\u201cIf Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such a rela-\ntion to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of K\u2019wang do to me?\u201d\nA high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, \u201cMay we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cCertainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability\nis various.\u201d\nThe Master heard of the conversation and said, \u201cDoes the high officer know me? When I was young, my con-\ndition was low, and I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have\nsuch variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability. Lao said, \u201cThe Master said, \u2018Having no official employ-\nment, I acquired many arts.\u2019\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cAm I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears\nquite empty\u2014like, ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe Fang bird does not come; the river sends forth no map:\u2014it is all over with me!\u201d\nWhen the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments of\nfull dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he would rise\nup, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily.\nYen Yuan, in admiration of the Master\u2019s doctrines, sighed and said, \u201cI looked up to them, and they seemed\nto become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me,\nand suddenly they seemed to be behind.\n\u201cThe Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me\nthe restraints of propriety.\n\u201cWhen I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there\nseems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to\n423 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ndo so.\u201d\nThe Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him.\nDuring a remission of his illness, he said, \u201cLong has the conduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have\nministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven?\n\u201cMoreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you,\nmy disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cThere is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a\ngood price and sell it?\u201d The Master said, \u201cSell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to offer the price.\u201d\nThe Master was wishing to go and live among the nine wild tribes of the east.\nSome one said, \u201cThey are rude. How can you do such a thing?\u201d The Master said, \u201cIf a superior man dwelt\namong them, what rudeness would there be?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI returned from Wei to Lu, and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal\nsongs and Praise songs all found their proper places.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cAbroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one\u2019s father and elder broth-\ners; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one\u2019s self; and not to be overcome of wine:\u2014which one of these\nthings do I attain to?\u201d\nThe Master standing by a stream, said, \u201cIt passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe prosecution of learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound. If\nthere want but one basket of earth to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may be com-\npared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful is thrown at a time, the advancing\nwith it my own going forward.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cNever flagging when I set forth anything to him;\u2014ah! that is Hui.\u201d The Master said of Yen\nYuan, \u201cAlas! I saw his constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThere are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are\ncases where it flowers but fruit is not subsequently produced!\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cA youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal\nto our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be\nworth being regarded with respect.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cCan men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct\nbecause of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding\ntheir aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their aim, and assents to\nthose, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself.\nWhen you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a com-\nmon man cannot be taken from him.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cDressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of men dressed\nin furs, and not ashamed;\u2014ah! it is Yu who is equal to this!\n\u201cHe dislikes none, he covets nothing;\u2014what can he do but what is good!\u201d\nTsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the ode, when the Master said, \u201cThose things are by no means\nsufficient to constitute perfect excellence.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen the year becomes cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last to lose\ntheir leaves.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThere are some with whom we may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go\nalong with us to principles. Perhaps we may go on with them to principles, but we shall find them unable to get\nestablished in those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with them, we shall find them unable to\nweigh occurring events along with us.\u201d\n\u201cHow the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIt is the want of thought about it. How is it distant?\u201d\n10\nConfucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere, and as if he were not able to speak.\nWhen he was in the prince\u2019s ancestral temple, or in the court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.\nWhen he was waiting at court, in speaking with the great officers of the lower grade, he spoke freely, but in a\n424 The Analects\nstraightforward manner; in speaking with those of the higher grade, he did so blandly, but precisely.\nWhen the ruler was present, his manner displayed respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.\nWhen the prince called him to employ him in the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to change,\nand his legs to move forward with difficulty.\nHe inclined himself to the other officers among whom he stood, moving his left or right arm, as their position\nrequired, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted.\nHe hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a bird.\nWhen the guest had retired, he would report to the prince, \u201cThe visitor is not turning round any more.\u201d\nWhen he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him.\nWhen he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of the gateway; when he passed in or out, he did not tread\nupon the threshold.\nWhen he was passing the vacant place of the prince, his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend\nunder him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter them.\nHe ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his\nbreath also, as if he dared not breathe.\nWhen he came out from the audience, as soon as he had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance,\nand had a satisfied look. When he had got the bottom of the steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms\nlike wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful uneasiness.\nWhen he was carrying the scepter of his ruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to bear its\nweight. He did not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making a bow, nor lower than their position\nin giving anything to another. His countenance seemed to change, and look apprehensive, and he dragged his feet\nalong as if they were held by something to the ground.\nIn presenting the presents with which he was charged, he wore a placid appearance.\nAt his private audience, he looked highly pleased.\nThe superior man did not use a deep purple, or a puce color, in the ornaments of his dress.\nEven in his undress, he did not wear anything of a red or reddish color.\nIn warm weather, he had a single garment either of coarse or fine texture, but he wore it displayed over an inner\ngarment.\nOver lamb\u2019s fur he wore a garment of black; over fawn\u2019s fur one of white; and over fox\u2019s fur one of yellow.\nThe fur robe of his undress was long, with the right sleeve short.\nHe required his sleeping dress to be half as long again as his body.\nWhen staying at home, he used thick furs of the fox or the badger.\nWhen he put off mourning, he wore all the appendages of the girdle.\nHis undergarment, except when it was required to be of the curtain shape, was made of silk cut narrow above\nand wide below.\nHe did not wear lamb\u2019s fur or a black cap on a visit of condolence.\nOn the first day of the month he put on his court robes, and presented himself at court.\nWhen fasting, he thought it necessary to have his clothes brightly clean and made of linen cloth.\nWhen fasting, he thought it necessary to change his food, and also to change the place where he commonly sat\nin the apartment.\nHe did not dislike to have his rice finely cleaned, nor to have his mince meat cut quite small.\nHe did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was gone.\nHe did not eat what was discolored, or what was of a bad flavor, nor anything which was ill-cooked, or was not in\nseason.\nHe did not eat meat which was not cut properly, nor what was served without its proper sauce.\nThough there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allow what he took to exceed the due proportion\nfor the rice. It was only in wine that he laid down no limit for himself, but he did not allow himself to be confused\nby it.\nHe did not partake of wine and dried meat bought in the market.\nHe was never without ginger when he ate. He did not eat much.\nWhen he had been assisting at the prince\u2019s sacrifice, he did not keep the flesh which he received overnight. The\nflesh of his family sacrifice he did not keep over three days. If kept over three days, people could not eat it.\nWhen eating, he did not converse. When in bed, he did not speak.\nAlthough his food might be coarse rice and vegetable soup, he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave,\nrespectful air.\nIf his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.\nWhen the villagers were drinking together, upon those who carried staffs going out, he also went out immedi-\n425 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nately after.\nWhen the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive away pestilential influences, he put on his\ncourt robes and stood on the eastern steps.\nWhen he was sending complimentary inquiries to any one in another state, he bowed twice as he escorted the\nmessenger away.\nChi K\u2019ang having sent him a present of physic, he bowed and received it, saying, \u201cI do not know it. I dare not\ntaste it.\u201d\nThe stable being burned down, when he was at court, on his return he said, \u201cHas any man been hurt?\u201d He did\nnot ask about the horses.\nWhen the he would adjust his mat, first taste it, and then give it away to others. When the prince sent him a gift\nof undressed meat, he would have it cooked, and offer it to the spirits of his ancestors. When the prince sent him a\ngift of a living animal, he would keep it alive.\nWhen he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment, the prince only sacrificed. He first\ntasted everything.\nWhen he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be spread\nover him, and drew his girdle across them.\nWhen the prince\u2019s order called him, without waiting for his carriage to be yoked, he went at once.\nWhen he entered the ancestral temple of the state, he asked about everything.\nWhen any of his friends died, if he had no relations offices, he would say, \u201cI will bury him.\u201d\nWhen a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and horses, he did not bow.\nThe only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice.\nIn bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he did not put on any formal deportment.\nWhen he saw any one in a mourning dress, though it might be an acquaintance, he would change countenance;\nwhen he saw any one wearing the cap of full dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his undress, he would\nsalute him in a ceremonious manner.\nTo any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of his carriage; he bowed in the same way to any\none bearing the tables of population.\nWhen he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisions set before him, he would change\ncountenance and rise up.\nOn a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change countenance.\nWhen he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight, holding the cord.\nWhen he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not point with\nhis hands.\nSeeing the countenance, it instantly rises. It flies round, and by and by settles.\nThe Master said, \u201cThere is the hen-pheasant on the hill bridge. At its season! At its season!\u201d Tsze-lu made a\nmotion to it. Thrice it smelt him and then rose.\n11\nThe Master said, \u201cThe men of former times in the matters of ceremonies and music were rustics, it is said, while\nthe men of these latter times, in ceremonies and music, are accomplished gentlemen.\n\u201cIf I have occasion to use those things, I follow the men of former times.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cOf those who were with me in Ch\u2019an and Ts\u2019ai, there are none to be found to enter my door.\u201d\nDistinguished for their virtuous principles and practice, there were Yen Yuan, Min Tsze-ch\u2019ien, Zan Po-niu, and\nChung-kung; for their ability in speech, Tsai Wo and Tsze-kung; for their administrative talents, Zan Yu and Chi\nLu; for their literary acquirements, Tsze-yu and Tsze-hsia.\nThe Master said, \u201cHui gives me no assistance. There is nothing that I say in which he does not delight.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cFilial indeed is Min Tsze-ch\u2019ien! Other people say nothing of him different from the report of\nhis parents and brothers.\u201d\nNan Yung was frequently repeating the lines about a white scepter stone. Confucius gave him the daughter of\nhis elder brother to wife.\nChi K\u2019ang asked which of the disciples loved to learn. Confucius replied to him, \u201cThere was Yen Hui; he loved\nto learn. Unfortunately his appointed time was short, and he died. Now there is no one who loves to learn, as he\ndid.\u201d\nWhen Yen Yuan died, Yen Lu begged the carriage of the Master to sell and get an outer shell for his son\u2019s coffin.\nThe Master said, \u201cEvery one calls his son his son, whether he has talents or has not talents. There was Li; when\nhe died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to get a shell for him, because, having followed\n426 The Analects\nin the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I should walk on foot.\u201d\nWhen Yen Yuan died, the Master said, \u201cAlas! Heaven is destroying me! Heaven is destroying me!\u201d\nWhen Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said, \u201cMaster,\nyour grief is excessive!\u201d\n\u201cIs it excessive?\u201d said he. \u201cIf I am not to mourn bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?\u201d\nWhen Yen Yuan died, the disciples wished to give him a great funeral, and the Master said, \u201cYou may not do\nso.\u201d\nThe disciples did bury him in great style.\nThe Master said, \u201cHui behaved towards me as his father. I have not been able to treat him as my son. The fault is\nnot mine; it belongs to you, O disciples.\u201d\nChi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master said, \u201cWhile you are not able to serve men, how\ncan you serve their spirits?\u201d Chi Lu added, \u201cI venture to ask about death?\u201d He was answered, \u201cWhile you do not\nknow life, how can you know about death?\u201d\nThe disciple Min was standing by his side, looking bland and precise; Tsze-lu, looking bold and soldierly; Zan\nYu and Tsze-kung, with a free and straightforward manner. The Master was pleased.\nHe said, \u201cYu, there!\u2014he will not die a natural death.\u201d\nSome parties in Lu were going to take down and rebuild the Long Treasury.\nMin Tsze-ch\u2019ien said, \u201cSuppose it were to be repaired after its old style;\u2014why must it be altered and made\nanew?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThis man seldom speaks; when he does, he is sure to hit the point.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhat has the lute of Yu to do in my door?\u201d\nThe other disciples began not to respect Tszelu. The Master said, \u201cYu has ascended to the hall, though he has\nnot yet passed into the inner apartments.\u201d\nTsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior. The Master said, \u201cShih goes beyond the due\nmean, and Shang does not come up to it.\u201d\n\u201cThen,\u201d said Tsze-kung, \u201cthe superiority is with Shih, I suppose.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cTo go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.\u201d\nThe head of the Chi family was richer than the duke of Chau had been, and yet Ch\u2019iu collected his imposts for\nhim, and increased his wealth.\nThe Master said, \u201cHe is no disciple of mine. My little children, beat the drum and assail him.\u201d\nCh\u2019ai is simple. Shan is dull. Shih is specious. Yu is coarse.\nThe Master said, \u201cThere is Hui! He has nearly attained to perfect virtue. He is often in want.\n\u201cTs\u2019ze does not acquiesce in the appointments of Heaven, and his goods are increased by him. Yet his judg-\nments are often correct.\u201d\nTsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, \u201cHe does not tread in the\nfootsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf, because a man\u2019s discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he\nreally a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?\u201d\nTsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, \u201cThere are\nyour father and elder brothers to be consulted;\u2014why should you act on that principle of immediately carrying into\npractice what you hear?\u201d Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard,\nand the Master answered, \u201cImmediately carry into practice what you hear.\u201d Kung-hsi Hwa said, \u201cYu asked whether\nhe should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, \u2018There are your father and elder brothers to\nbe consulted.\u2019 Ch\u2019iu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and you said, \u2018Carry\nit immediately into practice.\u2019 I, Ch\u2019ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.\u201d The Master said,\n\u201cCh\u2019iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has more than his own share of energy; therefore I\nkept him back.\u201d\nThe Master was put in fear in K\u2019wang and Yen Yuan fell behind. The Master, on his rejoining him, said, \u201cI\nthought you had died.\u201d Hui replied, \u201cWhile you were alive, how should I presume to die?\u201d\nChi Tsze-zan asked whether Chung Yu and Zan Ch\u2019iu could be called great ministers.\nThe Master said, \u201cI thought you would ask about some extraordinary individuals, and you only ask about Yu\nand Ch\u2019iu!\n\u201cWhat is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince according to what is right, and when he finds he\ncannot do so, retires.\n\u201cNow, as to Yu and Ch\u2019iu, they may be called ordinary ministers.\u201d\nTsze-zan said, \u201cThen they will always follow their chief;\u2014win they?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIn an act of parricide or regicide, they would not follow him.\u201d\n427 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nTsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor of Pi.\nThe Master said, \u201cYou are injuring a man\u2019s son.\u201d\nTsze-lu said, \u201cThere are, there, common people and officers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and\ngrain. Why must one read books before he can be considered to have learned?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIt is on this account that I hate your glib-tongued people.\u201d\nTsze-lu, Tsang Hsi, Zan Yu, and Kunghsi Hwa were sitting by the Master.\nHe said to them, \u201cThough I am a day or so older than you, do not think of that.\n\u201cFrom day to day you are saying, \u2018We are not known.\u2019 If some ruler were to know you, what would you like to\ndo?\u201d\nTsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, \u201cSuppose the case of a state of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened be-\ntween other large cities; let it be suffering from invading armies; and to this let there be added a famine in corn and\nin all vegetables:\u2014if I were intrusted with the government of it, in three years\u2019 time I could make the people to be\nbold, and to recognize the rules of righteous conduct.\u201d The Master smiled at him.\nTurning to Yen Yu, he said, \u201cCh\u2019iu, what are your wishes?\u201d Ch\u2019iu replied, \u201cSuppose a state of sixty or seventy li\nsquare, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government of it;\u2014in three years\u2019 time, I could make plenty to\nabound among the people. As to teaching them the principles of propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a\nsuperior man to do that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are your wishes, Ch\u2019ih,\u201d said the Master next to Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch\u2019ih replied, \u201cI do not say that my ability\nextends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple, and at the audienc-\nes of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark square-made robe and the black linen cap, to\nact as a small assistant.\u201d\nLast of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, \u201cTien, what are your wishes?\u201d Tien, pausing as he was playing on his\nlute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and \u201cMy wishes,\u201d he said, \u201care different from the cherished\npurposes of these three gentlemen.\u201d \u201cWhat harm is there in that?\u201d said the Master; \u201cdo you also, as well as they,\nspeak out your wishes.\u201d Tien then said, \u201cIn this, the last month of spring, with the dress of the season all complete,\nalong with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the\nbreeze among the rain altars, and return home singing.\u201d The Master heaved a sigh and said, \u201cI give my approval to\nTien.\u201d\nThe three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained behind, and said, \u201cWhat do you think of the words of\nthese three friends?\u201d The Master replied, \u201cThey simply told each one his wishes.\u201d\nHsi pursued, \u201cMaster, why did you smile at Yu?\u201d\nHe was answered, \u201cThe management of a state demands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble;\ntherefore I smiled at him.\u201d\nHsi again said, \u201cBut was it not a state which Ch\u2019iu proposed for himself?\u201d The reply was, \u201cYes; did you ever see a\nterritory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which was not a state?\u201d\nOnce more, Hsi inquired, \u201cAnd was it not a state which Ch\u2019ih proposed for himself?\u201d The Master again replied,\n\u201cYes; who but princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with audiences but the sovereign? If Ch\u2019ih were to be a\nsmall assistant in these services, who could be a great one?\n12\nYen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \u201cTo subdue one\u2019s self and return to propriety, is perfect\nvirtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will ascribe perfect virtue\nto him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?\u201d\nYen Yuan said, \u201cI beg to ask the steps of that process.\u201d The Master replied, \u201cLook not at what is contrary to\npropriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement\nwhich is contrary to propriety.\u201d Yen Yuan then said, \u201cThough I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it\nmy business to practice this lesson.\u201d\nChung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \u201cIt is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one\nas if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to\nothers as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the country, and none in the\nfamily.\u201d Chung-kung said, \u201cThough I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice\nthis lesson.\u201d\nSze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue.\nThe Master said, \u201cThe man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in his speech.\u201d\n\u201cCautious and slow in his speech!\u201d said Niu;\u2014\u201dis this what is meant by perfect virtue?\u201d The Master said, \u201cWhen\na man feels the difficulty of doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?\u201d\n428 The Analects\nSze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, \u201cThe superior man has neither anxiety nor fear.\u201d\n\u201cBeing without anxiety or fear!\u201d said Nui;\u201ddoes this constitute what we call the superior man?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen internal examination discovers nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what\nis there to fear?\u201d\nSze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, \u201cOther men all have their brothers, I only have not.\u201d\nTsze-hsia said to him, \u201cThere is the following saying which I have heard\u2014\u2018Death and life have their determined\nappointment; riches and honors depend upon Heaven.\u2019\n\u201cLet the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and\nobservant of propriety:\u2014then all within the four seas will be his brothers. What has the superior man to do with\nbeing distressed because he has no brothers?\u201d\nTsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, \u201cHe with whom neither slander that gradually\nsoaks into the mind, nor statements that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may be called intelligent in-\ndeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.\u201d\nTsze-kung asked about government. The Master said, \u201cThe requisites of government are that there be sufficien-\ncy of food, sufficiency of military equipment, and the confidence of the people in their ruler.\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cIf it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be\nforegone first?\u201d \u201cThe military equipment,\u201d said the Master.\nTsze-kung again asked, \u201cIf it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which\nof them should be foregone?\u201d The Master answered, \u201cPart with the food. From of old, death has been the lot of an\nmen; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.\u201d\nChi Tsze-ch\u2019ang said, \u201cIn a superior man it is only the substantial qualities which are wanted;\u2014why should we\nseek for ornamental accomplishments?\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cAlas! Your words, sir, show you to be a superior man, but four horses cannot overtake the\ntongue. Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is\nlike the hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.\u201d\nThe Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, \u201cThe year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not\nsufficient;\u2014what is to be done?\u201d\nYu Zo replied to him, \u201cWhy not simply tithe the people?\u201d\n\u201cWith two tenths, said the duke, \u201cI find it not enough;\u2014how could I do with that system of one tenth?\u201d\nYu Zo answered, \u201cIf the people have plenty, their prince will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want,\ntheir prince cannot enjoy plenty alone.\u201d\nTsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, \u201cHold\nfaithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be moving continually to what is right,\u2014this is the way to exalt\none\u2019s virtue.\n\u201cYou love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also\nwish him to die. This is a case of delusion. \u2018It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you come to make a\ndifference.\u2019\u201d\nThe Duke Ching, of Ch\u2019i, asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, \u201cThere is government, when\nthe prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son.\u201d\n\u201cGood!\u201d said the duke; \u201cif, indeed, the prince be not prince, the not minister, the father not father, and the son\nnot son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cAh! it is Yu, who could with half a word settle litigations!\u201d\nTsze-lu never slept over a promise.\nThe Master said, \u201cIn hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause the\npeople to have no litigations.\u201d\nTsze-chang asked about government. The Master said, \u201cThe art of governing is to keep its affairs before the\nmind without weariness, and to practice them with undeviating consistency.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cBy extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of\npropriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to per-\nfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this.\u201d\nChi K\u2019ang asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, \u201cTo govern means to rectify. If you lead on\nthe people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?\u201d\nChi K\u2019ang, distressed about the number of thieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with\nthem. Confucius said, \u201cIf you, sir, were not covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would not\nsteal.\u201d\nChi K\u2019ang asked Confucius about government, saying, \u201cWhat do you say to killing the unprincipled for the\n429 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ngood of the principled?\u201d Confucius replied, \u201cSir, in carrying on your government, why should you use killing at\nall? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will be good. The relation between superiors and\ninferiors is like that between the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows across it.\u201d\nTsze-chang asked, \u201cWhat must the officer be, who may be said to be distinguished?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhat is it you call being distinguished?\u201d\nTsze-chang replied, \u201cIt is to be heard of through the state, to be heard of throughout his clan.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThat is notoriety, not distinction.\n\u201cNow the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves righteousness. He examines people\u2019s words,\nand looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the\ncountry; he will be distinguished in his clan.\n\u201cAs to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests\nin this character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of\nin the clan.\u201d\nFan Ch\u2019ih rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain altars, said, \u201cI venture to ask how to exalt\nvirtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover delusions.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cTruly a good question!\n\u201cIf doing what is to be done be made the first business, and success a secondary consideration:\u2014is not this\nthe way to exalt virtue? To assail one\u2019s own wickedness and not assail that of others;\u2014is not this the way to correct\ncherished evil? For a morning\u2019s anger to disregard one\u2019s own life, and involve that of his parents;\u2014is not this a case\nof delusion?\u201d\nFan Ch\u2019ih asked about benevolence. The Master said, \u201cIt is to love all men.\u201d He asked about knowledge. The\nMaster said, \u201cIt is to know all men.\u201d\nFan Ch\u2019ih did not immediately understand these answers.\nThe Master said, \u201cEmploy the upright and put aside all the crooked; in this way the crooked can be made to be\nupright.\u201d\nFan Ch\u2019ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, \u201cA Little while ago, I had an interview with our Mas-\nter, and asked him about knowledge. He said, \u2018Employ the upright, and put aside all the crooked;\u2014in this way, the\ncrooked will be made to be upright.\u2019 What did he mean?\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cTruly rich is his saying!\n\u201cShun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed Kai-yao-on\nwhich all who were devoid of virtue disappeared. T\u2019ang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among\nall the people, and employed I Yin-and an who were devoid of virtue disappeared.\u201d\nTsze-kung asked about friendship. The Master said, \u201cFaithfully admonish your friend, and skillfully lead him\non. If you find him impracticable, stop. Do not disgrace yourself.\u201d\nThe philosopher Tsang said, \u201cThe superior man on grounds of culture meets with his friends, and by friendship\nhelps his virtue.\u201d\n13\nTsze-lu asked about government. The Master said, \u201cGo before the people with your example, and be laborious\nin their affairs.\u201d\nHe requested further instruction, and was answered, \u201cBe not weary in these things.\u201d\nChung-kung, being chief minister to the head of the Chi family, asked about government. The Master said,\n\u201cEmploy first the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, and raise to office men of virtue and talents.\u201d\nChung-kung said, \u201cHow shall I know the men of virtue and talent, so that I may raise them to office?\u201d He was\nanswered, \u201cRaise to office those whom you know. As to those whom you do not know, will others neglect them?\u201d\nTsze-lu said, \u201cThe ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What\nwill you consider the first thing to be done?\u201d\nThe Master replied, \u201cWhat is necessary is to rectify names.\u201d\n\u201cSo! indeed!\u201d said Tsze-lu. \u201cYou are wide of the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHow uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a\ncautious reserve.\n\u201cIf names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accor-\ndance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success.\n\u201cWhen affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. When proprieties and\nmusic do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded,\nthe people do not know how to move hand or foot.\n430 The Analects\n\u201cTherefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also\nthat what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there\nmay be nothing incorrect.\u201d\nFan Ch\u2019ih requested to be taught husbandry. The Master said, \u201cI am not so good for that as an old husband-\nman.\u201d He requested also to be taught gardening, and was answered, \u201cI am not so good for that as an old gardener.\u201d\nFan Ch\u2019ih having gone out, the Master said, \u201cA small man, indeed, is Fan Hsu! If a superior man love propriety,\nthe people will not dare not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not dare not to submit to his\nexample. If he love good faith, the people will not dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things obtain, the people\nfrom all quarters will come to him, bearing their children on their backs; what need has he of a knowledge of hus-\nbandry?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThough a man may be able to recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a gov-\nernmental charge, he knows not how to act, or if, when sent to any quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies\nunassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is it?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen a prince\u2019s personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without the issuing of\norders. If his personal conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be followed.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.\u201d\nThe Master said of Ching, a scion of the ducal family of Wei, that he knew the economy of a family well. When\nhe began to have means, he said, \u201cHa! here is a collection\u2014!\u201d When they were a little increased, he said, \u201cHa! this is\ncomplete!\u201d When he had become rich, he said, \u201cHa! this is admirable!\u201d\nWhen the Master went to Weil Zan Yu acted as driver of his carriage.\nThe Master observed, \u201cHow numerous are the people!\u201d\nYu said, \u201cSince they are thus numerous, what more shall be done for them?\u201d \u201cEnrich them, was the reply.\n\u201cAnd when they have been enriched, what more shall be done?\u201d The Master said, \u201cTeach them.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf there were any of the princes who would employ me, in the course of twelve months, I\nshould have done something considerable. In three years, the government would be perfected.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201c\u2018If good men were to govern a country in succession for a hundred years, they would be able\nto transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital punishments.\u2019 True indeed is this saying!\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf a truly royal ruler were to arise, it would stir require a generation, and then virtue would\nprevail.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf a minister make his own conduct correct, what difficulty will he have in assisting in govern-\nment? If he cannot rectify himself, what has he to do with rectifying others?\u201d\nThe disciple Zan returning from the court, the Master said to him, \u201cHow are you so late?\u201d He replied, \u201cWe had\ngovernment business.\u201d The Master said, \u201cIt must have been family affairs. If there had been government business,\nthough I am not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.\u201d\nThe Duke Ting asked whether there was a single sentence which could make a country prosperous. Confucius\nreplied, \u201cSuch an effect cannot be expected from one sentence.\n\u201cThere is a saying, however, which people have \u2014\u2018To be a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy.\u2019\n\u201cIf a ruler knows this,\u2014the difficulty of being a prince,\u2014may there not be expected from this one sentence the\nprosperity of his country?\u201d\nThe duke then said, \u201cIs there a single sentence which can ruin a country?\u201d Confucius replied, \u201cSuch an effect as\nthat cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have\u2014\u2018I have no pleasure in\nbeing a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say!\u2019\n\u201cIf a ruler\u2019s words be good, is it not also good that no one oppose them? But if they are not good, and no one\nopposes them, may there not be expected from this one sentence the ruin of his country?\u201d\nThe Duke of Sheh asked about government.\nThe Master said, \u201cGood government obtains when those who are near are made happy, and those who are far\noff are attracted.\u201d\nTsze-hsia! being governor of Chu-fu, asked about government. The Master said, \u201cDo not be desirous to have\nthings done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done\nthoroughly. Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished.\u201d\nThe Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, saying, \u201cAmong us here there are those who may be styled upright in\ntheir conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, they will bear witness to the fact.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cAmong us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are different from this. The father\nconceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found\nin this.\u201d\nFan Ch\u2019ih asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \u201cIt is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the man-\nagement of business, to be reverently attentive; in intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere. Though a man go\n431 Compact Anthology of World Literature\namong rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected.\u201d\nTsze-kung asked, saying, \u201cWhat qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The Master\nsaid, \u201cHe who in his conduct of himself maintains a sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace\nhis prince\u2019s commission, deserves to be called an officer.\u201d\nTsze-kung pursued, \u201cI venture to ask who may be placed in the next lower rank?\u201d And he was told, \u201cHe whom\nthe circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow villagers and neighbors pronounce to be fraternal.\u201d\nAgain the disciple asked, \u201cI venture to ask about the class still next in order.\u201d The Master said, \u201cThey are deter-\nmined to be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. They are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they\nmay make the next class.\u201d\nTsze-kung finally inquired, \u201cOf what sort are those of the present day, who engage in government?\u201d The Master\nsaid \u201cPooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being taken into account.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cSince I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my\ninstructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the\ncautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is wrong.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe people of the south have a saying \u2014\u2018A man without constancy cannot be either a wizard\nor a doctor.\u2019 Good!\n\u201cInconstant in his virtue, he will be visited with disgrace.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThis arises simply from not attending to the prognostication.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not affable.\u201d\nTsze-kung asked, saying, \u201cWhat do you say of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?\u201d The\nMaster replied, \u201cWe may not for that accord our approval of him.\u201d \u201cAnd what do you say of him who is hated by all\nthe people of his neighborhood?\u201d The Master said, \u201cWe may not for that conclude that he is bad. It is better than\neither of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any way\nwhich is not accordant with right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses them according to\ntheir capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy to please. If you try to please him, though it be in a way\nwhich is not accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, he wishes them to be equal to\neverything.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a\ndignified ease.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest are near to virtue.\u201d\nTsze-lu asked, saying, \u201cWhat qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?\u201d The Master\nsaid, \u201cHe must be thus,\u2014earnest, urgent, and bland:\u2014among his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren,\nbland.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cLet a good man teach the people seven years, and they may then likewise be employed in\nwar.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cTo lead an uninstructed people to war, is to throw them away.\u201d\n14\nHsien asked what was shameful. The Master said, \u201cWhen good government prevails in a state, to be thinking\nonly of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary;\u2014this is shame-\nful.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the love of superiority, boasting, resentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be deemed\nperfect virtue.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThis may be regarded as the achievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to be\ndeemed perfect virtue.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen good government prevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions\nthe same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be lofty and bold, but the language may be with some\nreserve.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not always\nbe virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of principle.\u201d\nNan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to Confucius, said, \u201cI was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a boat\nalong upon the land, but neither of them died a natural death. Yu and Chi personally wrought at the toils of hus-\nbandry, and they became possessors of the kingdom.\u201d The Master made no reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went\nout, he said, \u201cA superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is this!\u201d\n432 The Analects\nThe Master said, \u201cSuperior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a\nmean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cCan there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which\ndoes not lead to the instruction of its object?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIn preparing the governmental notifications, P\u2019i Shan first made the rough draft; Shi-shu ex-\namined and discussed its contents; Tsze-yu, the manager of foreign intercourse, then polished the style; and, finally,\nTsze-ch\u2019an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance and finish.\u201d\nSome one asked about Tsze-ch\u2019an. The Master said, \u201cHe was a kind man.\u201d\nHe asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, \u201cThat man! That man!\u201d\nHe asked about Kwan Chung. \u201cFor him,\u201d said the Master, \u201cthe city of Pien, with three hundred families, was\ntaken from the chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmuring word, though, to the end of his life, he had\nonly coarse rice to eat.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cTo be poor without murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cMang Kung-ch\u2019o is more than fit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is\nnot fit to be great officer to either of the states Tang or Hsieh.\u201d\nTsze-lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, \u201cSuppose a man with the knowledge of\nTsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness of Kung-ch\u2019o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied\ntalents of Zan Ch\u2019iu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and music;\u2014such a one might be\nreckoned a COMPLETE man.\u201d\nHe then added, \u201cBut what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The\nman, who in the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and\nwho does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends:\u2014such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE\nman.\u201d\nThe Master asked Kung-ming Chia about Kung-shu Wan, saying, \u201cIs it true that your master speaks not, laughs\nnot, and takes not?\u201d\nKung-ming Chia replied, \u201cThis has arisen from the reporters going beyond the truth.\u2014My master speaks when\nit is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful,\nand so men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men\ndo not get tired of his taking.\u201d The Master said, \u201cSo! But is it so with him?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cTsang Wu-chung, keeping possession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a successor\nto him in his family. Although it may be said that he was not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe duke Wan of Tsin was crafty and not upright. The duke Hwan of Ch\u2019i was upright and not\ncrafty.\u201d\nTsze-lu said, \u201cThe Duke Hwan caused his brother Chiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died, with his master, but\nKwan Chung did not die. May not I say that he was wanting in virtue?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe Duke Hwan assembled all the princes together, and that not with weapons of war and\nchariots:\u2014it was all through the influence of Kwan Chung. Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was\nlike his?\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cKwan Chung, I apprehend was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Hwan caused his brother\nChiu to be killed, Kwan Chung was not able to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Hwan.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cKwan Chung acted as prime minister to the Duke Hwan made him leader of all the princes,\nand united and rectified the whole kingdom. Down to the present day, the people enjoy the gifts which he con-\nferred. But for Kwan Chung, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and the lappets of our coats buttoning\non the left side.\n\u201cWill you require from him the small fidelity of common men and common women, who would commit sui-\ncide in a stream or ditch, no one knowing anything about them?\u201d\nThe great officer, Hsien, who had been family minister to Kung-shu Wan, ascended to the prince\u2019s court in\ncompany with Wan.\nThe Master, having heard of it, said, \u201cHe deserved to be considered WAN (the accomplished).\u201d\nThe Master was speaking about the unprincipled course of the duke Ling of Weil when Ch\u2019i K\u2019ang said, \u201cSince\nhe is of such a character, how is it he does not lose his state?\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cThe Chung-shu Yu has the superintendence of his guests and of strangers; the litanist, T\u2019o, has\nthe management of his ancestral temple; and Wang-sun Chia has the direction of the army and forces:\u2014with such\nofficers as these, how should he lose his state?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHe who speaks without modesty will find it difficult to make his words good.\u201d\nChan Ch\u2019ang murdered the Duke Chien of Ch\u2019i.\nConfucius bathed, went to court and informed the Duke Ai, saying, \u201cChan Hang has slain his sovereign. I beg\n433 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthat you will undertake to punish him.\u201d\nThe duke said, \u201cInform the chiefs of the three families of it.\u201d\nConfucius retired, and said, \u201cFollowing in the rear of the great officers, I did not dare not to represent such a\nmatter, and my prince says, \u201cInform the chiefs of the three families of it.\u201d\nHe went to the chiefs, and informed them, but they would not act. Confucius then said, \u201cFollowing in the rear\nof the great officers, I did not dare not to represent such a matter.\u201d\nTsze-lu asked how a ruler should be served. The Master said, \u201cDo not impose on him, and, moreover, withstand\nhim to his face.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe progress of the superior man is upwards; the progress of the mean man is downwards.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIn ancient times, men learned with a view to their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn\nwith a view to the approbation of others.\u201d\nChu Po-yu sent a messenger with friendly inquiries to Confucius.\nConfucius sat with him, and questioned him. \u201cWhat,\u201d said he! \u201cis your master engaged in?\u201d The messenger re-\nplied, \u201cMy master is anxious to make his faults few, but he has not yet succeeded.\u201d He then went out, and the Master\nsaid, \u201cA messenger indeed! A messenger indeed!\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHe who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of\nits duties.\u201d\nThe philosopher Tsang said, \u201cThe superior man, in his thoughts, does not go out of his place.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man is modest in his speech, but exceeds in his actions.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe way of the superior man is threefold, but I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free from\nanxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear.\nTsze-kung said, \u201cMaster, that is what you yourself say.\u201d\nTsze-kung was in the habit of comparing men together. The Master said, \u201cTsze must have reached a high pitch\nof excellence! Now, I have not leisure for this.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI will not be concerned at men\u2019s not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of\nability.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHe who does not anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his not being\nbelieved, and yet apprehends these things readily when they occur;\u2014is he not a man of superior worth?\u201d\nWei-shang Mau said to Confucius, \u201cCh\u2019iu, how is it that you keep roosting about? Is it not that you are an insin-\nuating talker?\nConfucius said, \u201cI do not dare to play the part of such a talker, but I hate obstinacy.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cA horse is called a ch\u2019i, not because of its strength, but because of its other good qualities.\u201d\nSome one said, \u201cWhat do you say concerning the principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWith what then will you recompense kindness?\u201d\n\u201cRecompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with kindness.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cAlas! there is no one that knows me.\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cWhat do you mean by thus saying\u2014that no one knows you?\u201d The Master replied, \u201cI do not\nmurmur against Heaven. I do not grumble against men. My studies lie low, and my penetration rises high. But there\nis Heaven;\u2014that knows me!\u201d\nThe Kung-po Liao, having slandered Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu Ching-po informed Confucius of it, saying,\n\u201cOur master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut Liao off, and\nexpose his corpse in the market and in the court.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf my principles are to advance, it is so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so or-\ndered. What can the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is concerned?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cSome men of worth retire from the world. Some retire from particular states. Some retire\nbecause of disrespectful looks. Some retire because of contradictory language.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThose who have done this are seven men.\u201d\nTsze-lu happening to pass the night in Shih-man, the gatekeeper said to him, \u201cWhom do you come from?\u201d\nTsze-lu said, \u201cFrom Mr. K\u2019ung.\u201d \u201cIt is he,\u2014is it not?\u201d\u2014said the other, \u201cwho knows the impracticable nature of the\ntimes and yet will be doing in them.\u201d\nThe Master was playing, one day, on a musical stone in Weil when a man carrying a straw basket passed door of\nthe house where Confucius was, and said, \u201cHis heart is full who so beats the musical stone.\u201d\nA little while after, he added, \u201cHow contemptible is the one-ideaed obstinacy those sounds display! When one is\ntaken no notice of, he has simply at once to give over his wish for public employment. \u2018Deep water must be crossed\nwith the clothes on; shallow water may be crossed with the clothes held up.\u2019\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHow determined is he in his purpose! But this is not difficult!\u201d\nTsze-chang said, \u201cWhat is meant when the Shu says that Kao-tsung, while observing the usual imperial mourn-\n434 The Analects\ning, was for three years without speaking?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhy must Kao-tsung be referred to as an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the\nsovereign died, the officers all attended to their several duties, taking instructions from the prime minister for three\nyears.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen rulers love to observe the rules of propriety, the people respond readily to the calls on\nthem for service.\u201d\nTsze-lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, \u201cThe cultivation of himself in reverential\ncarefulness.\u201d \u201cAnd is this all?\u201d said Tsze-lu. \u201cHe cultivates himself so as to give rest to others,\u201d was the reply. \u201cAnd is\nthis all?\u201d again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, \u201cHe cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people. He culti-\nvates himself so as to give rest to all the people:\u2014even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this.\u201d\nYuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and so waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, \u201cIn youth not\nhumble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing worthy of being handed down; and living on to old age:\u2014this\nis to be a pest.\u201d With this he hit him on the shank with his staff.\nA youth of the village of Ch\u2019ueh was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his visi-\ntors. Some one asked about him, saying, \u201cI suppose he has made great progress.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI observe that he is fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks\nshoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes quickly\nto become a man.\u201d\n15\nThe Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about tactics. Confucius replied, \u201cI have heard all about sacrificial ves-\nsels, but I have not learned military matters.\u201d On this, he took his departure the next day.\nWhen he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, and his followers became so in that they were unable to\nrise.\nTsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, \u201cHas the superior man likewise to endure in this way?\u201d The Master\nsaid, \u201cThe superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives way to un-\nbridled license.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cTs\u2019ze, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in memo-\nry?\u201d\nTsze-kung replied, \u201cYes,\u2014but perhaps it is not so?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d was the answer; \u201cI seek a unity all pervading.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cYu I those who know virtue are few.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cMay not Shun be instanced as having governed efficiently without exertion? What did he do?\nHe did nothing but gravely and reverently occupy his royal seat.\u201d\nTsze-chang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated.\nThe Master said, \u201cLet his words be sincere and truthful and his actions honorable and careful;\u2014such conduct\nmay be practiced among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sincere and truthful and his\nactions not honorable and carefull will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his neighborhood?\n\u201cWhen he is standing, let him see those two things, as it were, fronting him. When he is in a carriage, let him\nsee them attached to the yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them into practice.\u201d\nTsze-chang wrote these counsels on the end of his sash.\nThe Master said, \u201cTruly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his\nstate, he was like an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is Chu\nPo-yu! When good government prevails in his state, he is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he\ncan roll his principles up, and keep them in his breast.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When\na man may not be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to\ntheir man nor to their words.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe determined scholar and the man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of injuring\ntheir virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue complete.\u201d\nTsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. The Master said, \u201cThe mechanic, who wishes to do his work well,\nmust first sharpen his tools. When you are living in any state, take service with the most worthy among its great\nofficers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its scholars.\u201d\nYen Yuan asked how the government of a country should be administered.\nThe Master said, \u201cFollow the seasons of Hsia.\n\u201cRide in the state carriage of Yin.\n435 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u201cWear the ceremonial cap of Chau.\n\u201cLet the music be the Shao with its pantomimes. Banish the songs of Chang, and keep far from specious talkers.\nThe songs of Chang are licentious; specious talkers are dangerous.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf a man take no thought about what is distant, he will find sorrow near at hand.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIt is all over! I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWas not Tsang Wan like one who had stolen his situation? He knew the virtue and the talents\nof Hui of Liu-hsia, and yet did not procure that he should stand with him in court.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHe who requires much from himself and little from others, will keep himself from being the\nobject of resentment.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen a man is not in the habit of saying\u2014\u2018What shall I think of this? What shall I think of\nthis?\u2019 I can indeed do nothing with him!\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen a number of people are together, for a whole day, without their conversation turning\non righteousness, and when they are fond of carrying out the suggestions of a small shrewdness;\u2014theirs is indeed a\nhard case.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man in everything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs it\naccording to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in humility. He completes it with sincerity. This is indeed a\nsuperior man.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man is distressed by his want of ability. He is not distressed by men\u2019s not know-\ning him.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man dislikes the thought of his name not being mentioned after his death.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhat the superior man seeks, is in himself. What the mean man seeks, is in others.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man is dignified, but does not wrangle. He is sociable, but not a partisan.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man does not promote a man simply on account of his words, nor does he put\naside good words because of the man.\u201d\nTsze-kung asked, saying, \u201cIs there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one\u2019s life?\u201d The Master\nsaid, \u201cIs not RECIPROCITY such a word? What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIn my dealings with men, whose evil do I blame, whose goodness do I praise, beyond what is\nproper? If I do sometimes exceed in praise, there must be ground for it in my examination of the individual.\n\u201cThis people supplied the ground why the three dynasties pursued the path of straightforwardness.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cEven in my early days, a historiographer would leave a blank in his text, and he who had a\nhorse would lend him to another to ride. Now, alas! there are no such things.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cSpecious words confound virtue. Want of forbearance in small matters confounds great\nplans.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen the multitude hate a man, it is necessary to examine into the case. When the multitude\nlike a man, it is necessary to examine into the case.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cA man can enlarge the principles which he follows; those principles do not enlarge the man.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cTo have faults and not to reform them,\u2014this, indeed, should be pronounced having faults.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI have been the whole day without eating, and the whole night without sleeping:\u2014occupied\nwith thinking. It was of no use. better plan is to learn.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe object of the superior man is truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing;\u2014even in\nthat there is sometimes want. So with learning;\u2014emolument may be found in it. The superior man is anxious lest\nhe should not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon him.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen a man\u2019s knowledge is sufficient to attain, and his virtue is not sufficient to enable him\nto hold, whatever he may have gained, he will lose again.\n\u201cWhen his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has virtue enough to hold fast, if he cannot govern with\ndignity, the people will not respect him.\n\u201cWhen his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has virtue enough to hold fast; when he governs also with\ndignity, yet if he try to move the people contrary to the rules of propriety:\u2014full excellence is not reached.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man cannot be known in little matters; but he may be intrusted with great con-\ncerns. The small man may not be intrusted with great concerns, but he may be known in little matters.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cVirtue is more to man than either water or fire. I have seen men die from treading on water\nand fire, but I have never seen a man die from treading the course of virtue.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cLet every man consider virtue as what devolves on himself. He may not yield the perfor-\nmance of it even to his teacher.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThe superior man is correctly firm, and not firm merely.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cA minister, in serving his prince, reverently discharges his duties, and makes his emolument a\nsecondary consideration.\u201d\n436 The Analects\nThe Master said, \u201cIn teaching there should be no distinction of classes.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThose whose courses are different cannot lay plans for one another.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIn language it is simply required that it convey the meaning.\u201d\nThe music master, Mien, having called upon him, when they came to the steps, the Master said, \u201cHere are the\nsteps.\u201d When they came to the mat for the guest to sit upon, he said, \u201cHere is the mat.\u201d When all were seated, the\nMaster informed him, saying, \u201cSo and so is here; so and so is here.\u201d\nThe music master, Mien, having gone out, Tsze-chang asked, saying. \u201cIs it the rule to tell those things to the\nmusic master?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cYes. This is certainly the rule for those who lead the blind.\u201d\n16\nThe head of the Chi family was going to attack Chwan-yu.\nZan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, \u201cOur chief, Chil is going to commence opera-\ntions against Chwan-yu.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cCh\u2019iu, is it not you who are in fault here?\n\u201cNow, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the\neastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our state; and its ruler is a minister in direct connec-\ntion with the sovereign: What has your chief to do with attacking it?\u201d\nZan Yu said, \u201cOur master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cCh\u2019iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, \u2014\u2018When he can put forth his ability, he takes his place\nin the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retires from it. How can he be used as a guide to a\nblind man, who does not support him when tottering, nor raise him up when fallen?\u2019\n\u201cAnd further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of\njade is injured in its repository:\u2014whose is the fault?\u201d\nZan Yu said, \u201cBut at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter\nbe a sorrow to his descendants.\u201d\nConfucius said. \u201cCh\u2019iu, the superior man hates those declining to say\u2014\u2018I want such and such a thing,\u2019 and fram-\ning explanations for their conduct.\n\u201cI have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are\ntroubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubled with fears of poverty, but are trou-\nbled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep\ntheir several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when\nthere is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings.\n\u201cSo it is.\u2014Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be\ncultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, they must be made contented and tran-\nquil.\n\u201cNow, here are you, Yu and Ch\u2019iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help,\nhe cannot attract them to him. In his own territory there are divisions and downfalls, leavings and separations, and,\nwith your help, he cannot preserve it.\n\u201cAnd yet he is planning these hostile movements within the state.\u2014I am afraid that the sorrow of the Chi-sun\nfamily will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen of their own court.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cWhen good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive military\nexpeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. When bad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music,\nand punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these things proceed from the princes, as a rule,\nthe cases will be few in which they do not lose their power in ten generations. When they proceed from the great\nofficers of the princes, as a rule, the case will be few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When\nthe subsidiary ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule the cases will be few\nin which they do not lose their power in three generations.\n\u201cWhen right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the great officers.\n\u201cWhen right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no discussions among the common people.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cThe revenue of the state has left the ducal house now for five generations. The government has\nbeen in the hands of the great officers for four generations. On this account, the descendants of the three Hwan are\nmuch reduced.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cThere are three friendships which are advantageous, and three which are injurious. Friendship\nwith the uplight; friendship with the sincere; and friendship with the man of much observation:\u2014these are advan-\ntageous. Friendship with the man of specious airs; friendship with the insinuatingly soft; and friendship with the\n437 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nglib-tongued:\u2014these are injurious.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cThere are three things men find enjoyment in which are advantageous, and three things they\nfind enjoyment in which are injurious. To find enjoyment in the discriminating study of ceremonies and music; to\nfind enjoyment in speaking of the goodness of others; to find enjoyment in having many worthy friends:\u2014these\nare advantageous. To find enjoyment in extravagant pleasures; to find enjoyment in idleness and sauntering; to find\nenjoyment in the pleasures of feasting:\u2014these are injurious.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cThere are three errors to which they who stand in the presence of a man of virtue and station\nare liable. They may speak when it does not come to them to speak;\u2014this is called rashness. They may not speak\nwhen it comes to them to speak;\u2014this is called concealment. They may speak without looking at the countenance\nof their superior;\u2014this is called blindness.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cThere are three things which the superior man guards against. In youth, when the physical\npowers are not yet settled, he guards against lust. When he is strong and the physical powers are full of vigor, he\nguards against quarrelsomeness. When he is old, and the animal powers are decayed, he guards against covetous-\nness.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cThere are three things of which the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the ordi-\nnances of Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands in awe of the words of sages.\n\u201cThe mean man does not know the ordinances of Heaven, and consequently does not stand in awe of them. He\nis disrespectful to great men. He makes sport of the words of sages.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cThose who are born with the possession of knowledge are the highest class of men. Those who\nlearn, and so readily get possession of knowledge, are the next. Those who are dull and stupid, and yet compass the\nlearning, are another class next to these. As to those who are dull and stupid and yet do not learn;\u2014they are the\nlowest of the people.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cThe superior man has nine things which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration.\nIn regard to the use of his eyes, he is anxious to see clearly. In regard to the use of his ears, he is anxious to hear dis-\ntinctly. In regard to his countenance, he is anxious that it should be benign. In regard to his demeanor, he is anxious\nthat it should be respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be sincere. In regard to his doing\nof business, he is anxious that it should be reverently careful. In regard to what he doubts about, he is anxious to\nquestion others. When he is angry, he thinks of the difficulties his anger may involve him in. When he sees gain to\nbe got, he thinks of righteousness.\u201d\nConfucius said, \u201cContemplating good, and pursuing it, as if they could not reach it; contemplating evil! and\nshrinking from it, as they would from thrusting the hand into boiling water:\u2014I have seen such men, as I have heard\nsuch words.\n\u201cLiving in retirement to study their aims, and practicing righteousness to carry out their principles:\u2014I have\nheard these words, but I have not seen such men.\u201d\nThe Duke Ching of Ch\u2019i had a thousand teams, each of four horses, but on the day of his death, the people did\nnot praise him for a single virtue. Po-i and Shu-ch\u2019i died of hunger at the foot of the Shau-yang mountains, and the\npeople, down to the present time, praise them.\n\u201cIs not that saying illustrated by this?\u201d\nCh\u2019an K\u2019ang asked Po-yu, saying, \u201cHave you heard any lessons from your father different from what we have all\nheard?\u201d\nPo-yu replied, \u201cNo. He was standing alone once, when I passed below the hall with hasty steps, and said to me,\n\u2018Have you learned the Odes?\u2019 On my replying \u2018Not yet,\u2019 he added, If you do not learn the Odes, you will not be fit to\nconverse with.\u2019 I retired and studied the Odes.\n\u201cAnother day, he was in the same way standing alone, when I passed by below the hall with hasty steps, and said\nto me, \u2018Have you learned the rules of Propriety?\u2019 On my replying \u2018Not yet,\u2019 he added, \u2018If you do not learn the rules of\nPropriety, your character cannot be established.\u2019 I then retired, and learned the rules of Propriety.\n\u201cI have heard only these two things from him.\u201d\nCh\u2019ang K\u2019ang retired, and, quite delighted, said, \u201cI asked one thing, and I have got three things. I have heard\nabout the Odes. I have heard about the rules of Propriety. I have also heard that the superior man maintains a dis-\ntant reserve towards his son.\u201d\nThe wife of the prince of a state is called by him Fu Zan. She calls herself Hsiao T\u2019ung. The people of the state\ncall her Chun Fu Zan, and, to the people of other states, they call her K\u2019wa Hsiao Chun. The people of other states\nalso call her Chun Fu Zan.\n17\nYang Ho wished to see Confucius, but Confucius would not go to see him. On this, he sent a present of a pig to\n438 The Analects\nConfucius, who, having chosen a time when Ho was not at home went to pay his respects for the gift. He met him,\nhowever, on the way.\nHo said to Confucius, \u201cCome, let me speak with you.\u201d He then asked, \u201cCan he be called benevolent who keeps\nhis jewel in his bosom, and leaves his country to confusion?\u201d Confucius replied, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cCan he be called wise,\nwho is anxious to be engaged in public employment, and yet is constantly losing the opportunity of being so?\u201d\nConfucius again said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThe days and months are passing away; the years do not wait for us.\u201d Confucius said,\n\u201cRight; I will go into office.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cBy nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThere are only the wise of the highest class, and the stupid of the lowest class, who cannot be\nchanged.\u201d\nThe Master, having come to Wu-ch\u2019ang, heard there the sound of stringed instruments and singing.\nWell pleased and smiling, he said, \u201cWhy use an ox knife to kill a fowl?\u201d\nTsze-yu replied, \u201cFormerly, Master, I heard you say,\u2014\u2018When the man of high station is well instructed, he loves\nmen; when the man of low station is well instructed, he is easily ruled.\u2019\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cMy disciples, Yen\u2019s words are right. What I said was only in sport.\u201d\nKung-shan Fu-zao, when he was holding Pi, and in an attitude of rebellion, invited the Master to visit him, who\nwas rather inclined to go.\nTsze-lu was displeased. and said, \u201cIndeed, you cannot go! Why must you think of going to see Kung-shan?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cCan it be without some reason that he has invited ME? If any one employ me, may I not make\nan eastern Chau?\u201d\nTsze-chang asked Confucius about perfect virtue. Confucius said, \u201cTo be able to practice five things everywhere\nunder heaven constitutes perfect virtue.\u201d He begged to ask what they were, and was told, \u201cGravity, generosity of\nsoul, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness. If you are grave, you will not be treated with disrespect. If you are gen-\nerous, you will win all. If you are sincere, people will repose trust in you. If you are earnest, you will accomplish\nmuch. If you are kind, this will enable you to employ the services of others.\nPi Hsi inviting him to visit him, the Master was inclined to go.\nTsze-lu said, \u201cMaster, formerly I have heard you say, \u2018When a man in his own person is guilty of doing evil, a\nsuperior man will not associate with him.\u2019 Pi Hsi is in rebellion, holding possession of Chung-mau; if you go to him,\nwhat shall be said?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cYes, I did use these words. But is it not said, that, if a thing be really hard, it may be ground\nwithout being made thin? Is it not said, that, if a thing be really white, it may be steeped in a dark fluid without\nbeing made black?\n\u201cAm I a bitter gourd? How can I be hung up out of the way of being eaten?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cYu, have you heard the six words to which are attached six becloudings?\u201d Yu replied, \u201cI have\nnot.\u201d\n\u201cSit down, and I will tell them to you.\n\u201cThere is the love of being benevolent without the love of learning;\u2014the beclouding here leads to a foolish sim-\nplicity. There is the love of knowing without the love of learning;\u2014the beclouding here leads to dissipation of mind.\nThere is the love of being sincere without the love of learning;\u2014the beclouding here leads to an injurious disregard\nof consequences. There is the love of straightforwardness without the love of learning;\u2014the beclouding here leads\nto rudeness. There is the love of boldness without the love of learning;\u2014the beclouding here leads to insubordina-\ntion. There is the love of firmness without the love of learning;\u2014the beclouding here leads to extravagant conduct.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cMy children, why do you not study the Book of Poetry?\n\u201cThe Odes serve to stimulate the mind.\n\u201cThey may be used for purposes of self-contemplation.\n\u201cThey teach the art of sociability.\n\u201cThey show how to regulate feelings of resentment.\n\u201cFrom them you learn the more immediate duty of serving one\u2019s father, and the remoter one of serving one\u2019s\nprince.\n\u201cFrom them we become largely acquainted with the names of birds, beasts, and plants.\u201d\nThe Master said to Po-yu, \u201cDo you give yourself to the Chau-nan and the Shao-nan. The man who has not\nstudied the Chau-nan and the Shao-nan is like one who stands with his face right against a wall. Is he not so?\u201d The\nMaster said, \u201c\u2018It is according to the rules of propriety,\u2019 they say.\u2014\u2018It is according to the rules of propriety,\u2019 they say.\nAre gems and silk all that is meant by propriety? \u2018It is music,\u2019 they say.\u2014\u2018It is music,\u2019 they say. Are hers and drums all\nthat is meant by music?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHe who puts on an appearance of stern firmness, while inwardly he is weak, is like one of the\nsmall, mean people;\u2014yea, is he not like the thief who breaks through, or climbs over, a wall?\u201d\n439 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThe Master said, \u201cYour good, careful people of the villages are the thieves of virtue.\u201d\nThe Master said, To tell, as we go along, what we have heard on the way, is to cast away our virtue.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cThere are those mean creatures! How impossible it is along with them to serve one\u2019s prince!\n\u201cWhile they have not got their aims, their anxiety is how to get them. When they have got them, their anxiety is\nlest they should lose them.\n\u201cWhen they are anxious lest such things should be lost, there is nothing to which they will not proceed.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cAnciently, men had three failings, which now perhaps are not to be found.\n\u201cThe high-mindedness of antiquity showed itself in a disregard of small things; the high-mindedness of the\npresent day shows itself in wild license. The stern dignity of antiquity showed itself in grave reserve; the stern dig-\nnity of the present day shows itself in quarrelsome perverseness. The stupidity of antiquity showed itself in straight-\nforwardness; the stupidity of the present day shows itself in sheer deceit.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cFine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with virtue.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI hate the manner in which purple takes away the luster of vermilion. I hate the way in which\nthe songs of Chang confound the music of the Ya. I hate those who with their sharp mouths overthrow kingdoms\nand families.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cI would prefer not speaking.\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cIf you, Master, do not speak, what shall we, your disciples, have to record?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cDoes Heaven speak? The four seasons pursue their courses, and all things are continually\nbeing produced, but does Heaven say anything?\u201d\nZu Pei wished to see Confucius, but Confucius declined, on the ground of being sick, to see him. When the\nbearer of this message went out at the door, the Master took his lute and sang to it, in order that Pei might hear him.\nTsai Wo asked about the three years\u2019 mourning for parents, saying that one year was long enough.\n\u201cIf the superior man,\u201d said he, \u201cabstains for three years from the observances of propriety, those observances\nwill be quite lost. If for three years he abstains from music, music will be ruined. Within a year the old grain is ex-\nhausted, and the new grain has sprung up, and, in procuring fire by friction, we go through all the changes of wood\nfor that purpose. After a complete year, the mourning may stop.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cIf you were, after a year, to eat good rice, and wear embroidered clothes, would you feel at\nease?\u201d \u201cI should,\u201d replied Wo.\nThe Master said, \u201cIf you can feel at ease, do it. But a superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does\nnot enjoy pleasant food which he may eat, nor derive pleasure from music which he may hear. He also does not feel\nat ease, if he is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does not do what you propose. But now you feel at ease and may\ndo it.\u201d\nTsai Wo then went out, and the Master said, \u201cThis shows Yu\u2019s want of virtue. It is not till a child is three\nyears old that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three years\u2019 mourning is universally observed\nthroughout the empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years\u2019 love of his parents?\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cHard is it to deal with who will stuff himself with food the whole day, without applying his\nmind to anything good! Are there not gamesters and chess players? To be one of these would still be better than\ndoing nothing at all.\u201d\nTsze-lu said, \u201cDoes the superior man esteem valor?\u201d The Master said, \u201cThe superior man holds righteousness to\nbe of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be guilty of insub-\nordination; one of the lower people having valor without righteousness, will commit robbery.\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cHas the superior man his hatreds also?\u201d The Master said, \u201cHe has his hatreds. He hates those\nwho proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those\nwho have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and determined, and, at\nthe same time, of contracted understanding.\u201d\nThe Master then inquired, \u201cTs\u2019ze, have you also your hatreds?\u201d Tsze-kung replied, \u201cI hate those who pry out\nmatters, and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who are only not modest, and think that they are\nvalorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they are straightforward.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cOf all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with\nthem, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve towards them, they are discontented.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWhen a man at forty is the object of dislike, he will always continue what he is.\u201d\n18\nThe Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pi-kan remonstrat-\ned with him and died.\nConfucius said, \u201cThe Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue.\u201d\nHui of Liu-hsia, being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Some one said to him, \u201cIs it\nnot yet time for you, sir, to leave this?\u201d He replied, \u201cServing men in an upright way, where shall I go to, and not ex-\n440 The Analects\nperience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? If I choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me\nto leave the country of my parents?\u201d\nThe duke Ching of Ch\u2019i, with reference to the manner in which he should treat Confucius, said, \u201cI cannot treat\nhim as I would the chief of the Chi family. I will treat him in a manner between that accorded to the chief of the\nChil and that given to the chief of the Mang family.\u201d He also said, \u201cI am old; I cannot use his doctrines.\u201d Confucius\ntook his departure.\nThe people of Ch\u2019i sent to Lu a present of female musicians, which Chi Hwan received, and for three days no\ncourt was held. Confucius took his departure.\nThe madman of Ch\u2019u, Chieh-yu, passed by Confucius, singing and saying, \u201cO FANG! O FANG! How is your\nvirtue degenerated! As to the past, reproof is useless; but the future may still be provided against. Give up your vain\npursuit. Give up your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who now engage in affairs of government.\u201d\nConfucius alighted and wished to converse with him, but Chieh-yu hastened away, so that he could not talk\nwith him.\nCh\u2019ang-tsu and Chieh-ni were at work in the field together, when Confucius passed by them, and sent Tsze-lu to\ninquire for the ford.\nCh\u2019ang-tsu said, \u201cWho is he that holds the reins in the carriage there?\u201d Tsze-lu told him, \u201cIt is K\u2019ung Ch\u2019iu.\u2019, \u201cIs it\nnot K\u2019ung of Lu?\u201d asked he. \u201cYes,\u201d was the reply, to which the other rejoined, \u201cHe knows the ford.\u201d\nTsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, \u201cWho are you, sir?\u201d He answered, \u201cI am Chung Yu.\u201d \u201cAre\nyou not the disciple of K\u2019ung Ch\u2019iu of Lu?\u201d asked the other. \u201cI am,\u201d replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to him, \u201cDis-\norder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its state for you? Rather\nthan follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow those who have with-\ndrawn from the world altogether?\u201d With this he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with his work, without\nstopping.\nTsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when the Master observed with a sigh, \u201cIt is impossible to associate\nwith birds and beasts, as if they were the same with us. If I associate not with these people,\u2014with mankind,\u2014with\nwhom shall I associate? If right principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its\nstate.\u201d\nTsze-lu, following the Master, happened to fall behind, when he met an old man, carrying across his shoulder\non a staff a basket for weeds. Tsze-lu said to him, \u201cHave you seen my master, sir?\u201d The old man replied, \u201cYour four\nlimbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five kinds of grain:\u2014who is your master?\u201d With this, he\nplanted his staff in the ground, and proceeded to weed.\nTsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood before him.\nThe old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his house, killed a fowl, prepared millet, and feasted him. He also\nintroduced to him his two sons.\nNext day, Tsze-lu went on his way, and reported his adventure. The Master said, \u201cHe is a recluse,\u201d and sent Tsze-\nlu back to see him again, but when he got to the place, the old man was gone.\nTsze-lu then said to the family, \u201cNot to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and young may\nnot be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between sovereign and minister?\nWishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great relation to come to confusion. A superior man takes\noffice, and performs the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is\naware of that.\u201d\nThe men who have retired to privacy from the world have been Po-i, Shu-ch\u2019i, Yuchung, I-yi, Chu-chang, Hui of\nLiu-hsia, and Shao-lien.\nThe Master said, \u201cRefusing to surrender their wills, or to submit to any taint in their persons; such, I think, were\nPo-i and Shu-ch\u2019i.\n\u201cIt may be said of Hui of Liu-hsia! and of Shaolien, that they surrendered their wills, and submitted to taint in\ntheir persons, but their words corresponded with reason, and their actions were such as men are anxious to see.\nThis is all that is to be remarked in them.\n\u201cIt may be said of Yu-chung and I-yi, that, while they hid themselves in their seclusion, they gave a license to\ntheir words; but in their persons, they succeeded in preserving their purity, and, in their retirement, they acted\naccording to the exigency of the times.\n\u201cI am different from all these. I have no course for which I am predetermined, and no course against which I\nam predetermined.\u201d\nThe grand music master, Chih, went to Ch\u2019i.\nKan, the master of the band at the second meal, went to Ch\u2019u. Liao, the band master at the third meal, went to\nTs\u2019ai. Chueh, the band master at the fourth meal, went to Ch\u2019in.\nFang-shu, the drum master, withdrew to the north of the river.\n441 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nWu, the master of the hand drum, withdrew to the Han.\nYang, the assistant music master, and Hsiang, master of the musical stone, withdrew to an island in the sea.\nThe duke of Chau addressed his son, the duke of Lu, saying, \u201cThe virtuous prince does not neglect his relations.\nHe does not cause the great ministers to repine at his not employing them. Without some great cause, he does not\ndismiss from their offices the members of old families. He does not seek in one man talents for every employment.\u201d\nTo Chau belonged the eight officers, Po-ta, Po-kwo, Chung-tu, Chung-hwu, Shu-ya, Shuhsia, Chi-sui, and Chi-kwa.\n19\nTsze-chang said, \u201cThe scholar, trained for public duty, seeing threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice his life.\nWhen the opportunity of gain is presented to him, he thinks of righteousness. In sacrificing, his thoughts are rever-\nential. In mourning, his thoughts are about the grief which he should feel. Such a man commands our approbation\nindeed.\nTsze-chang said, \u201cWhen a man holds fast to virtue, but without seeking to enlarge it, and believes in right prin-\nciples, but without firm sincerity, what account can be made of his existence or non-existence?\u201d\nThe disciples of Tsze-hsia asked Tsze-chang about the principles that should characterize mutual intercourse.\nTsze-chang asked, \u201cWhat does Tsze-hsia say on the subject?\u201d They replied, \u201cTsze-hsia says: \u2018Associate with those\nwho can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do so.\u2019\u201d Tsze-chang observed, \u201cThis is different from\nwhat I have learned. The superior man honors the talented and virtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good,\nand pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great talents and virtue?\u2014who is there among men whom I will not\nbear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue?\u2014men will put me away from them. What have we to do with the\nputting away of others?\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cEven in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but if it be\nattempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable. Therefore, the supe-\nrior man does not practice them.\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cHe, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not\nforget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn.\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cThere are learning extensively, and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness,\nand reflecting with self-application:\u2014virtue is in such a course.\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cMechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The superior man\nlearns, in order to reach to the utmost of his principles.\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cThe mean man is sure to gloss his faults.\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cThe superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern; when\napproached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided.\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cThe superior man, having obtained their confidence, may then impose labors on his people. If\nhe have not gained their confidence, they will think that he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence of\nhis prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not gained his confidence, the prince will think that he is\nvilifying him.\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cWhen a person does not transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass and\nrepass it in the small virtues.\u201d\nTsze-yu said, \u201cThe disciples and followers of Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering\nand replying, in advancing and receding, are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the branches of learning,\nand they are left ignorant of what is essential.\u2014How can they be acknowledged as sufficiently taught?\u201d\nTsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, \u201cAlas! Yen Yu is wrong. According to the way of the superior man in\nteaching, what departments are there which he considers of prime importance, and delivers? what are there which\nhe considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are\nassorted according to their classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to\nmake fools of any of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of\nlearning?\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cThe officer, having discharged all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student,\nhaving completed his learning, should apply himself to be an officer.\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cMourning, having been carried to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.\u201d\nTsze-hsia said, \u201cMy friend Chang can do things which are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.\u201d\nThe philosopher Tsang said, \u201cHow imposing is the manner of Chang! It is difficult along with him to practice\nvirtue.\u201d\nThe philosopher Tsang said, \u201cI heard this from our Master: \u2018Men may not have shown what is in them to the\nfull extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on the occasion of mourning for their parents.\u201d\n442 The Analects\nThe philosopher Tsang said, \u201cI have heard this from our Master:\u2014\u2018The filial piety of Mang Chwang, in other\nmatters, was what other men are competent to, but, as seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his\nfather\u2019s mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to.\u2019\u201d\nThe chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter consulted the phi-\nlosopher Tsang. Tsang said, \u201cThe rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have been disorga-\nnized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do\nnot feel joy at your own ability.\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cChau\u2019s wickedness was not so great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates to\ndwell in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will flow in upon him.\u201d\nTsze-kung said, \u201cThe faults of the superior man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his faults, and\nall men see them; he changes again, and all men look up to him.\u201d\nKung-sun Ch\u2019ao of Wei asked Tszekung, saying. \u201cFrom whom did Chung-ni get his learning?\u201d\nTsze-kung replied, \u201cThe doctrines of Wan and Wu have not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found\namong men. Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing such\ntalents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan and Wu. Where could our Mas-\nter go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there for his having a\nregular master?\u201d\nShu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great officers in the court, saying, \u201cTsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.\u201d\nTsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, \u201cLet me use the comparison of a house and\nits encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever is valuable in\nthe apartments.\n\u201cThe wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the\nancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array.\n\u201cBut I may assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might\nhave been expected?\u201d\nShu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of Chung-ni, Tsze-kung said, \u201cIt is of no use doing so. Chung-ni can-\nnot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni\nis the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage,\nwhat harm can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own capacity.\nCh\u2019an Tsze-ch\u2019 in, addressing Tsze-kung, said, \u201cYou are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be superior to\nyou?\u201d\nTsze-kung said to him, \u201cFor one word a man is often deemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to\nbe foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say.\n\u201cOur Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a stair.\n\u201cWere our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the chief of a family, we should find verified the\ndescription which has been given of a sage\u2019s rule:\u2014he would plant the people, and forthwith they would be estab-\nlished; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make them happy, and forthwith\nmultitudes would resort to his dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would be harmonious.\nWhile he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly lamented. How is it possible for him to be\nattained to?\u201d\n20\nYao said, \u201cOh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely hold\nfast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a\nperpetual end.\u201d\nShun also used the same language in giving charge to Yu.\nT\u2019ang said, \u201cI the child Li, presume to use a dark-colored victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most\ngreat and sovereign God, that the sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity.\nThe examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offenses, they are not to be attributed to you,\nthe people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses, these offenses must rest on my person.\u201d\nChau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched.\n\u201cAlthough he has his near relatives, they are not equal to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame\nupon me, the One man.\u201d\nHe carefully attended to the weights and measures, examined the body of the laws, restored the discarded offi-\ncers, and the good government of the kingdom took its course.\nHe revived states that had been extinguished, restored families whose line of succession had been broken,\n443 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nand called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people\nturned towards him.\nWhat he attached chief importance to were the food of the people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices.\nBy his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made the people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his\nachievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted.\nTsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, \u201cIn what way should a person in authority act in order that he may\nconduct government properly?\u201d The Master replied, \u201cLet him honor the five excellent, and banish away the four\nbad, things;\u2014then may he conduct government properly.\u201d Tsze-chang said, \u201cWhat are meant by the five excellent\nthings?\u201d The Master said, \u201cWhen the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks\non the people without their repining; when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains\na dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.\u201d\nTsze-chang said, \u201cWhat is meant by being beneficent without great expenditure?\u201d The Master replied, \u201cWhen\nthe person in authority makes more beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;\u2014\nis not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes\nthem labor on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who\nwill accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he\ndoes not dare to indicate any disrespect;\u2014is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his\nclothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;\u2014is not this to\nbe majestic without being fierce?\u201d\nTsze-chang then asked, \u201cWhat are meant by the four bad things?\u201d The Master said, \u201cTo put the people to death\nwithout having instructed them;\u2014this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, with-\nout having given them warning;\u2014this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when\nthe time comes, to insist on them with severity;\u2014this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay or rewards to\nmen, to do it in a stingy way;\u2014this is called acting the part of a mere official.\u201d\nThe Master said, \u201cWithout recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man.\n\u201cWithout an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be established.\n\u201cWithout knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.\u201d\nTHE ArT oF wAr\nLicense: Open Access\nSun Tzu, Translated by Lionel Giles\nProbably 6th century B.C.E.\nChina\nSun Tzu\u2019s Art of War is still studied in military academies around the world, including the US military acade-\nmies (USMA, USNA, and USAFA), and it is taught in business schools and law schools as a manual on how to get\nahead of the competition. While scholars argue about when Sun Tzu lived (or whether he was using an older text,\nor even whether someone named Sun Tzu existed), the impact that the work has had is undeniable. The work is\nboth a military treatise and a philosophical argument about the nature of humanity. Unlike previous strategists,\n\u201cSun-Tzu had no patience with the protracted games generals seemed to enjoy playing with each other. Once hos-\ntilities had erupted, one\u2019s priority was to defeat the enemy, not indulge oneself in chivalry which could only prolong\nthe conflict and cost more lives.\u201d (Mark)\nIn Confucian thinking, everyone has an assigned place in society, with strict expectations for behavior that\ncould potentially limit creative\/unusual responses. Sun Tzu\u2019s approach to warfare is Daoist in nature, rather than\nConfucian \u201cby adapting oneself to one\u2019s situation, rather than rigidly holding fast to how one thinks things should\nbe, one is able to recognize the fluidity of conditions and act upon them decisively.\u201d (Mark)\nIt is therefore Sun Tzu\u2019s skill as a Daoist philosopher that guides the work and provides the reader with an in-\nsightful view of human nature.\nWritten by Laura J. Getty\nSun Tzu on the Art of war\nIntroduction\nSsu-ma Ch\u2019ien gives the following biography of Sun Tzu:\nSun Tzu Wu was a native of the Ch\u2019i State. His ART OF WAR brought him to the notice of Ho Lu, King of Wu.\n444 The Art of War\nHo Lu said to him: \u201cI have carefully perused your 13 chapters. May I submit your theory of managing soldiers to a\nslight test?\u201d\nSun Tzu replied: \u201cYou may.\u201d\nHo Lu asked: \u201cMay the test be applied to women?\u201d\nThe answer was again in the affirmative, so arrangements were made to bring 180 ladies out of the Palace. Sun\nTzu divided them into two companies, and placed one of the King\u2019s favorite concubines at the head of each. He then\nbade them all take spears in their hands, and addressed them thus: \u201cI presume you know the difference between\nfront and back, right hand and left hand?\u201d\nThe girls replied: \u201cYes.\u201d\nSun Tzu went on: \u201cWhen I say \u2018Eyes front,\u2019 you must look straight ahead. When I say \u2018Left turn,\u2019 you must face\ntowards your left hand. When I say \u2018Right turn,\u2019 you must face towards your right hand. When I say \u2018About turn,\u2019\nyou must face right round towards your back.\u201d\nAgain the girls assented. The words of command having been thus explained, he set up the halberds and bat-\ntle-axes in order to begin the drill. Then, to the sound of drums, he gave the order \u201cRight turn.\u201d But the girls only\nburst out laughing. Sun Tzu said: \u201cIf words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly\nunderstood, then the general is to blame.\u201d\nSo he started drilling them again, and this time gave the order \u201cLeft turn,\u201d whereupon the girls once more burst\ninto fits of laughter. Sun Tzu: \u201cIf words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly under-\nstood, the general is to blame. But if his orders ARE clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault\nof their officers.\u201d\nSo saying, he ordered the leaders of the\ntwo companies to be beheaded. Now the\nking of Wu was watching the scene from\nthe top of a raised pavilion; and when he\nsaw that his favorite concubines were about\nto be executed, he was greatly alarmed and\nhurriedly sent down the following mes-\nsage: \u201cWe are now quite satisfied as to our\ngeneral\u2019s ability to handle troops. If We are\nbereft of these two concubines, our meat\nand drink will lose their savor. It is our wish\nthat they shall not be beheaded.\u201d\nSun Tzu replied: \u201cHaving once received\nHis Majesty\u2019s commission to be the general\nof his forces, there are certain commands of\nHis Majesty which, acting in that capacity, I\nam unable to accept.\u201d\nAccordingly, he had the two leaders\nbeheaded, and straightway installed the pair\nnext in order as leaders in their place. When\nthis had been done, the drum was sounded\nfor the drill once more; and the girls went\nthrough all the evolutions, turning to the\nright or to the left, marching ahead or wheel-\ning back, kneeling or standing, with perfect\naccuracy and precision, not venturing to\nutter a sound. Then Sun Tzu sent a messen-\nger to the King saying: \u201cYour soldiers, Sire,\nare now properly drilled and disciplined, and\nready for your majesty\u2019s inspection. They can\nImage 2.2: Bamboo Book-Binding | A copy of The Art of War in Chinese be put to any use that their sovereign may\nbamboo binding. desire; bid them go through fire and water,\nand they will not disobey.\u201d\nAuthor: User \u201cvlasta2\u201d\nBut the King replied: \u201cLet our general\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\ncease drilling and return to camp. As for us,\nLicense: CC BY 2.0\nWe have no wish to come down and inspect\nthe troops.\u201d\n445 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThereupon Sun Tzu said: \u201cThe King is only fond of words, and cannot translate them into deeds.\u201d\nAfter that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzu was one who knew how to handle an army, and finally appointed him\ngeneral. In the west, he defeated the Ch\u2019u State and forced his way into Ying, the capital; to the north he put fear\ninto the States of Ch\u2019i and Chin, and spread his fame abroad amongst the feudal princes. And Sun Tzu shared in the\nmight of the King.\nI. Laying Plans\n1. Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.\n2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on\nno account be neglected.\n3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one\u2019s deliberations, when\nseeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.\n4. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and Discipline.\n5, 6. The MORAL LAW causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him\nregardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.\n7. HEAVEN signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.\n8. EARTH comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances\nof life and death.\n9. The COMMANDER stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage, and strictness.\n10. By METHOD AND DISCIPLINE are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions,\nthe graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army,\nand the control of military expenditure.\n11. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them\nnot will fail.\n12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis\nof a comparison, in this wise:\u2014\n13. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? (2) Which of the two generals has most ability?\n(3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigor-\nously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In\nwhich army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?\n14. By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.\n15. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer:\u2014let such a one be retained in com-\nmand! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:\u2014let such a one be\ndismissed!\n16. While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the\nordinary rules.\n17. According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one\u2019s plans.\n18. All warfare is based on deception.\n19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are\nnear, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.\n20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.\n21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.\n22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.\n23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.\n24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.\n25. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.\n446 The Art of War\n26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general\nwho loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few\ncalculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who\nis likely to win or lose.\nII. Waging War\n1. Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy\nchariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers with provisions enough to carry them a thousand LI the\nexpenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and\nsums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of\nraising an army of 100,000 men.\n2. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men\u2019s weapons will grow dull and their\nardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.\n3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.\n4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other\nchieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert\nthe consequences that must ensue.\n5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.\n6. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.\n7. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable\nway of carrying it on.\n8. The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.\n9. Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its\nneeds.\n10. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing\nto maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.\n11. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people\u2019s substance\nto be drained away.\n12. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.\n13, 14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and\nthree-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out hors-\nes, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy\nwagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.\n15. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy\u2019s provisions is equiv-\nalent to twenty of one\u2019s own, and likewise a single PICUL of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one\u2019s\nown store.\n16. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating\nthe enemy, they must have their rewards.\n17. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took\nthe first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in con-\njunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.\n18. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one\u2019s own strength.\n19. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.\n20. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people\u2019s fate, the man on whom it depends\nwhether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.\n447 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nIII. Attack by Stratagem\nSun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy\u2019s country whole and intact; to\nshatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a\nregiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.\n2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking\nthe enemy\u2019s resistance without fighting.\n3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy\u2019s plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the\nenemy\u2019s forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy\u2019s army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to be-\nsiege walled cities.\n4. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shel-\nters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against\nthe walls will take three months more.\n5. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result\nthat one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a\nsiege.\n6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy\u2019s troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without\nlaying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.\n7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will\nbe complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.\n8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy\u2019s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice\nas numerous, to divide our army into two.\n9. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in\nevery way, we can flee from him.\n10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger\nforce.\n11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points, the State will be strong; if the\nbulwark is defective, the State will be weak.\n12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:\u2014\n13. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is\ncalled hobbling the army.\n14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the condi-\ntions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier\u2019s minds.\n15. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of\nadaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.\n16. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is sim-\nply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.\n17. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when\nnot to fight. (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. (3) He will win whose\narmy is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to\ntake the enemy unprepared. (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sover-\neign.\n18. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If\nyou know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither\nthe enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\nIV. Tactical Dispositions\n1. Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an\nopportunity of defeating the enemy.\n448 The Art of War\n2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided\nby the enemy himself.\n3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.\n4. Hence the saying: One may KNOW how to conquer without being able to DO it.\n5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.\n6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.\n7. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack\nflashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on\nthe other, a victory that is complete.\n8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.\n9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \u201cWell done!\u201d\n10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the\nnoise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.\n11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.\n12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.\n13. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it\nmeans conquering an enemy that is already defeated.\n14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the\nmoment for defeating the enemy.\n15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is\ndestined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.\n16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his\npower to control success.\n17. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calcula-\ntion; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.\n18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of\nquantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.\n19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound\u2019s weight placed in the scale against a single grain.\n20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.\nVI. Weak Points and Strong\n1. Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever\nis second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.\n2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy\u2019s will to be imposed\non him.\n3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting dam-\nage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.\n4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly\nencamped, he can force him to move.\n5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not\nexpected.\n6. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is\nnot.\n7. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended. You can\nensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.\n8. hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skill-\n449 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.\n9. o divine art of subtlety and secrecy! through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and\nhence we can hold the enemy\u2019s fate in our hands.\n10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy\u2019s weak points; you may\nretire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.\n11. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind\na high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to\nrelieve.\n12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our\nencampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unac-\ncountable in his way.\n13. By discovering the enemy\u2019s dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces\nconcentrated, while the enemy\u2019s must be divided.\n14. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. hence there will be a\nwhole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy\u2019s few.\n15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire\nstraits.\n16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare\nagainst a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many\ndirections, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\n17. for should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he\nwill weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his\nright, he will weaken his left. if he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.\n18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from\ncompelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.\n19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances\nin order to fight.\n20. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the\nright equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the\nvan. how much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred Li apart,\nand even the nearest are separated by several Li!\n21. though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advan-\ntage them nothing in the matter of victory. i say then that victory can be achieved.\n22. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to dis-\ncover his plans and the likelihood of their success.\n23. rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. force him to reveal himself, so as to\nfind out his vulnerable spots.\n24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is super-\nabundant and where it is deficient.\n25. in making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your\ndispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the\nwisest brains.\n26. how victory may be produced for them out of the enemy\u2019s own tactics\u2014that is what the multitude\ncannot comprehend.\n27. All men can see the tactics whereby i conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which\nvictory is evolved.\n28. do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the\ninfinite variety of circumstances.\n450 The Art of War\n29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and\nhastens downwards.\n30. so in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.\n31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works\nout his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.\n32. therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.\n33. he who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be\ncalled a heaven-born captain.\n34. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four\nseasons make way for each other in turn. there are short days and long; the moon has its periods of\nwaning and waxing.\nTHE BooK oF SonGS\nExisted before Confucius (born around 551 B.C.E.)\nChina\nThe Book of Songs (the Shi king, also translated as The Classic of Poetry and The Book of Odes) is a collection of\npoems written by various anonymous authors over several centuries. Traditionally, Confucius has been credited as\nthe editor of the collection, and it was part of the canon of Confucian works that scholars were expected to study.\nScholars debate how much influence Confucius may have had on them; one theory is that he took a much larger\nwork (possibly several thousand poems) and chose just over three hundred to form the standard version that exists\ntoday. Poetry collections in China were meant to represent the voice of the people (male and female, all social class-\nes). The poems capture moments in time, speaking to the reader about the problems and joys of individuals who\nwere not necessarily the rulers or heroes of other stories.\nWritten by Laura J.

Mencius\u2019s lifetime on (ca. 371-289 B.C.E.)\nChina\nMencius (ca. 371\u2013289 B.C.E) is an early Chinese philosopher who contributed to the development of Confu-\ncianism, and he is regarded as the \u201csecond sage\u201d in this tradition. He wrote the Mencius, a Confucian text, which\nwas published as one of the \u201cFour Books\u201d of Confucianism in 1190 C.E. by Zhu Xi, a Neo-Confucian philosopher.\nThe Mencius contains Mencius\u2019s sayings, the writings about his life, and his philosophical statements about human\nnature and government. Mencius emphasized the rulers\u2019 obligations to look after the welfare of the common people.\nMencius believed that humans are basically good with the \u201cseeds\u201d of virtue. The selected text here is a famous leg-\nend about Mencius\u2019s mother from James Legge\u2019s 1895 translation. It sheds light on the educational devotion of Men-\ncius\u2019s mother (e.g., her moving three times for his education), her Confucian beliefs, and her influence on Mencius.\nWritten by Kyounghye Kwon\nThe Mother of Mencius\nLicense: Public Domain\nTranslated by William Jennings\nChapter II: Mencius and His opinions\nSection I: Life of Mencius\n1. The materials for a Memoir of Mencius are very scanty.\nThe birth and principal incidents of Confucius\u2019 life are\nduly chronicled in the various annotated editions of the\nCh\u2018un Ts\u2018ew, and in Sze-ma Ts\u2018\u00eben. Paucity and uncertain-\nty of materials.\nIt is not so in the case of Mencius. Ts\u2018\u00eben\u2019s account of him\nis contained in half a dozen columns which are without\na single date. That in the \u201cCyclop\u00e6dia of Surnames\u201d only\ncovers half a page. Chaou K\u2018e is more particular in regard\nto the early years of his subject, but he is equally indefi-\nnite. Our chief informants are K\u2018ung Foo, and L\u00ebw Heang\nin his \u201cRecord of Note-worthy Women,\u201d but what we find\nin them has more the character of legend than history.\nIt is not till we come to the pages of Mencius himself that\nwe are treading on any certain ground. They give the\nprincipal incidents of his public life, extending over about\ntwenty-four years. We learn from them that in the course\nof that time he was in such and such places, and gave\nexpression to such and such opinions; but where he went\nImage 2.3: Mencius | Chinese philosopher and interpreter of first and where he went last, it is next to impossible to de-\nConfucianism.\ntermine. I have carefully examined three attempts, made\nby competent scholars of the present dynasty, to construct\nAuthor: User \u201cPhidiasNL\u201d\na Harmony that shall reconcile the statements of the \u201cSev-\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain en Books\u201d with the current chronologies of the time, and\ndo not see my way to adopt entirely the conclusions of\nany one of them. The value of the Books lies in the record which they furnish of Mencius\u2019 sentiments, and the\nlessons which these supply for the regulation of individual conduct and national policy. It is of little importance\nthat we should be able to lay them down in the strict order of time.\nWith Mencius\u2019 withdrawal from public life, all traces of him disappear. All that is said of him is that he\nspent his latter years along with his disciples in the preparation and publication of his Works.\nFrom this paragraph it will be seen that there is not much to be said in this section. I shall relate, first, what\nis reported of the early years and training of our philosopher, and then look at him as he comes before us in his\nown pages, in the full maturity of his character and powers.\n463 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n2. Mencius is the latinized form of M\u0103ng-tsze, \u201cThe philosopher M\u0103ng.\u201d His surname, birth-place; parents; the\nyear of his birth, bc 371.\nHis surname thus connects him with the M\u0103ng or M\u0103ng-sun family, one of the three great Houses of Loo,\nwhose usurpations were such an offence to Confucius in his day. Their power was broken in the time of duke\nGae (bc 493\u2014467), and they thenceforth dwindle into comparative insignificance. Some branches remained in\nobscurity in Loo, and others went forth to the neighbouring States.\nThe branch from which Mencius sprang found a home in the small adjacent principality of Tsow, which\nin former times had been made known by the name of Choo. It was absorbed by Loo, and afterwards by Ts\u2018oo,\nand its name is still retained in one of the districts of the department of Yen-chow in Shan-tung. Confucius was\na native of a district of Loo having the same name, which many contend was also the birth-place of Mencius,\nmaking him a native of Loo and not of the State of Tsow. To my mind the evidence is decidedly against such a\nview.\nMencius\u2019 name was K\u2018o. His designation does not appear in his Works, nor is any given to him by Sze-ma\nTs\u2018\u00eben or Chaou K\u2018e. The latter says that he did not know how he had been styled; but the legends tell that he\nwas called Tsze-keu, and Tsze-yu. The same authorities\u2014if we can call them such\u2014say that his father\u2019s name\nwas Keih, and that he was styled Kung-e. They say also that his mother\u2019s maiden surname was Chang. Nothing\nis related of the former but that he died when his son was quite young, but the latter must have a paragraph\nto herself. \u201cThe mother of Mencius\u201d is famous in China, and held up to the present time as a model of what a\nmother should be.\nThe year of Mencius\u2019 birth was probably the 4th of the emperor L\u00ebeh, bc 371. He lived to the age of 84, dy-\ning in in the year bc 288, the 26th of the emperor Nan, with whom terminated the long sovereignty of the Chow\ndynasty. The first twenty-three years of his life thus synchronized with the last twenty-three of Plato\u2019s. Aristotle,\nZeno, Epicurus, Demosthenes, and other great men of the West, were also his contemporaries. When we place\nMencius among them, he can look them in the face. He does not need to hide a diminished head.\n3. It was his misfortune, according to Chaou K\u2018e, \u201cto lose his father at an early period; but in his youthful years he\nenjoyed the lessons of his kind mother, who thrice changed her residence on his account.\u201d\nMencius\u2019 mother.\nAt first they lived near a cemetery, and Mencius amused himself with acting the various scenes which he\nwitnessed at the tombs. \u201cThis,\u201d said the lady, \u201cis no place for my son;\u201d\u2014and she removed to a house in the\nmarket-place. But the change was no improvement. The boy took to playing the part of a salesman, vaunting his\nwares, and chaffering with customers. His mother sought a new house, and found one at last close by a public\nschool. There her child\u2019s attention was taken with the various exercises of politeness which the scholars were\ntaught, and he endeavoured to imitate them. The mother was satisfied. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, \u201cis the proper place for\nmy son.\u201d\nHan Ying relates another story of this period. Near their house was a pig-butcher\u2019s. One day Mencius asked\nhis mother what they were killing the pigs for, and was told that it was to feed him. Her conscience immediately\nreproved her for the answer. She said to herself, \u201cWhile I was carrying this boy in my womb, I would not sit\ndown if the mat was not placed square, and I ate no meat which was not cut properly;\u2014so I taught him when\nhe was yet unborn. And now when his intelligence is opening, I am deceiving him;\u2014this is to teach him un-\ntruthfulness!\u201d With this she went and bought a piece of pork in order to make good her words.\nAs Mencius grew up, he was sent to school. When he returned home one day, his mother looked up from\nthe web which she was weaving, and asked him how far he had got on. He answered her with an air of indif-\nference that he was doing well enough, on which she took a knife and cut the thread of her shuttle. The idler\nwas alarmed, and asked what she meant, when she gave him a long lecture, showing that she had done what he\nwas doing,\u2014that her cutting her thread was like his neglecting his learning. The admonition, it is said, had its\nproper effect; the lecture did not need to be repeated.\nThere are two other narratives in which Chang-she figures, and though they belong to a later part of Men-\ncius\u2019 life, it may be as well to embrace them in the present paragraph.\nHis wife was squatting down one day in her own room, when Mencius went in. He was so much offended\nat finding her in that position, that he told his mother, and expressed his intention to put her away, because of\n\u201cher want of propriety.\u201d \u201cIt is you who have no propriety,\u201d said his mother, \u201cand not your wife. Do not \u2018the Rules\nof Propriety\u2019 say, \u2018When you are about to ascend a hall, raise your voice; when you enter a door, keep your eyes\nlow?\u2019 The reason of the rules is that people may not be taken unprepared; but you entered the door of your pri-\nvate apartment without raising your voice, and so caused your wife to be caught squatting on the ground. The\nimpropriety is with you and not with her.\u201d On this Mencius fell to reproving himself, and did not dare to put\naway his wife.\nOne day, when he was living with his mother in Ts\u2018e, she was struck with the sorrowfulness of his aspect,\n464 The Mother of Mencius\nas he stood leaning against a pillar, and asked him the cause of it. He replied, \u201cI have heard that the superior\nman occupies the place for which he is adapted, accepting no reward to which he does not feel entitled, and\nnot covetous of honour and emolument. Now my doctrines are not practised in Ts\u2018e:\u2014I wish to leave it, but\nI think of your old age, and am anxious.\u201d His mother said, \u201cIt does not belong to a woman to determine any-\nthing of herself, but she is subject to the rule of the three obediences. When young, she has to obey her parents;\nwhen married, she has to obey her husband; when a widow, she has to obey her son. You are a man in your full\nmaturity, and I am old. Do you act as your conviction of righteousness tells you you ought to do, and I will act\naccording to the rule which belongs to me. Why should you be anxious about me?\u201d\nSuch are the accounts which I have found of the mother of Mencius. Possibly some of them are inventions,\nbut they are devoutly believed by the people of China;\u2014and it must be to their profit. We may well believe that\nshe was a woman of very superior character, and that her son\u2019s subsequent distinction was in a great degree\nowing to her influence and training.\n* * * * * *\nTHE ZHUAnGZI\nZhuangzi (ca. 369-286 B.C.E.)\nCompiled ca. the fourth century C.E.\nChina\nThe Zhuangzi, also known as Nanhua zhenjing (\u201cThe Pure Classic of Nanhua\u201d), is regarded as a primary source\nfor Daoism, along with Daodejing (a.k.a. the Laozi) and the Liezi. Out of thirty-three chapters, the first seven chap-\nters, called the \u201cinner books,\u201d are attributed to Zhuangzi, whereas the other chapters, called the \u201couter books,\u201d are\ncredited to the later followers of Zhuangzi. The current arrangement of the book is credited to Guo Xiang in the 4th\ncentury C.E.\nIn contrast to Confucianism, Zhuangzi believed that a truly virtuous man is free from socio-political bounds\nand obligations, personal attachments, and tradition. Scholars still find the Zhuangzi, written in reflective, serious,\nand sometimes playful ways, puzzling, but it certainly engages the ideas of relativity, paradox, and uncertainty. The\nmost famous of the Zhuangzi is the part about Zhuangzi dreaming of being a butterfly, which is located at the end\nof the second chapter. Because the transcription of Chinese sounds into a Roman alphabet can vary, Zhuangzi has\nbeen spelled in various ways, such as Chuang Tzu, Chuang-tsze, Chuang Chou, Zhuangzi, Zhuang Tze, Zhuang\nZhou, Chuang Tsu, Chouang-Dsi, Chuang Tse, and Chuangtze.\nWritten by Kyounghye Kwon\nThe Adjustment of Controversies\nLicense: Public Domain\nChuang Tzu, Translated by James Legge\n(1)\nNan-Guo Zi-Qi was seated, leaning forward on his stool. He was looking up to heaven and breathed gently,\nseeming to be in a trance, and to have lost all consciousness of any companion. (His disciple), Yan Cheng Zi-You,\nwho was in attendance and standing before him, said, \u201cWhat is this? Can the body be made to become thus like a\nwithered tree, and the mind to become like slaked lime? His appearance as he leans forward on the stool today is\nsuch as I never saw him have before in the same position.\u201d Zi-Qi said, \u201cYan, you do well to ask such a question, I\nhad just now lost myself; but how should you understand it? You may have heard the notes of Man, but have not\nheard those of Earth; you may have heard the notes of Earth, but have not heard those of Heaven.\u201d\nZi-You said, \u201cI venture to ask from you a description of all these.\u201d The reply was, \u201cWhen the breath of the Great\nMass (of nature) comes strongly, it is called Wind. Sometimes it does not come so; but when it does, then from a\n465 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nmyriad apertures there issues its excited noise; have you not heard it in a prolonged gale? Take the projecting bluff\nof a mountain forest\u2014in the great trees, a hundred spans round, the apertures and cavities are like the nostrils,\nor the mouth, or the ears; now square, now round like a cup or a mortar; here like a wet footprint, and there like\na large puddle. (The sounds issuing from them are like) those of fretted water, of the arrowy whizz, of the stern\ncommand, of the inhaling of the breath, of the shout, of the gruff note, of the deep wail, of the sad and piping note.\nThe first notes are slight, and those that follow\ndeeper, but in harmony with them. Gentle\nwinds produce a small response; violent winds\na great one. When the fierce gusts have passed\naway, all the apertures are empty (and still)\u2014\nhave you not seen this in the bending and\nquivering of the branches and leaves?\u201d\nZi-You said, \u201cThe notes of Earth then are\nsimply those which come from its myriad\napertures; and the notes of Man may just be\ncompared to those which (are brought from\nthe tubes of) bamboo\u2014allow me to ask about\nthe notes of Heaven.\u201d Zi-Qi replied, \u201cBlowing\nthe myriad differences, making them stop\n[proceed] of themselves, sealing their self-se-\nlecting\u2014who is it that stirs it all up?\u201d\n(2)\nGreat knowledge is wide and comprehen-\nsive; small knowledge is partial and restricted.\nImage 2.4: Zhuangzi Butterfly Dream | Zhuangzi illustrates his idea of\nGreat speech is exact and complete; small\n\u201ctransformation of things\u201d with his butterfly dream.\nspeech is (merely) so much talk.

To be constantly toiling\n466 The Zhuangzi\nall one\u2019s lifetime, without seeing the fruit of one\u2019s labour, and to be weary and worn out with his labour, without\nknowing where he is going to\u2014is it not a deplorable case? Men may say, \u201cBut it is not death;\u201d yet of what advantage\nis this? When the body is decomposed, the mind will be the same along with it\u2014must not the case be pronounced\nvery deplorable? Is the life of man indeed enveloped in such darkness? Is it I alone to whom it appears so? And does\nit not appear to be so to other men?\n(4)\nIf we were to follow the judgments of the predetermined mind, who would be left alone and without a teach-\ner? Not only would it be so with those who know the sequences (of knowledge and feeling) and make their own\nselection among them, but it would be so as well with the stupid and unthinking. For one who has not this deter-\nmined mind, to have his affirmations and negations is like the case described in the saying, \u201cHe went to Yue to-day,\nand arrived at it yesterday.\u201d It would be making what was not a fact to be a fact. But even the spirit-like Yu could\nnot have known how to do this, and how should one like me be able to do it? But speech is not like the blowing (of\nthe wind); the speaker has (a meaning in) his words. If, however, what he says, be indeterminate (as from a mind\nnot made up), does he then really speak or not? He thinks that his words are different from the chirpings of fledgel-\nings; but is there any distinction between them or not? But how can the Dao be so obscured, that there should be \u201ca\nTrue\u201d and \u201ca False\u201d in it? How can speech be so obscured that there should be \u201cthe Right\u201d and \u201cthe Wrong\u201d about\nthem? Where shall the Dao go to that it will not be found? Where shall speech be found that it will be inappro-\npriate? Dao becomes obscured through the small comprehension (of the mind), and speech comes to be obscure\nthrough the vain-gloriousness (of the speaker). So it is that we have the contentions between the Literati and the\nMohists, the one side affirming what the other denies, and vice versa. If we would decide on their several affirma-\ntions and denials, no plan is like bringing the (proper) light (of the mind) to bear on them.\n(5)\nThere is no thing that is not \u201cthat\u201d, and there is no thing that is not \u201cthis\u201d. If I look at something from \u201cthat\u201d, I do\nnot see it; only if I look at it from knowing do I know it. Hence it is said, \u201cThat view comes from this; and this view\nis a consequence of that:\u201d\u2014which is the theory that that view and this (the opposite views) produce each the other.\nAlthough it be so, there is affirmed now life and now death; now death and now life; now the admissibility of a thing\nand now its inadmissibility; now its inadmissibility and now its admissibility. (The disputants) now affirm and now\ndeny; now deny and now affirm. Therefore the sagely man does not pursue this method, but views things in the light\nof (his) Heaven (-ly nature), and hence forms his judgment of what is right. This view is the same as that, and that view\nis the same as this. But that view involves both a right and a wrong; and this view involves also a right and a wrong\u2014\nare there indeed the two views, that and this? Or are there not the two views, that and this? They have not found their\npoint of correspondency which is called the pivot of the Dao. As soon as one finds this pivot, he stands in the centre\nof the ring (of thought), where he can respond without end to the changing views; without end to those affirming, and\nwithout end to those denying. Therefore I said, \u201cThere is nothing like the proper light (of the mind).\u201d\n(6)\nBy means of a finger (of my own) to illustrate that the finger (of another) is not a finger is not so good a plan\nas to illustrate that it is not so by means of what is (acknowledged to be) not a finger; and by means of (what I call)\na horse to illustrate that (what another calls) a horse is not so, is not so good a plan as to illustrate that it is not a\nhorse, by means of what is (acknowledged to be) not a horse. (All things in) heaven and earth may be (dealt with\nas) a finger; (each of) their myriads may be (dealt with as) a horse.\nDoes a thing seem so to me? (I say that) it is so. Does it seem not so to me? (I say that) it is not so. A path is\nformed by (constant) treading on the ground. A thing is called by its name through the (constant) application of\nthe name to it. How is it so? It is so because it is so. How is it not so? It is not so, because it is not so. Everything\nhas its inherent character and its proper capability. There is nothing which has not these. Therefore, this being so,\nif we take a stalk of grain and a (large) pillar, a loathsome (leper) and (a beauty like) Xi Shi, things large and things\ninsecure, things crafty and things strange; they may in the light of the Dao all be reduced to the same category (of\nopinion about them).\nIt was separation that led to completion; from completion ensued dissolution. But all things, without regard to\ntheir completion and dissolution, may again be comprehended in their unity\u2014it is only the far reaching in thought\nwho know how to comprehend them in this unity. This being so, let us give up our devotion to our own views, and\noccupy ourselves with the ordinary views. These ordinary views are grounded on the use of things. (The study of\nthat) use leads to the comprehensive judgment, and that judgment secures the success (of the inquiry). That success\ngained, we are near (to the object of our search), and there we stop. When we stop, and yet we do not know how it\n467 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nis so, we have what is called the Dao. When we toil our spirits and intelligence, obstinately determined (to establish\nour own view), and do not know the agreement (which underlies it and the views of others), we have what is called\n\u201cIn the morning three.\u201d What is meant by that \u201cIn the morning three?\u201d A keeper of monkeys, in giving them out\ntheir acorns, (once) said, \u201cIn the morning I will give you three (measures) and in the evening four.\u201d This made them\nall angry, and he said, \u201cVery well. In the morning I will give you four and in the evening three.\u201d The monkeys were\nall pleased. His two proposals were substantially the same, but the result of the one was to make the creatures angry,\nand of the other to make them pleased\u2014an illustration of the point I am insisting on. Therefore the sagely man\nbrings together a dispute in its affirmations and denials, and rests in the equal fashioning of Heaven. Both sides of\nthe question are admissible.\n(7)\nAmong the men of old their knowledge reached the extreme point. What was that extreme point? Some held\nthat at first there was not anything. This is the extreme point, the utmost point to which nothing can be added. A\nsecond class held that there was something, but without any responsive recognition of it (on the part of men). A\nthird class held that there was such recognition, but there had not begun to be any expression of different opinions\nabout it. It was through the definite expression of different opinions about it that there ensued injury to (the doc-\ntrine of) the Dao. It was this injury to the (doctrine of the) Dao which led to the formation of (partial) preferences.\nWas it indeed after such preferences were formed that the injury came? or did the injury precede the rise of such\npreferences? If the injury arose after their formation, Zhao\u2019s method of playing on the lute was natural. If the injury\narose before their formation, there would have been no such playing on the lute as Zhao\u2019s. Zhao Wen\u2019s playing on\nthe lute, Shi Kuang\u2019s indicating time with his staff, and Huizi\u2019s (giving his views), while leaning against a dryandra\ntree (were all extraordinary). The knowledge of the three men (in their several arts) was nearly perfect, and there-\nfore they practised them to the end of their lives. They loved them because they were different from those of others.\nThey loved them and wished to make them known to others. But as they could not be made clear, though they tried\nto make them so, they ended with the obscure (discussions) about \u201cthe hard\u201d and \u201cthe white.\u201d And their sons, more-\nover, with all the threads of their fathers\u2019 compositions, yet to the end of their lives accomplished nothing. If they,\nproceeding in this way, could be said to have succeeded, then am I also successful; if they cannot be pronounced\nsuccessful, neither I nor any other can succeed. Therefore the scintillations of light from the midst of confusion\nand perplexity are indeed valued by the sagely man; but not to use one\u2019s own views and to take his position on the\nordinary views is what is called using the (proper) light.\n(8)\nBut here now are some other sayings\u2014I do not know whether they are of the same character as those which I\nhave already given, or of a different character. Whether they be of the same character or not when looked at along\nwith them, they have a character of their own, which cannot be distinguished from the others. But though this be\nthe case, let me try to explain myself. There was a beginning. There was a beginning before that beginning. There\nwas a beginning previous to that beginning before there was the beginning. There was existence; there had been\nno existence. There was no existence before the beginning of that no existence. There was no existence previous to\nthe no existence before there was the beginning of the no existence. If suddenly there was nonexistence, we do not\nknow whether it was really anything existing, or really not existing. Now I have said what I have said, but I do not\nknow whether what I have said be really anything to the point or not.\n(9)\nUnder heaven there is nothing greater than the tip of an autumn down, and the Tai mountain is small. There is\nno one more long-lived than a child which dies prematurely, and Peng Zu did not live out his time. Heaven, Earth,\nand I were produced together, and all things and I are one. Since they are one, can there be speech about them? But\nsince they are spoken of as one, must there not be room for speech? One and Speech are two; two and one are three.\nGoing on from this (in our enumeration), the most skilful reckoner cannot reach (the end of the necessary num-\nbers), and how much less can ordinary people do so! Therefore from non-existence we proceed to existence till we\narrive at three; proceeding from existence to existence, to how many should we reach? Let us abjure such procedure,\nand simply rest here.\n(10)\nThe Dao at first met with no responsive recognition. Speech at first had no constant forms of expression. Be-\ncause of this there came the demarcations (of different views). Let me describe those demarcations: they are the Left\n468 The Zhuangzi\nand the Right; the Relations and their Obligations; Classifications and their Distinctions; Emulations and Conten-\ntions. These are what are called \u201cthe Eight Qualities.\u201d Outside the limits of the world of men, the sage occupies his\nthoughts, but does not discuss about anything; inside those limits he occupies his thoughts, but does not pass any\njudgments. In the Chun Qiu, which embraces the history of the former kings, the sage indicates his judgments,\nbut does not argue (in vindication of them). Thus it is that he separates his characters from one another without\nappearing to do so, and argues without the form of argument. How does he do so? The sage cherishes his views in\nhis own breast, while men generally state theirs argumentatively, to show them to others. Hence we have the saying,\n\u201cDisputation is a proof of not seeing clearly.\u201d\nThe Great Dao does not admit of being praised. The Great Argument does not require words. Great Benevo-\nlence is not (officiously) benevolent. Great Disinterestedness does not vaunt its humility. Great Courage is not seen\nin stubborn bravery. The Dao that is displayed is not the Dao. Words that are argumentative do not reach the point.\nBenevolence that is constantly exercised does not accomplish its object. Disinterestedness that vaunts its purity is\nnot genuine. Courage that is most stubborn is ineffectual. These five seem to be round (and complete), but they\ntend to become square (and immovable). Therefore the knowledge that stops at what it does not know is the great-\nest. Who knows the argument that needs no words, and the Way that is not to be trodden? He who is able to know\nthis has what is called \u201cThe Heavenly Treasure-house.\u201d He may pour into it without its being filled; he may pour\nfrom it without its being exhausted; and all the while he does not know whence (the supply) comes. This is what is\ncalled \u201cThe Store of Light.\u201d Therefore of old Yao asked Shun, saying, \u201cI wish to smite (the rulers of) Zong, Kuai, and\nXu-Ao. Even when standing in my court, I cannot get them out of my mind. How is it so?\u201d Shun replied, \u201cThose\nthree rulers live (in their little states) as if they were among the mugwort and other brushwood\u2014how is it that you\ncannot get them out of your mind? Formerly, ten suns came out together, and all things were illuminated by them;\nhow much should (your) virtue exceed (all) suns!\u201d\n(11)\nNie Que asked Wang Ni, saying, \u201cDo you know, Sir, what all creatures agree in approving and affirming?\u201d \u201cHow\nshould I know it?\u201d was the reply. \u201cDo you know what it is that you do not know?\u201d asked the other again, and he got\nthe same reply. He asked a third time, \u201cThen are all creatures thus without knowledge?\u201d and Wang Ni answered\nas before, (adding however), \u201cNotwithstanding, I will try and explain my meaning. How do you know that when I\nsay \u2018I know it,\u2019 I really (am showing that) I do not know it, and that when I say \u2018I do not know it,\u2019 I really am show-\ning that I do know it.\u201d And let me ask you some questions: \u201cIf a man sleep in a damp place, he will have a pain in\nhis loins, and half his body will be as if it were dead; but will it be so with an eel? If he be living in a tree, he will\nbe frightened and all in a tremble; but will it be so with a monkey? And does any one of the three know his right\nplace? Men eat animals that have been fed on grain and grass; deer feed on the thick-set grass; centipedes enjoy\nsmall snakes; owls and crows delight in mice; but does any one of the four know the right taste? The dog-headed\nmonkey finds its mate in the female gibbon; the elk and the axis deer cohabit; and the eel enjoys itself with other\nfishes. Mao Qiang and Li Ji were accounted by men to be most beautiful, but when fishes saw them, they dived deep\nin the water from them; when birds, they flew from them aloft; and when deer saw them, they separated and fled\naway. But did any of these four know which in the world is the right female attraction? As I look at the matter, the\nfirst principles of benevolence and righteousness and the paths of approval and disapproval are inextricably mixed\nand confused together\u2014how is it possible that I should know how to discriminate among them?\u201d Nie Que said\n(further), \u201cSince you, Sir, do not know what is advantageous and what is hurtful, is the Perfect man also in the same\nway without the knowledge of them?\u201d Wang Ni replied, \u201cThe Perfect man is spirit-like. Great lakes might be boiling\nabout him, and he would not feel their heat; the He and the Han might be frozen up, and he would not feel the cold;\nthe hurrying thunderbolts might split the mountains, and the wind shake the ocean, without being able to make\nhim afraid. Being such, he mounts on the clouds of the air, rides on the sun and moon, and rambles at ease beyond\nthe four seas. Neither death nor life makes any change in him, and how much less should the considerations of\nadvantage and injury do so!\u201d\n(12)\nQu Quezi asked Chang Wuzi, saying, \u201cI heard the Master (speaking of such language as the following): \u2018The\nsagely man does not occupy himself with worldly affairs. He does not put himself in the way of what is profitable,\nnor try to avoid what is hurtful; he has no pleasure in seeking (for anything from any one); he does not care to be\nfound in (any established) Way; he speaks without speaking; he does not speak when he speaks; thus finding his\nenjoyment outside the dust and dirt (of the world).\u2019 The Master considered all this to be a shoreless flow of mere\nwords, and I consider it to describe the course of the Mysterious Way\u2014What do you, Sir, think of it?\u201d Chang Wuzi\nreplied, \u201cThe hearing of such words would have perplexed even Huang Di, and how should Qiu be competent to\n469 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nunderstand them? And you, moreover, are too hasty in forming your estimate (of their meaning). You see the egg,\nand (immediately) look out for the cock (that is to be hatched from it); you see the bow, and (immediately) look out\nfor the dove (that is to be brought down by it) being roasted. I will try to explain the thing to you in a rough way;\ndo you in the same way listen to me. How could any one stand by the side of the sun and moon, and hold under his\narm all space and all time? (Such language only means that the sagely man) keeps his mouth shut, and puts aside\nquestions that are uncertain and dark; making his inferior capacities unite with him in honouring (the One Lord).\nMen in general bustle about and toil; the sagely man seems stupid and to know nothing. He blends ten thousand\nyears together in the one (conception of time); the myriad things all pursue their spontaneous course, and they\nare all before him as doing so. How do I know that the love of life is not a delusion? and that the dislike of death is\nnot like a young person\u2019s losing his way, and not knowing that he is (really) going home? Li Ji was a daughter of the\nborder Warden of Ai. When (the ruler of) the state of Jin first got possession of her, she wept till the tears wetted all\nthe front of her dress. But when she came to the place of the king, shared with him his luxurious couch, and ate his\ngrain-and-grass-fed meat, then she regretted that she had wept. How do I know that the dead do not repent of their\nformer craving for life? Those who dream of (the pleasures of) drinking may in the morning wail and weep; those\nwho dream of wailing and weeping may in the morning be going out to hunt. When they were dreaming they did\nnot know it was a dream; in their dream they may even have tried to interpret it; but when they awoke they knew\nthat it was a dream. And there is the great awaking, after which we shall know that this life was a great dream. All\nthe while, the stupid think they are awake, and with nice discrimination insist on their knowledge; now playing\nthe part of rulers, and now of grooms. Bigoted was that Qiu! He and you are both dreaming. I who say that you are\ndreaming am dreaming myself. These words seem very strange; but if after ten thousand ages we once meet with a\ngreat sage who knows how to explain them, it will be as if we met him (unexpectedly) some morning or evening.\n\u201cSince you made me enter into this discussion with you, if you have got the better of me and not I of you, are\nyou indeed right, and I indeed wrong? If I have got the better of you and not you of me, am I indeed right and you\nindeed wrong? Is the one of us right and the other wrong? are we both right or both wrong? Since we cannot come\nto a mutual and common understanding, men will certainly continue in darkness on the subject. Whom shall I\nemploy to adjudicate in the matter? If I employ one who agrees with you, how can he, agreeing with you, do so\ncorrectly? If I employ one who agrees with me, how can he, agreeing with me, do so correctly? If I employ one who\ndisagrees with you and I, how can he, disagreeing with you and I, do so correctly? If I employ one who agrees with\nyou and I, how can he, agreeing with you and I, do so correctly? In this way I and you and those others would all\nnot be able to come to a mutual understanding; and shall we then wait for that (great sage)? (We need not do so.) To\nwait on others to learn how conflicting opinions are changed is simply like not so waiting at all. The harmonising\nof them is to be found in the invisible operation of Heaven, and by following this on into the unlimited past. It is by\nthis method that we can complete our years (without our minds being disturbed). What is meant by harmonising\n(conflicting opinions) in the invisible operation of Heaven? There is the affirmation and the denial of it; and there\nis the assertion of an opinion and the rejection of it. If the affirmation be according to the reality of the fact, it is cer-\ntainly different from the denial of it\u2014there can be no dispute about that. If the assertion of an opinion be correct, it\nis certainly different from its rejection\u2014neither can there be any dispute about that. Let us forget the lapse of time;\nlet us forget the conflict of opinions. Let us make our appeal to the Infinite, and take up our position there.\u201d\n(13)\nThe Penumbra asked the Shadow, saying, \u201cFormerly you were walking on, and now you have stopped; formerly\nyou were sitting, and now you have risen up\u2014how is it that you are so without stability?\u201d The Shadow replied, \u201cI\nwait for the movements of something else to do what I do, and that something else on which I wait waits further on\nanother to do as it does. My waiting, is it for the scales of a snake, or the wings of a cicada? How should I know why\nI do one thing, or do not do another?\u201d\n(14)\n\u201cFormerly, I, Zhuang Zhou, dreamt that I was a butterfly, a butterfly flying about, feeling that it was enjoying itself.\nI did not know that it was Zhou. Suddenly I awoke, and was myself again, the veritable Zhou. I did not know whether\nit had formerly been Zhou dreaming that he was a butterfly, or it was now a butterfly dreaming that it was Zhou. But\nbetween Zhou and a butterfly there must be a difference. This is a case of what is called the Transformation of Things.\u201d\n470 3\nIndia\nThe works in this chapter were written down starting around the 4th century B.C.E., but the three stories date\nback to much earlier in the oral tradition. All three works remain influential and ubiquitous in Indian society to this\nday: common knowledge that everyone knows, at least in some part. Rather than offering a list of values and beliefs,\nthe stories demonstrate them in action: how to approach complicated moral issues, and what to do when life seems\nunfair. The answer is not always easy, and sometimes the choice is between two options that are not ideal. The best\nchoice is often the most difficult one, and the expectations of society for these characters can seem overwhelming.\nThe intervention of the gods in these cases becomes absolutely necessary. The Bhagavad-Gita is the most directly\nreligious work, containing as it does the teaching of the god Vishnu through his avatar Krishna, but the other two\ntexts include direct participation of gods (and their avatars) in the stories. Therefore, some basic information about\nHinduism is necessary for a clear understanding of the texts:\nThe one god is Brahman, who both binds the universe together and transcends it. The consciousness of Brah-\nman is divided into three parts, which worshippers address individually:\n\u2022 Brahma, the Creator\n\u2022 Vishnu, the Preserver\n\u2022 Shiva, the Destroyer\nEach of them is represented by hundreds of minor Hindu gods, who represent aspects of these three and can\nfunction separately while still remaining part of the whole (and all of them are part of Brahman). Gods also can\nsend down avatars\u2014pieces of their consciousness that are born, live, and die as humans\u2014to intervene when neces-\nsary.\nIn all three works, a belief in samsara\u2014the cycle of reincarnation\u2014drives the characters\u2019 behavior. An individ-\nual can move up or down the hierarchy in society based on their karma (the sum of their good and bad deeds), but\nonly in their next reincarnation. For each person, the concept of dharma (doing what one is supposed to do, right\nbehavior, Law) is slightly different: A warrior who takes an oath (no matter how crazy an oath it is) must fulfill his\noath, because keeping one\u2019s word is part of a warrior\u2019s honor. Not fulfilling an oath is adharma (described as Unlaw\nin the texts). A farmer, however, should behave like a good farmer, rather than a warrior, and good farmers do not\ntake crazy oaths or act in ways that could damage their ability to plant and harvest a crop. Farmers also should not\ntry to become warriors. Social mobility, therefore, is not only discouraged, but irreligious in that context. This idea\ndrives the caste system, forcing people to remain in their caste or face being made an Untouchable.\nEach character is born into a caste, or Varna, which determines what they can and cannot do, and each Varna is\nbroken down into numerous Jats, or communities:\n\u2022 Brahmins, the priests and scholars, are the highest Varna.\n\u2022 Kshatriyas, the rulers and the military, are the next level.\n\u2022 Vaishyas are the farmers, landlords, and merchants.\n\u2022 Sudras are peasants, servants, and workers in non-polluting jobs.\nThe Dalit, or Untouchables, are workers in what are considered polluting jobs. In some places, even contact\nwith the shadow of an Untouchable was considered polluting. In some parts of India (mostly rural districts), the\ncaste system continues, despite government attempts to stop it.\nCharacters need to be the best they can be (following their individual dharma) in the Varna and Jat into which\n471 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthey were born in order to move up the hierarchy in their next reincarnation. They are expected not only to work in\ntheir Jat, but to marry within it. Certain problems in The Mahabharata are a direct result of characters who do not\nstay in their Jat (or even their Varna), and the story warns us that trouble, and even disaster, will follow.\nAs you read, consider the following questions:\n\u2022 What is this society\u2019s definition of an epic hero? How do we know, based on examples from the stories\nthemselves?\n\u2022 How do the characters view the gods, and how do the gods treat humans?\n\u2022 What do we learn about what this society considers proper or improper behavior, again based on the text\nitself? Who is punished or rewarded, and why?\n\u2022 Is family love or romantic love more important in the text, and why?\nWritten by Laura J. Getty\nTHE BHAGAVAD GITA\nAdded to The Mahabharata between 400 B.C.E. and 400 C.E.\nIndia\nThe Bhagavad Gita records the conversation between Krishna and Arjuna right before the epic battle of Kuruk-\nshetra. Although it is a part of The Mahabharata, it often is taught separately for its insights into Hindu beliefs. Krish-\nna is the eighth human avatar of the god Vishnu, who sends down an avatar every time that the world requires such\nserious divine intervention that the good side could not win without his help. In this instance, the warrior Arjuna\nfinds himself in a difficult position; to fight a war against evil, he must fight members of his own family, which would\nnormally be a sin. Krishna must teach Arjuna how to know what to do when faced with conflicting duties. Some of\nthe tension of the work comes from the setting; Krishna and Arjuna are literally between the two armies as they talk,\nwhile both sides wait for Arjuna to blow his horn, which will start the battle. The Bhagavad Gita stands as one of the\ngreat moral documents in world literature, influencing people as diverse as Thoreau, Tolstoy, and Gandhi.\nWritten by Laura J. Getty\nThe Bhagavad Gita\nLicense: Open Access\nTranslated by Ramananda Prasad\nChapter 1\nArjuna\u2019s Dilemma\nThe war of Mahabharata has begun after all negotiations by Lord Krishna and others to avoid it failed. The blind\nKing (Dhritarashtra) was never very sure about the victory of his sons (Kauravas) in spite of their superior army. Sage\nVyasa, the author of Mahabharata, wanted to give the blind King the boon of eyesight so that the King could see the\nhorrors of the war for which he was primarily responsible. But the King refused the offer. He did not want to see the\nhorrors of the war; but preferred to get the war report through his charioteer, Sanjaya. Sage Vyasa granted the power\nof clairvoyance to Sanjaya. With this power Sanjaya could see, hear, and recall the events of the past, present, and the\nfuture. He was able to give an instant replay of the eyewitness war report to the blind King sitting in the palace.\nBhishma, the mightiest man and the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava\u2019s army, is disabled by Arjuna and is lying\non deathbed in the battleground on the tenth day of the eighteen day war. Upon hearing this bad news from Sanjaya,\nthe blind King looses all hopes for victory of his sons. Now the King wants to know the details of the war from the begin-\nning, including how the mightiest man, and the commander-in-chief of his superior army\u2014who had a boon of dying\nat his own will\u2014was defeated in the battlefield. The teaching of the Gita begins with the inquiry of the blind King, after\nSanjaya described how Bhishma was defeated, as follows:\nThe King inquired: Sanjaya, please now tell me, in details, what did my people (the Kauravas) and the Pandavas\ndo in the battlefield before the war started?\n472 The Bhagavad Gita\nSanjaya said: O King, After seeing the battle formation of the Pandava\u2019s army, your son approached his guru\nand spoke these words:\nO Master, behold this mighty army of the Pandavas, arranged in battle formation by your other talented disci-\nple! There are many great warriors, valiant men, heroes, and mighty archers.\nIntroduction Of The Army Commanders\nAlso there are many heroes on my side who have risked their lives for me. I shall name few distinguished\ncommanders of my army for your information. He named all the officers of his army, and said: They are armed with\nvarious weapons, and are skilled in warfare.\nOur army is invincible, while their army is easy to conquer. Therefore all of you, occupying your respective\npositions, protect our commander-in-chief.\nWar Starts With The Blowing Of Conch Shells\nThe mighty commander-in-chief and the eldest man of the dynasty, roared as a lion and blew his conch loudly,\nbringing joy to your son.\nSoon after that; conches, kettledrums, cymbals, drums, and trumpets were sounded together. The commotion\nwas tremendous.\nAfter that, Lord Krishna and Arjuna, seated in a grand chariot yoked with white horses, blew their celestial\nconches.\nKrishna blew His conch first, and then Arjuna and all other commanders of various divisions of the army of\nPandavas blew their respective conches. The tumultuous uproar, resounding through the earth and sky, tore the\nhearts of your sons.\nArjuna Wants To Inspect The Army Against Whom He Is About To Fight\nSeeing your sons standing, and the war about to begin with the hurling of weapons; Arjuna, whose banner\nbore the emblem of Lord Hanumana, took up his bow and spoke these words to Lord Krishna: O Lord, please stop\nmy chariot between the two armies until I behold those who stand here eager for the battle and with whom I must\nengage in this act of war.\nI wish to see those who are willing to serve and appease the evil-minded Kauravas by assembling here to fight\nthe battle.\nSanjaya said: O King; Lord Krishna, as requested by Arjuna, placed the best of all the chariots in the midst of\nthe two armies facing Arjuna\u2019s grandfather, his guru and all other Kings; and said to Arjuna: Behold these assem-\nbled soldiers!\nArjuna saw his uncles, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, and other comrades\nin the army.\nArjuna\u2019s Dilemma\nAfter seeing fathers-in-law, companions, and all his kinsmen standing in the ranks of the two armies, Arjuna\nwas overcome with great compassion and sorrowfully spoke these words: O Krishna, seeing my kinsmen standing\nwith a desire to fight, my limbs fail and my mouth becomes dry. My body quivers and my hairs stand on end.\nThe bow slips from my hand, and my skin intensely burns. My head turns, I am unable to stand steady, and O\nKrishna, I see bad omens. I see no use of killing my kinsmen in battle.\nI desire neither victory, nor pleasure nor kingdom, O Krishna. What is the use of the kingdom, or enjoyment,\nor even life, O Krishna? Because all those\u2014for whom we desire kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures\u2014are standing\nhere for the battle, giving up their lives.\nI do not wish to kill my teachers, uncles, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, broth-\ners-in-law, and other relatives who are about to kill us, even for the sovereignty of the three worlds, let alone for this\nearthly kingdom, O Krishna.\nO Lord Krishna, what pleasure shall we find in killing our cousin brothers? Upon killing these felons we shall\nincur sin only.\nTherefore, we should not kill our cousin brothers. How can we be happy after killing our relatives, O Krishna?\nThough they are blinded by greed, and do not see evil in the destruction of the family, or sin in being treacher-\nous to friends. Why should not we, who clearly see evil in the destruction of the family, think about turning away\nfrom this sin, O Krishna?\n473 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nArjuna Describes the Evils of War\nEternal family traditions and codes of moral conduct are destroyed with the destruction of the family. And\nimmorality prevails in the family due to the destruction of family traditions.\nAnd when immorality prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupted; when women are cor-\nrupted, unwanted progeny is born.\nThis brings the family and the slayers of the family to hell, because the spirits of their ancestors are degraded\nwhen deprived of ceremonial offerings of love and respect by the unwanted progeny.\nThe everlasting qualities of social order and family traditions of those who destroy their family are ruined by\nthe sinful act of illegitimacy.\nWe have been told, O Krishna, that people whose family traditions are destroyed necessarily dwell in hell for a\nlong time.\nAlas! We are ready to commit a great sin by striving to slay our relatives because of greed for the pleasures of\nthe kingdom.\nIt would be far better for me if my cousin brothers kill me with their weapons in battle while I am unarmed and\nunresisting.\nWhen Going Gets Tough, Even Tough Ones Can Get Deluded\nSanjaya said: Having said this in the battlefield and casting aside his bow and arrow, Arjuna sat down on the\nseat of the chariot with his mind overwhelmed with sorrow.\nChapter 2\nTranscendental Knowledge\nSanjaya said: Lord Krishna spoke these words to Arjuna whose eyes were tearful and downcast, and who was\noverwhelmed with compassion and despair.\nLord Krishna said: How has the dejection come to you at this juncture? This is not fit for a person of noble\nmind and deeds. It is disgraceful, and it does not lead one to heaven, O Arjuna.\nDo not become a coward, O Arjuna, because it does not befit you. Shake off this trivial weakness of your heart\nand get up for the battle, O Arjuna.\nArjuna Continues His Reasoning Against The War\nArjuna said: How shall I strike my grandfather, my guru, and all other relatives, who are worthy of my respect,\nwith arrows in battle, O Krishna?\nIt would be better, indeed, to live on alms in this world than to slay these noble personalities, because by killing\nthem I would enjoy wealth and pleasures stained with their blood.\nWe do not know which alternative\u2014to fight or to quit\u2014is better for us. Further, we do not know whether we\nshall conquer them or they will conquer us. We should not even wish to live after killing our cousin brothers, who\nare standing in front of us.\nMy senses are overcome by the weakness of pity, and my mind is confused about duty (Dharma). Please tell me\nwhat is better for me. I am Your disciple, and I take refuge in You.\nI do not perceive that gaining an unrivaled and prosperous kingdom on this earth, or even lordship over all the\ncelestial controllers will remove the sorrow that is drying up my senses.\nSanjaya said: O King, after speaking like this to Lord Krishna, the mighty Arjuna said to Krishna: I shall not\nfight, and became silent.\nO King, Lord Krishna, as if smiling, spoke these words to the distressed Arjuna in the midst of the two armies.\nThe Teachings Of The Gita Begin With The True Knowledge Of Spirit And The Physical Body\nLord Krishna said: you grieve for those who are not worthy of grief, and yet speak words of wisdom. The\nwise grieves neither for the living nor for the dead.\nThere was never a time when these monarchs, you, or I did not exist; nor shall we ever cease to exist in the\nfuture.\nJust as the soul acquires a childhood body, a youth body, and an old age body during this life; similarly, the\nsoul acquires another body after death. This should not delude the wise.\nThe contacts of the senses with the sense objects give rise to the feelings of heat and cold, and pain and plea-\nsure. They are transitory and impermanent. Therefore, one should learn to endure them.\n474 The Bhagavad Gita\nBecause a calm person\u2014who is not afflicted by these sense objects, and is steady in pain and pleasure\u2014be-\ncomes fit for salvation.\nThe Spirit Is Eternal, Body Is Transitory\nThe invisible Spirit (Atma, Atman) is eternal, and the visible physical body, is transitory. The reality of these two\nis indeed certainly seen by the seers of truth.\nThe Spirit by whom this entire universe is pervaded is indestructible. No one can destroy the imperishable\nSpirit.\nThe physical bodies of the eternal, immutable, and incomprehensible Spirit are perishable. Therefore fight, O\nArjuna.\nThe one who thinks that the Spirit is a slayer, and the one who thinks the Spirit is slain, both are ignorant.\nBecause the Spirit neither slays nor is slain.\nThe Spirit is neither born nor does it die at any time. It does not come into being, or cease to exist. It is unborn,\neternal, permanent, and primeval. The Spirit is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.\nO Arjuna, how can a person who knows that the Spirit is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable, kill\nanyone or causes anyone to be killed?\nDeath And Transmigration Of Soul\nJust as a person puts on new garments after discarding the old ones; similarly, the living entity or the indi-\nvidual soul acquires new bodies after casting away the old bodies.\nWeapons do not cut this Spirit, fire does not burn it, water does not make it wet, and the wind does not make\nit dry. The Spirit cannot be cut, burned, wetted, or dried. It is eternal, all pervading, unchanging, immovable, and\nprimeval.\nThe Spirit is said to be unexplainable, incomprehensible, and unchanging. Knowing the Spirit as such you\nshould not grieve.\nEven if you think that the physical body takes birth and dies perpetually, even then, O Arjuna, you should not\ngrieve like this. Because death is certain for the one who is born, and birth is certain for the one who dies. There-\nfore, you should not lament over the inevitable.\nAll beings are unmanifest, or invisible to our physical eyes before birth and after death. They manifest\nbetween the birth and the death only. what is there to grieve about?\nThe Indestructible Spirit Transcends Mind And Speech\nSome look upon this Spirit as a wonder, another describes it as wonderful, and others hear of it as a wonder.\nEven after hearing about it very few people know what the Spirit is.\nO Arjuna, the Spirit that dwells in the body of all beings is eternally indestructible. Therefore, you should not\nmourn for anybody.\nLord Krishna Reminds Arjuna Of His Duty As A Warrior\nConsidering also your duty as a warrior you should not waver like this. Because there is nothing more auspi-\ncious for a warrior than a righteous war.\nOnly the fortunate warriors, O Arjuna, get such an opportunity for an unsought war that is like an open door to\nheaven.\nIf you will not fight this righteous war, then you will fail in your duty, lose your reputation, and incur sin.\nPeople will talk about your disgrace forever. To the honored, dishonor is worse than death.\nThe great warriors will think that you have retreated from the battle out of fear. Those who have greatly es-\nteemed you will lose respect for you.\nYour enemies will speak many unmentionable words and scorn your ability. What could be more painful to you\nthan this?\nYou will go to heaven if killed on the line of duty, or you will enjoy the kingdom on the earth if victorious.\nTherefore, get up with a determination to fight, O Arjuna.\nTreating pleasure and pain, gain and loss, and victory and defeat alike, engage yourself in your duty. By\ndoing your duty this way you will not incur sin.\n475 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nImportance Of Karma-Yoga, The Selfless Service\nThe science of transcendental knowledge has been imparted to you, O Arjuna. Now listen to the science of self-\nless service (Seva), endowed with which you will free yourself from all Karmic bondage, or sin.\nNo effort is ever lost in selfless service, and there is no adverse effect. Even a little practice of the discipline of\nselfless service protects one from the great fear of repeated birth and death.\nA selfless worker has resolute determination for God-realization, but the desires of the one who works to enjoy\nthe fruits of work are endless.\nThe Vedas Deal With Both Material And Spiritual Aspects Of Life\nThe misguided ones who delight in the melodious chanting of the Veda\u2014without understanding the real pur-\npose of the Vedas\u2014think, O Arjuna, as if there is nothing else in the Vedas except the rituals for the sole purpose of\nobtaining heavenly enjoyment.\nThey are dominated by material desires, and consider the attainment of heaven as the highest goal of life. They\nengage in specific rites for the sake of prosperity and enjoyment. Rebirth is the result of their action.\nThe resolute determination of Self-realization is not formed in the minds of those who are attached to pleasure\nand power, and whose judgment is obscured by ritualistic activities.\nA portion of the Vedas deals with three modes\u2014goodness, passion, and ignorance\u2014of material Nature. Be-\ncome free from pairs of opposites, be ever balanced and unconcerned with the thoughts of acquisition and preser-\nvation. Rise above these three modes, and be Self-conscious, O Arjuna.\nTo a Self-realized person the Vedas are as useful as a small reservoir of water when the water of a huge lake\nbecomes available.\nTheory And Practice Of Karma-Yoga\nyou have control over doing your respective duty only, but no control or claim over the results. The fruits\nof work should not be your motive, and you should never be inactive.\nDo your duty to the best of your ability, o Arjuna, with your mind attached to the Lord, abandoning worry\nand selfish attachment to the results, and remaining calm in both success and failure. The selfless service is a\nyogic practice that brings peace and equanimity of mind.\nWork done with selfish motives is inferior by far to the selfless service. Therefore be a selfless worker, O Arju-\nna. Those who work only to enjoy the fruits of their labor are verily unhappy, because one has no control over the\nresults.\nA Karma-yogi or the selfless person becomes free from both vice and virtue in this life itself. Therefore,\nstrive for selfless service. working to the best of one\u2019s abilities without becoming selfishly attached to the fruits\nof work is called Karma-yoga or Seva.\nKarma-yogis are freed from the bondage of rebirth due to renouncing the selfish attachment to the fruits of all\nwork, and attain blissful divine state of salvation or Nirvana.\nWhen your intellect will completely pierce the veil of confusion, then you will become indifferent to what has\nbeen heard and what is to be heard from the scriptures.\nWhen your intellect, that is confused by the conflicting opinions and the ritualistic doctrine of the Vedas,\nshall stay steady and firm on concentration of the Supreme Being, then you shall attain union with the Supreme in\ntrance.\nArjuna said: O Krishna, what are the marks of an enlightened person whose intellect is steady? What does a\nperson of steady intellect think and talk about? How does such a person behave with others, and live in this world?\nMarks Of A Self-Realized Person\nLord Krishna said: When one is completely free from all desires of the mind and is satisfied with the Supreme\nBeing by the joy of Supreme Being, then one is called an enlightened person, O Arjuna.\nA person whose mind is unperturbed by sorrow, who does not crave pleasures, and who is completely free\nfrom attachment, fear, and anger, is called an enlightened sage of steady intellect.\nThe mind and intellect of a person become steady who is not attached to anything, who is neither elated by\ngetting desired results, nor perturbed by undesired results.\nWhen one can completely withdraw the senses from the sense objects as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into the\nshell for protection from calamity, then the intellect of such a person is considered steady.\nThe desire for sensual pleasures fades away if one abstains from sense enjoyment, but the craving for sense\nenjoyment remains in a very subtle form. This subtle craving also completely disappears from the one who knows\nthe Supreme Being.\n476 The Bhagavad Gita\nDangers Of Unrestrained Senses\nrestless senses, o Arjuna, forcibly carry away the mind of even a wise person striving for perfection.\none should fix one\u2019s mind on God with loving contemplation after bringing the senses under control. one\u2019s\nintellect becomes steady when one\u2019s senses are under complete control.\none develops attachment to sense objects by thinking about sense objects. Desire for sense objects comes\nfrom attachment to sense objects, and anger comes from unfulfilled desires.\nDelusion or wild idea arises from anger. The mind is bewildered by delusion. Reasoning is destroyed when the\nmind is bewildered. One falls down from the right path when reasoning is destroyed.\nAttainment Of Peace And Happiness Through Sense Control And Knowledge\nA disciplined person, enjoying sense objects with senses that are under control and free from attachments and\naversions, attains tranquillity.\nAll sorrows are destroyed upon attainment of tranquillity. The intellect of such a tranquil person soon becomes\ncompletely steady and united with the Supreme.\nThere is neither Self-knowledge, nor Self-perception to those who are not united with the Supreme. Without\nSelf-perception there is no peace, and without peace there can be no happiness.\nBecause the mind, when controlled by the roving senses, steals away the intellect as a storm takes away a\nboat on the sea from its destination\u2014the spiritual shore of peace and happiness.\nTherefore, O Arjuna, one\u2019s intellect becomes steady whose senses are completely withdrawn from the sense objects.\nA yogi, the person of self-restraint, remains wakeful when it is night for all others. It is night for the yogi who\nsees when all others are wakeful.\none attains peace, within whose mind all desires dissipate without creating any mental disturbance, as\nriver waters enter the full ocean without creating any disturbance. one who desires material objects is never\npeaceful.\nOne who abandons all desires, and becomes free from longing and the feeling of \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018my\u2019, attains peace.\nO Arjuna, this is the superconscious state of mind. Attaining this state, one is no longer deluded. Gaining this\nstate, even at the end of one\u2019s life, a person becomes one with the Absolute.\nTHE MAHABHArATA\nWritten down between 400 B.C.E. and 400 C.E.\nIndia\nThe Mahabharata is the national epic of India, and it\nencapsulates ideas about morality, law, family relationships,\nclass structure (in the form of the caste system), and rein-\ncarnation. The basic conflict is between two sets of cousins,\nthe Pandavas and the Kauravas, who both have a legitimate\nclaim to the throne. The story is told through a series of\nnarrators, starting with Vyasa (a character in the story)\nand continuing down through time to a bard speaking to\na descendant of the winning side. Ultimately, the side that\nfollows dharma (and follows the words of the god Vishnu\nImage 3.1: wood Carving of a Scene from the\nin his human avatar of Krishna) will win. Dharma, which is\nMahabharata | The carving depicts Krishna and Arjuna\nboth a concept and the name of the god who embodies it, is\nfighting in the battle of Kurukshetra.\na difficult concept to translate: It includes morality, law, and\ndoing what is correct for your caste level, which can change Author: User \u201cthaths\u201d\nbased on your situation.

Although\nthe caste system was officially abolished in India in 1949, it remains a pervasive social force. The characters also\nhave a continuing presence in present-day society, with references to them in everything from comic Books and\nmovies to casual conversations.\n477 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThe Genealogy of the Main Characters in the Mahabharata:\nNote: Certain letters are dropped sometimes in writing (a form of abbreviation), with \u201ch\u201d being the most\ncommon casualty.

The major conflict is between two sets of cousins\u2014the pandavas (sons of Pandu) and\nthe Kauravas (sons of Dhritarashtra)\u2014who want to inherit the throne. Technically, both sets of cousins are Kurus,\nbut the Kauravas are referred to as Kurus more often in the story. Although they both have legitimate claims, the\nPandavas are considered the nobler of the cousins. The genealogy is complicated, but the basic idea is straightfor-\nward: the cousins will fight until one side wins. Since the Kauravas are (mostly) evil, there are religious reasons for\nthe Pandavas to win, as well, which is why Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu, one of the three main Hindu gods)\nsides with the Pandavas.\nLaws:\nThe concept of law plays an important role in the epic. In religious terms, Dharma is both the name of one\nof the Hindu gods and a concept that means a range of things, including justice, right action, and doing what you\nmust do regardless of the circumstances. The characters in the story speak about either following dharma (Law) or\ncommitting an Unlaw (the opposite of dharma), which can put the soul in jeopardy. Obeying your parents and even\nyour elder siblings is part of the law.\n478 The Mahabharata\nOther laws involve family rights. Since the status of a woman in a family depended on her ability to bear chil-\ndren, a wife whose husband was unable to give her children had the right to demand that one of his brothers be the\nfather of her children. When one of the kings in the epic (Vicitravirya) is unable to father children, his wives insist\nthat either his half-brother (Bhisma) or his step-brother (Vyasa) give them children. Vyasa, the king\u2019s brother by\nmarriage only, becomes the father of the king\u2019s sons, Dhritarashtra and Pandu.\nBlood ties, therefore, are less important in the epic than how society chooses to recognize you. By law, children\nfrom a previous marriage (or born illegitimately) become the legal children of the man that their mother marries.\nIf a husband accepts a child as his own, even if the father of the child is another man, society recognizes that child\nas his. When Pandu is unable to have children (for unusual reasons), he asks his wife to say a prayer she knows that\nwill call down various Hindu gods to father his children, and she shares the prayer with his second wife. The sons of\nPandu are not his actual blood sons, but rather are accepted as his sons by law.\nSons of pandu:\n\u2022 Yudhishthira is the eldest. He is the son of Kunti (the first wife) and Dharma, god of justice.\n\u2022 Bhima is the son of Kunti and Vayu, god of the wind (considered the strongest natural force).\n\u2022 Arjuna is the son of Kunti and Indra, god of war.\n\u2022 Nakula and Sahadeva are twins. Their mother is Madri (the second wife), and their fathers are\n\u2022 The Asvins (pronounced Ashvins), twin horsemen gods.\nThey are related to Krishna through Kunti, who is his aunt, and all five brothers are married to the same wom-\nan, Draupadi (sometimes referred to as Krishn\u00e3), through a mistake in the law.\nWritten by Laura Getty\nImage 3.2: The Battle of Kurukshetra | Armies standing in a circular formation ready to attack in the Battle of Kurukshetra.\nAuthor: User \u201cYadupati\u201d\nSource: Flickr\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA\n479 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nTHE MAHABHArATA - A SynopSIS oF THE GrEAT EpIC oF InDIA\nLicense: Copyright Larry Brown\nLarry A.

Portions of the following summary have been\nadapted from David Williams, Peter Brook and the Mahabharata: Critical Perspectives, 1991.\npArT onE: THE GAME oF DICE\nIn the first two books of the Mahabharata, we learn the background of the Bharatas (also called the Kurus)\nleading up to the conflict between the five sons of Pandu and their cousins the Kauravas. This story is told by the\nsage Vyasa, whose name came to mean the \u201ccompiler.\u201d (Actually, the author of the epic is unknown, probably many\nauthors over centuries.) Vyasa\u2019s mother is Satyavati, whose name means truth, so he is the \u201cson of truth.\u201d In telling\nhis story to a descendant of the Pandavas, Vyasa says, \u201cIf you listen carefully, at the end you\u2019ll be someone else.\u201d\n(play) Vyasa appears infrequently throughout the story, giving advice and also fathering Pandu and Dhritarashtra.\nAncestors of the Pandavas and Kauravas\nSantanu, king of Hastinapura, was married to the beautiful Ganga, who was the river goddess in disguise. She\nagreed to marry him as long as he never questioned her actions. Over the years they had seven sons, but Ganga\nthrew each one into the river. Santanu was distressed but he kept his promise. Finally, when their eighth son was\nborn, Santanu asked his wife who she really was and why she had done this. Ganga revealed herself and told that\nher children had once been celestial beings, but were cursed to become human. She had ended their \u201cpunishment\u201d\nquickly by drowning them immediately at birth. But since Santanu had questioned her actions, she left him, along\nwith his last son Devarata.\nDevarata is better known by his later name Bhishma. He receives this name, which means \u201cof terrible resolve,\u201d\nafter vowing never to marry or have children. His father wanted to marry again (Satyavati, mother of Vyasa), but the\nconditions of the marriage were that the second wife would be the mother of a king someday. Honoring his father\u2019s\nwishes, Bhishma makes his vow, guaranteeing that neither he nor a son of his will challenge the claim to the throne.\nYears later, one of Bhishma\u2019s half-brothers dies in battle, and the other becomes old enough to marry. On behalf\nof his half-brother, Bhishma abducts three sisters and fights off all their suitors. On returning home, he learns that\none of the sisters, Amba, had already chosen a suitor. Bhishma allows her to leave, but her betrothed does not want\nher any more. Now abandoned, she returns to Bhishma and demands that he marry her. Ever faithful to his vow,\nBhishma refuses. Amba then vows that one day she will kill him, even though the gods have granted Bhishma the\npower to choose the day of his death, because of his vow.\nThe importance and power of vows are evident throughout the epic. Once stated, a vow becomes the truth and\nmust be fulfilled, no matter what else may happen. When his father and both his half-brothers die prematurely\n480 The Mahabharata\nwithout children, Bhishma refuses to marry his step-brother\u2019s widows (Amba\u2019s sisters). He will not relinquish his\nvow, even though his celibacy makes no difference anymore.\nThe young princesses must be given children, but who can father them? There are no other men in the family\nbesides Bhishma, and he has renounced women. So Satyavati, the king\u2019s second wife, asks her first-born son, Vyasa\nthe poet, to give children to the two princesses. He goes to them, but the princesses dislike him, for as an ascetic\nwho has taken a vow of poverty, he is filthy and smells. He explains to them that they will each bear a son: however,\nthe first will be born blind because the first princess closed her eyes when seeing him, and the second will be pale-\nskinned because the second princess became pale at his touch. The blind son is called Dhritarashtra, the pale one is\nPandu. Vyasa has a third son Vidura by a handmaiden.\nAs his brother is blind and unfit for the throne, Pandu becomes the new king of Hastinapura. One day while\nhunting in the forest, Pandu shoots a gazelle in the act of mating. The gazelle was actually a brahmin priest in\ndisguise, who curses him saying that should Pandu make love to either of his two wives (Kunti and Madri), he will\ndie instantly. Knowing he can never have children, Pandu resigns the throne, and goes to live with his wives in the\nmountains. Kunti, his first wife, informs him that she possesses a magic power. By reciting a secret formula, she\ncan invoke a god at will and have a child by him. The mantra\u2019s power is put to the test, and three sons are born to\nher: Yudhishthira, the first-born, truthful and virtuous, son of the god Dharma; Bhima, the strongest of men, son\nof Vayu, god of the wind; and Arjuna, an irresistible warrior, son of Indra. Madri, Pandu\u2019s second wife, makes use\nof this power too. She gives birth to twin sons, Nakula and Sahadeva. Thanks to his two wives, Pandu now has five\nsons directly descended from the gods, the Pandavas, the heroes of the epic.\nYears later, Pandu one day surrenders to his passion for Madri. Fearing for his life, Madri tries to push him\naway but her struggles only inflame his desire more. Once they make love, Pandu falls dead, fulfilling the curse, and\nMadri, devoted to him always, joins him on the funeral pyre.\nMeanwhile, Dhritarashtra has become king, despite his blindness. He weds Gandhari in an arranged marriage.\nWhen she learns of her husband\u2019s infirmity, she decides to cover her eyes with a blindfold which she will never\nremove, to join him in his world of darkness. Then, after an abnormally long pregnancy of two years, she gives birth\nto a ball of flesh. Vyasa tells her to split up the ball into 100 parts and put them in jars of ghee (Indian butter); in\nthis way she becomes the mother of one hundred sons, the Kauravas.\nThe first born is called Duryodhana. Sinister omens of violence greet his arrival into the world: jackals howl,\nstrong winds blow, fires rage through the city. Dhritarashtra worries about what all this means. Vidura tells him that\nhis first son brings hate and destruction into the world. He will one day destroy their race. Vidura urges the king to\nget rid of the child, but Dhritarashtra ignores his advice.\nDhritarashtra is a weak ruler. He allows physical blindness to become a refusal to face reality and unwillingness\nto confront hard decisions, being easily led by Duryodhana in later years. He continually blames fate, excusing his\nown inaction: \u201cIrrevocable were all the things that have happened. Who could have stopped them? What then can I\ndo? Destiny is surely all-powerful\u201d (KD 69). But one of Dhritarashtra\u2019s advisors tells him: \u201cO king, surely a man who\nmeets with calamity as a result of his own acts should not blame the gods, destiny, or others. Each of us receives the\njust results of our actions\u201d (KD 538).\nGrowing rivalry between the pandavas and the Kauravas\nBhishma, now an old man, takes the responsibility of raising the two sets of cousins. They fight constantly, and\neven try to kill each other. One day a teacher and master of arms, Drona, appears and offers his services to train\nthe boys. He has a secret mission: to avenge an insult made by a former friend. When young, Drona was close to\nDrupada, but years later, when Drona went to see his childhood companion, now a great king, he was scorned by\nDrupada because \u201conly equals can be friends.\u201d As payment for his training, Drona asks the Pandavas to avenge him.\nBeing mighty warriors, they conquer Drupada\u2019s kingdom, and hand it over to Drona. He promptly gives his former\nfriend half his kingdom back, saying \u201cnow we are equals.\u201d\n\u2022 For revenge, Drupada has children by sorcery, born out of flames: son Dhrishtadyumna is fated to kill\nDrona; an oracle says daughter Draupadi will \u201cbring destruction on an unrighteous ruler;\u201d a third child\nSikhandi is Amba reborn.\n\u2022 Later in the war, Drona and Bhishma will fight on the side of the Kauravas not so much out of loyalty but\nbecause their mortal enemies (Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandi) fight with the Pandavas.\nDrona recognizes Arjuna\u2019s superiority as a master of arms, especially the bow, and favors him with special\ntraining. In a contest of skill, he tells each of the Pandavas to strike a target, the eye of a wooden bird in a tree. He\nasks each one in turn, \u201cO prince, tell me what you see.\u201d One by one they respond, \u201cI see my teacher, my brothers,\n481 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthe tree and the bird.\u201d Drona tells them, \u201cThen you will not hit the mark.\u201d Arjuna, however, says he sees only the\nbird, and in fact, only the eye of the bird. Thus, focused on his target alone, he strikes with total accuracy. Drona\nrewards Arjuna by giving him a supreme weapon, the Brahmasira, only to be used against celestial beings, or else it\nwill destroy the world.\nDrona stages a tournament to display all the Pandavas\u2019 skills, but a stranger appears who challenges Arjuna and\nequals him in archery. This is Karna, who the reader learns is Kunti\u2019s first son by Surya the sun god, whom she bore\nbefore she married Pandu and abandoned in a basket on the river (like Moses). Thus Karna is the older brother of\nthe Pandavas. However, Karna does not know his real mother, being raised by a chariot driver. The Pandavas mock\nhis lowly social status and will not fight with someone who is not of royal birth, but their cousin Duryodhana sees\nthe chance to make an ally. Ignoring the strict rules of caste, he says, \u201cBirth is obscure and men are like rivers whose\norigins are often unknown\u201d (play). Duryodhana gives Karna a small kingdom, and Karna swears eternal friendship\nto the Kauravas.\n\u2022 Karna\u2019s lowly caste (social status) will haunt him throughout the epic; later at a contest for the hand of\nDraupadi, she rejects him outright because he is from a servant family. For a person who desires to be mea-\nsured by his accomplishments, living under this shadow is unbearable.\n\u2022 As the child of the sun, Karna was born with golden armor over his skin. Later, the god Indra tricks Karna\ninto giving this divine protection away.\n\u2022 After Karna was born, Kunti remained a virgin\nThe Pandavas narrowly escape a plot by Duryodhana to burn them in a house made of highly flammable ma-\nterials. For months afterward, they live in hiding in the forest. One night as Bhima keeps watch while the others\nsleep, there appears a rakshasa named Hidimbi (a man-eating ogre, one type of demon). Assuming the form of a\nbeautiful woman, she falls madly in love with Bhima, who fights and kills her venomous brother. Bhima and the\nmagical creature then have a powerful demon child called Ghatotkatcha; he swears to come to the aid of his father\nwhenever necessary.\nArjuna wins the hand of Draupadi\nThe Pandavas attend the swayamvara of Draupadi, a ceremony where she will pick her husband from a number\nof suitors. Arjuna wins the archery contest easily and Draupadi chooses him. When Arjuna announces to his mother\nthat he has won the \u201cprize,\u201d Kunti tells him to share with his brothers, before seeing Draupadi. Like an irrevocable\nvow, her statement, even by mistake, can\u2019t be undone, so all five brothers marry Draupadi, the daughter of Drupada.\nThis unusual marriage fulfills karma, for in her former life, Draupadi had prayed to the god Shiva for a husband\nfive times, and thus is rewarded for her devotion in this life.\nIn the Mahabharata Shiva is not the \u201cdestroyer\u201d of the later Puranas, but has more to do with blessings of fertili-\nty: he also granted Gandhari her 100 sons.\nThe brothers agree to respect the privacy of each other when with Draupadi, but one day Arjuna enters the tent\nto retrieve his weapons and finds Yudhishthira and Draupadi in bed together. Even though Yudhishthira forgives\nhim, Arjuna insists on keeping the vow. As penance, Arjuna goes into exile for a year; while away he marries three\nother wives, one Krishna\u2019s sister, mostly for political alliances.\nAs tension mounts between the cousins, Krishna makes his appearance. It is said he may be an incarnation of\nthe god Vishnu, the preserver, come down to save the earth from chaos. The appearance of Krishna introduces a\nmajor theme in the epic: dharma (cosmic order) menaced by chaos, so Krishna must step in, indicating that this is\nnot just a family rivalry, but a conflict with universal consequences.\n\u2022 In the medieval Puranas, the story developed that Vishnu had appeared on earth nine times in the past as\nan avatar or incarnation, in order to set the world back on the right path, and would appear again at the\nend of the age.\n\u2022 Krishna\u2019s deification in the Mahabharata may be based on later interpolations into the text, as there is con-\nsiderable tension in the epic between the depiction of the divine Krishna and the human prince who acts as\ncounselor to the Pandavas, gives devious advice, and eventually dies.\nOn Krishna\u2019s advice the Pandavas present themselves to the blind king. To make peace, Dhritarashtra offers\nthem half the kingdom, but in a region which was nothing but jungle and desert. Yudhishthira accepts his offer in\nthe hope of averting a war.\n482 The Mahabharata\nMeanwhile, Arjuna and Krishna agree to assist a hungry brahmin, who reveals himself to be Agni, god of fire.\nHe wants to consume a nearby forest which is protected by Indra\u2019s rain. Agni rewards Krishna with his discus and\nArjuna with Varuna\u2019s bow Gandiva along with an inexhaustible supply of arrows. With these he is able to create a\ncanopy of arrows to keep the rain from putting out Agni\u2019s fire. Even Indra cannot defeat Arjuna, because Krishna is\nwith him (an indication of Vishnu\u2019s superiority over Indra by this time). Maya (not god of illusion but an asura or\ndemon who escaped the fires) out of gratitude builds the great hall of Indraprastha.\nLiving in their new territory of Indraprastha, Yudhishthira turns poor land into a wealthy kingdom, and de-\nclares himself King of Kings. Duryodhana is jealous and humiliated on his visit to the magnificent palace, where he\nmistakes a glass floor for a pool, then later falls into a pool thinking it is glass. Draupadi and Bhima laugh at him.\nHe returns home bent on devising their destruction.\nThe Dice Game and the Humiliation of Draupadi\nDuryodhana follows the advice of his uncle, the cunning Shakuni, an infamous dice player, and invites Yud-\nhishthira to a game, knowing full well that gambling is his cousin\u2019s one weakness. Yudhishthira accepts.\n\u2022 Duryodhana is not an original thinker, always relying on other\u2019s ideas. His uncle gave him the idea for the\narson and the dice game. (Later during the war Duryodhana suggests capturing Yudhishthira and playing\nanother game, which Drona calls stupid.)\n\u2022 Duryodhana always threatens to commit suicide when things don\u2019t go his way (almost comical): \u201cExcessive\nself-centeredness leads to unrealistic demands and unreasonable expectations from life\u201d (Chaitanya 67).\n\u2022 Kunti: \u201cDuryodhana is a blind man\u2019s son, living blindly.\u201d (play)\nBoth Dhritarashtra and Yudhishthira ignore Vidura\u2019s warning to avoid the game, leaving the results to \u201csupreme\nand unavoidable\u201d fate. Krishna warns Bhishma not to interfere with the dice game: \u201cIf your race must be destroyed\nto save dharma, would you allow it?\u201d (play) Told by his father that a warrior\u2019s dharma is to fight honorably, not to\nwin at all costs, Duryodhana says, \u201cThe way of the warrior is fixed on victory, whether there\u2019s dharma or adharma\non his way.\u201d\nCarried away by the intoxication of the game, Yudhishthira wagers and loses all that he possesses: his lands, his\nkingdom, his brothers, even himself, and eventually Draupadi, who is dragged before the company by her hair, a\nspecial insult since a married woman\u2019s hair was sacred.\nShe challenges the Kauravas with a question: how can someone who has lost himself wager someone else in a\ngame, but no one can answer her. Even Bhishma is confounded: \u201cThe ways of dharma are subtle.\u201d When even the\nwise Bhishma cannot resolve the question, she says, \u201cI think time is out of joint. The ancient eternal dharma is lost\namong the Kauravas.\u201d Instead, they insult her, displaying her during the time of her period. Karna, still stinging\nfrom his rejection at the swayamvara, calls her a harlot who services five men. Duryodhana seeks to entice her by\nuncovering his thigh (obscene in that culture). Enraged at this treatment of his wife, Bhima vows that he will one\nday drink Duhsasana\u2019s blood and break Duryodhana\u2019s thigh.\nDraupadi is about to be stripped naked when she invokes Krishna, who comes to her rescue and creates an\nendless supply of cloth around her. She swears that one day she will be avenged. There will be a great war, a war\nwithout mercy. At her curse a jackal howls. Frightened, Dhritarashtra apologizes to her and gives her husbands\u2019\nback everything they lost, but Draupadi asks nothing for herself, saying, \u201cGreed devours all beings and is dharma\u2019s\n[righteousness] ruin. I refuse greed.\u201d (CN 55)\nSeeing his advantage given away, Duryodhana insists on one more throw of the dice. Yudhishthira agrees to a\nfinal game, but once again, he loses. The Pandavas and Draupadi are condemned to spend twelve years in exile in\nthe forest, and a thirteenth year in an unknown place, disguised so that no one may recognize them. If anyone does,\nthen they must spend another twelve years in exile.\npArT Two: ExILE\nBooks 3-5 tell of the twelve years of living in the forest, preceding the great war. The Pandavas are not alone in\nthe wilderness but are followed by many loyal brahmins and servants. The gods give them an inexhaustible plate of\nfood to feed all of them.\nThroughout the epic, the importance of brahmins, the priestly caste, is emphasized. Yudhishthira wants to\nregain his kingdom so that he can provide for 10,000 brahmins. One must never refuse a brahmin anything\n483 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThe Importance of Dharma\nDraupadi and Bhima reproach Yudhishthira for his inaction and resigned passivity. Since it is obvious that\nShakuni cheated at dice, wouldn\u2019t it be better to stand up and fight? Yudhishthira flatly refuses. He will keep his\nword: he resolves to follow his dharma. Dharma (variously translated as social duty, righteousness, or universal or-\nder) is the moral obligation which each human being should recognize and follow. Failure to do so could endanger\nthe course of the cosmos as a whole.\nDraupadi cannot understand why they are suffering so, if they are the righteous ones. If everything happens by\nthe will of god, then why do the good suffer? It seems only the powerful escape harm, not the righteous. Yudhishthira\ncorrects her: \u201cNone should ever perform virtue with a desire to gain its fruits. Such a sinful trader of virtue will never\nreap the results. ... Do not doubt virtue because you do not see its results. Without doubt, the fruits of virtue will be\nmanifest in time, as will the fruits of sin. The fruits of true virtue are eternal and indestructible\u201d (KD 245-6).\npreparations for war\nArjuna then leaves, aiming for the highest mountains to look for the celestial weapons they will need during\nthe war. He meets the god Shiva who gives him powerful weapons. Arjuna then spends five years with his father the\ndivine Indra learning to use the weapons fighting demons.\nMeanwhile Karna decides he too must acquire a celestial weapon, so for many months he serves a powerful\nbrahmin, Parasurama, who hates warriors. As a reward, he bestows upon Karna, whom he takes to be a servant, a\nformula for the supreme weapon. But Karna reveals himself to be a warrior by an excess of bravery, as he does not\ncry out when a worm bores a hole into his thigh. Parasurama curses him so he will forget the secret formula at the\nmoment he wishes for the weapon, and that will be the moment of his death.\n\u2022 In the Medieval Puranas, Parasurama becomes one of the avatars of Vishnu, but there is no indication of\nthat aspect in the epic.\nKarna later meets Indra (Arjuna\u2019s divine father) in the disguise of a brahmin. Having sworn never to refuse a\nbrahmin\u2019s request, he agrees to surrender his divine covering of golden armor given him at birth. He tears off the\narmor from his skin, bleeding, and trades it for another mighty weapon, which will kill any being but can only be\nused once.\nDuring their exile, the Pandavas rescue Duryodhana who is captured during battle, to his great humiliation.\nHonor bids him swear to repay Arjuna one day. (During the war, Arjuna asks Duryodhana to surrender five arrows\nof Bhishma\u2019s meant to kill the Pandavas, and he does so, to keep his vow.) Duryodhana is so depressed after his\nrescue that he intends to kill himself. The Danavas (a family of demons) need him as their champion (he was born\nat their request) and appear before him. The demons promise they will possess his armies during the coming war,\nwhich will continue to give him false hope.\nOne day, four of the Pandavas are killed by drinking the water from a poisonous lake. However Yudhishthira\nbrings his brothers back to life by correctly answering the questions which Dharma, disguised as a crane, puts to him.\nThe Thirteenth year\nAccording to the conditions of the game of dice, the thirteenth year which the Pandavas are to spend in dis-\nguise has now arrived. Yudhishthira (who presents himself as a poor brahmin), his brothers and Draupadi (who\npass for wandering servants) all find refuge at the court of King Virata. Kicaka, a general in Virata\u2019s court becomes\ninfatuated with Draupadi. He goes to great lengths to possess her, even threatening her life. Draupadi implores the\nmighty Bhima to help her; dressed in woman\u2019s clothes, he goes in her stead to a secret rendezvous, and pulverizes\nthe over-amorous general into a bloody mass of flesh.\nMeanwhile Duryodhana has launched an attack on Virata\u2019s kingdom. The king entrusts his troops to his young\nson who needs a chariot driver. Draupadi, who seeks war with the Kauravas at all costs, points out Arjuna as the\nworld\u2019s best charioteer, despite the fact that he has disguised himself as a eunuch. Arjuna cannot refuse to fight and\nis decisively victorious, one man against countless armies.\nWar draws even closer. Duryodhana refuses to give his cousins back their kingdom because he claims they\ncame out of hiding before the appointed time. He tries to win Krishna\u2019s support, as does Arjuna. Krishna offers Ar-\njuna first choice: either he can have all of Krishna\u2019s armies, or he can have Krishna alone. Arjuna chooses Krishna,\nallowing Duryodhana to have the armies. When Arjuna asks him to drive his chariot, Krishna accepts.\nIn the Kaurava court, the blind king also senses the imminence of war. He asks the elderly Bhishma, an unpar-\nalleled warrior, to take the supreme command. His duty to the family outweighs his feelings toward the Pandavas,\n484 The Mahabharata\nand he reluctantly accepts, but on one condition: that Karna does not fight. Although displeased, Karna bitterly\nagrees to fight only after Bhishma\u2019s death.\nDhritarashtra sends an envoy to Yudhishthira and begs not to fight since he loves righteousness. It would be\nbetter to live without his kingdom than risk the lives of so many. Yudhishthira responds that each caste has its own\nduty, and his is to be a warrior\/king, not a brahmin\/beggar. However, even he has reservations: \u201cWar is evil in any\nform. To the dead, victory and defeat are the same\u201d (CN 101).\nKrishna arrives as an emissary in a final attempt to safeguard peace. He speaks to Duryodhana who does not\nlisten to him, but orders his guards to seize him. Krishna reveals his divine form: \u201cKrishna laughed and as he did,\nhis body suddenly flashed like lightning. He began to grow in size and various gods issued from him. Brahma\nsprang from his forehead and Shiva from his chest\u201d (KD 492). Krishna allows even the blind Dhritarashtra to see\nhis glory. Finally, he speaks to Karna, going so far as to reveal that he is the brother of those with whom he intends\nto fight. But Karna feels abandoned by his mother in his very first hours of life; furthermore he senses the end of\nthis world. He will fight alongside the Kauravas, even though he can already foresee their defeat and his own death.\nDuryodhana will not listen to warnings. He convinces himself that since the gods had not blessed the Pandavas\nthus far, they would not protect them during the war. \u201cI can sacrifice my life, my wealth, my kingdom, my everything,\nbut I can never live in peace with the Pandavas. I will not surrender to them even as much land as can be pierced by\nthe point of a needle\u201d (KD 453). He makes excuses for his nature: \u201cI am whatever the gods have made me\u201d (KD 482).\npArT THrEE: THE wAr\nBooks 5-10 recount the 18-day war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas.\nThe Kauravas have eleven divisions to stand against the seven of the Pandavas. The two armies are described\nas two oceans, crashing against each other. Briefly it\u2019s described as a \u201cbeautiful sight\u201d (CN 125-6). Kunti tells the\nnarrator Vyasa (in play): \u201cYou find too much beauty in men\u2019s death. Blood decorates your poem, and the cries of the\ndying are your music.\u201d\nBad omens appear prior to battle as thousands of carrion birds gather \u201ccrying in glee\u201d (KD 539). Karna prophe-\nsies that his side will lose, that this is nothing but \u201ca great sacrifice of arms\u201d with Krishna as high priest.\nBoth sides agree to abide by certain rules of war: no fighting humans with celestial weapons, no fighting at night,\ndo not strike someone who\u2019s retreating or unarmed, or on the back or legs. All these rules will eventually be broken.\nThe Bhagavad Gita (\u201cThe Lord\u2019s Song\u201d)\nJust as the battle is about to start, Arjuna falters at the sight of his relatives and teachers, now his sworn enemies.\nHe breaks down and refuses to fight.\nHow can any good come from killing one\u2019s own relatives? What value is victory if all our friends and loved\nones are killed? \u2026 We will be overcome by sin if we slay such aggressors. Our proper duty is surely to\nforgive them. Even if they have lost sight of dharma due to greed, we ourselves should not forget dharma in\nthe same way. (KD 544-5)\nArjuna fears that acting out his own dharma as warrior will conflict with universal dharma: how can killing family\nmembers be good, and not disrupt the social order? Herein lies an unresolved conflict in Hinduism between universal\ndharma and svadharma (an individual\u2019s duty according to caste and station in life). A warrior must kill to fulfill his\nduty, whereas a brahmin must avoid harming any living creature. Even demons have their own castes and svadharma,\nwhich may run counter to human morality. One person\u2019s dharma may be another\u2019s sin. This doctrine distinguishes\nHindu thought from religions such as Judeo-Christianity and Islam which teach universal or absolute moral codes.\nHis charioteer Krishna addresses him as they pause in the no-man\u2019s land between the two armies. This passage\nis the celebrated Bhagavad Gita, the guide to firm and resolute action.\n\u2022 Unlike many epic heroes, at this point Arjuna thinks before he acts. Arjuna hesitates before such killing,\nwanting to retreat from life and responsibility (tension between dharma and moksha), but Krishna tells him\nas a warrior it\u2019s his dharma to fight. The real conflict today is with the self on the \u201cbattlefield of the soul.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t worry about death, which is only one small step in the great and endless cycle of life. One neither\nkills or is killed. The soul merely casts off old bodies and enters new ones, just as a person changes gar-\nments. Death is only illusion (maya).\n\u2022 How does a warrior perform his duty without doing wrong, polluting himself with the blood of his ene-\nmies? The secret is detachment: do your duty without concern for the personal consequences. \u201cVictory and\ndefeat, pleasure and pain are all the same. Act, but don\u2019t reflect on the fruits of the act. Forget desire, seek\ndetachment.\u201d (play)\n485 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u2022 We must always do what is right without desiring success or fearing defeat. \u201cWork without desire for the\nresults, and thus without entangling yourself in karmic reactions\u201d (KD 550). Krishna tells Arjuna that good\ndeeds will not get one to heaven if the desire for heaven is the sole motivation for good deeds. Desire is\nresponsible for rebirth; if any desire remains when we die, we must return to another life.\n\u2022 Likewise, Yudhishthira told Draupadi during the exile that he performs dharma not for reward but because\nit is what a good person does; after the battle he has a similar crisis when he temporarily refuses to rule,\ndespairing at all the carnage he has caused.\n\u2022 \u201cActions performed under the direct guidance of the Supreme Lord or His representative are called akarma.\nThis type of activity produces neither good nor bad reactions. Just as a soldier may kill under the command\nof his superior officer and not be held responsible for murder, though if he kills on his own accord he is\nliable for punishment, similarly, a Krishna-conscious person acts under the Lord\u2019s direction and not for his\nown sake\u201d (BG as it is: online).\n\u2022 \u201cSuch a person takes no delight in sensual pleasures. He is ever satisfied within himself. No miseries can\ndisturb him, nor any kind of material happiness. He is without attachment, fear and anger, and remains\nalways aloof to the dualities of the world. \u2026 His mind is fixed upon the Supreme and he is always peaceful\u201d\n(KD 551).\n\u2022 There are two paths to liberation: renunciation (moksha) and performing one\u2019s duty without desire. Since\nno one can truly renounce all action in life (this is a pretense of asceticism), it is better to work without at-\ntachment (KD 551). Some scholars think that the Bhagavad Gita was composed to combat a religious chal-\nlenge from Jainism and Buddhism which arose in the sixth century BC, both teaching salvation through\nrenouncing the world, the former by asceticism, the latter by monastic life (Kinsley 31).\n\u2022 Krishna explains that the knowledge he imparts is ancient, just as he told it millions of years ago. Arjuna\nasks, \u201cHow can I accept this? It appears that you were born in this world only recently.\u201d Krishna explains,\nbirth too is an illusion, as men are born countless times. But in Krishna\u2019s case, he comes into every age:\n\u201cWhenever righteousness (dharma) becomes lax, O Arjuna, and injustice (adharma) arises, then I send\nmyself forth to protect the good and bring evildoers to destruction. For the secure establishment of dhar-\nma, I come into being age after age. ... I was born to destroy the destroyers.\u201d\n\u2022 Krishna then reveals his divine, universal nature to Arjuna in a magnificent vision of a multitude of gods,\nstretching out to infinity. Resolved now to perform his duty to his lord, Arjuna leads his troops into battle.\nOn a hill overlooking the battlefield, Dhritarashtra hears the words of Krishna through his aid Sanjaya, who\nhas been granted the ability to see and hear everything that happens in the battle, to relate these things to the blind\nking. Dhritarashtra shudders when he hears of Krishna\u2019s theophany, fearing that nothing can stop the Pandavas\nwith such a powerful being on their side. But he takes some comfort in knowing that Krishna cannot accomplish\neverything he wants, as he failed to arrange a peaceful solution to the conflict.\nBefore the battle, Yudhishthira goes to both his teachers, Bhishma and Drona: \u201cO invincible one, I bow to you.\nWe will fight with you. Please grant us your permission and give us your blessing.\u201d For this sign of respect, both\nmen pray for the Pandavas\u2019 victory, even though they must out of loyalty fight on the side of the Kauravas.\nThe Battle Begins\nBhishma compares the invincible Arjuna to \u201cthe Destroyer himself at the end of the Yuga.\u201d (CN 126) In one\nconfrontation, Arjuna splits Bhishma\u2019s bow with four arrows, and Bhishma praises him: \u201cO son of Pandu, well\ndone! I am pleased with you for this wonderful feat. Now fight your hardest with me\u201d (KD 581). However, he is\nunable to overcome Bhishma. After nine days of fighting, the Pandavas visit Bhishma by night; they tell him that,\nunless he is killed in the war, the carnage will carry on until the end of the world.\nWhen asked how he can be defeated, he advises them to place Sikhandi in the front line, from where he will be\nable to fire freely at Bhishma. Sikhandi is actually a woman, Amba whom Bhishma had refused to marry and who\nvowed to be his death. Amba practiced asceticism, standing on one toe in the snow for twelve years to learn the se-\ncret of Bhishma\u2019s death. Amba threw herself into the fire and was reborn from flames as Drupada\u2019s second daughter,\nlater changing sex with a demon to become a man\nThe next day, confronted by Sikhandi, Bhishma refuses to fight a woman, and he abandons his weapons.\nAgainst the rules of war, the Pandavas strike the unarmed warrior with thousands of arrows. There is no space\n486 The Mahabharata\non his body thicker than two fingers that is not pierced. He falls from his chariot, and lies fully supported by the\narrows, with no part of his body touching the earth. Bhishma does not actually die until much later, at his choosing.\nHe remains lying on a bed of arrows until the end of the battle.\nDrona takes command\nDrona positions the armies in a formation known only to him, the iron disc of war, which nobody knows how\nto break open, apart from Arjuna. If only Arjuna can be diverted away from the central battle, Drona promises vic-\ntory. Arjuna has a fifteen-year old son, Abhimanyu, who, by listening to his father while still in his mother\u2019s womb,\nhas learned to force an entry into Drona\u2019s battle formation. As Arjuna is called to a diversionary battle far away,\nYudhishthira entrusts Abhimanyu with the task of opening a breach in the disc. Abhimanyu succeeds, but when\nBhima and Yudhishthira try to follow him into the opening, they are stopped by Jayadratha, a brother-in-law to the\nKauravas, and the breach closes behind the young Abhimanyu. In spite of his bravery, he is killed.\n\u2022 Earlier during the time of exile, Jayadratha had tried to kidnap Draupadi, thus another reason for the Pan-\ndavas to hate him.\nAt this point Arjuna returns to the camp. Inflamed with rage and grief at the sight of his son\u2019s body, he vows\nto kill Jayadratha before sunset on the following day. He solemnly swears to throw himself into the sacrificial fire,\nshould he fail. Even Krishna is alarmed by this terrible oath. On the next day, Jayadratha is heavily guarded, and Ar-\njuna is unable to reach him. Krishna causes a momentary eclipse of the sun, convincing the enemy that, since night\nhas come, Arjuna must have killed himself because he hasn\u2019t kept his vow. Rejoicing, they lay down their arms,\nleaving Jayadratha vulnerable to Arjuna\u2019s arrow.\nJayadratha\u2019s father had pronounced a curse on anyone who killed his son, saying that whoever caused his son\u2019s\nhead to fall to the ground would die. Using magical mantras, Arjuna causes his arrow not only to sever Jayadratha\u2019s\nhead, but to carry it miles away to fall into his father\u2019s lap. Being in prayer, he doesn\u2019t realize what\u2019s happened; he\nstands up and the head falls, thus he dies from his own curse.\nThe following day, Karna hurls himself into the battle. Kunti tries to persuade him to join the Pandavas, but\nKarna is inflexible. However, he does promise Kunti that he will only kill Arjuna, for one of them must die. In this\nway, she will still have five sons after the war.\nKarna possesses a magic lance, the gift of Indra, which will kill any living being but can be used only once. He\nkeeps it in reserve for Arjuna. To dispose of this lance, Krishna calls upon Ghatotkatcha, son of Bhima and the rak-\nshasa. During the night, he fights an epic battle against Karna, who can destroy the demon only by resorting to his\nmagic lance. Ghatotkatcha is killed, but Krishna dances for joy. With his lance now expended, Karna is vulnerable\nand Arjuna can kill him.\nDrona continues to challenge the Pandava armies, slaying thousands. But the Pandavas know his weakness: the\nlove of his only son Ashvatthama. Bhima slays an elephant, also called Ashvatthama, then deceitfully tells Drona\nof the death of his son. Suspecting a lie, Drona asks Yudhishthira for the truth: is his son dead or not? Drona will\nlay down his arms the day an honest man lies. Krishna tells Yudhishthira: \u201cUnder such circumstances, falsehood is\npreferable to truth. By telling a lie to save a life, one is not touched by sin\u201d (CN 157). Yudhishthira speaks a half-lie,\n\u201cAshvatthama \u2013 (and muttering under his breath) the elephant \u2013 is dead.\u201d Before his lie, Yudhishthira\u2019s chariot rode\nfour inches off the ground, but now it sinks back to earth. Drona lays down his arms. Drupada\u2019s son Dhrishtadyum-\nna cuts off Drona\u2019s head, having sworn to avenge his father\u2019s humiliation.\nMeanwhile Bhima sees Duhsasana coming towards him. Bhima had sworn to drink the blood of this avowed\nenemy for what he had done to Draupadi. Bhima knocks Duhsasana to the ground with his mace and rips open\nhis chest. He drinks his blood, saying that it tastes better than his mother\u2019s milk. Bhima, who kills many Rakshasa\n(and has a son by one), often acts like the man-eating ogres himself\u2014the bloody deaths of Kicaka and Duhsasana,\nboth to avenge Draupadi; Bhima is her most passionate defender. Bhima kills most of the 100 Kauravas, who were\ndemons incarnate.\nThe Death of Karna\nDuryodhana asks Karna to avenge his brother Duhsasana, and he finally meets Arjuna in the decisive con-\nfrontation.\nArjuna and Karna both have celestial weapons (for example, one shoots arrows of fire to be quenched by arrows\nof water). Karna has an arrow possessed by a Naga (serpent) spirit who holds a grudge against Arjuna (his family\nhad died in the forest consumed by Agni). When Karna shoots at Arjuna, his charioteer warns him that his aim is\ntoo high, but he refuses to listen, and hits Arjuna\u2019s coronet only. When the spirit-possessed arrow returns to him\n487 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nand says try again, this time he will not miss, Karna won\u2019t admit failure by shooting the same arrow twice, even if he\ncould kill 100 Arjunas.\nAs the fight continues, the earth opens up and seizes Karna\u2019s chariot wheel, in fulfillment of a curse. In des-\nperation, Karna tries to invoke his ultimate weapon, but the magic words escape him. He remembers Parasurama\u2019s\nwords: \u201cWhen you life depends on your most powerful weapon, you will not be able to summon it.\u201d In his last\nmoments, Karna questions his beliefs: \u201cKnowers of dharma have always said, \u2018Dharma protects those devoted to\ndharma.\u2019 But since my wheel sank today, I think dharma does not always protect\u201d (CN 165).\nAs he struggles to release his chariot, he cries out to Arjuna: \u201cDo not strike an unarmed man. Wait until I\ncan extract my wheel. You are a virtuous warrior. Remember the codes of war.\u201d But Krishna taunts him: \u201cMen in\ndistress always call on virtue, forgetting their own evil deeds. Where was your virtue, O Karna, when Draupadi was\nbrought weeping in the Kuru assembly? Where was it when Yudhishthira was robbed of his kingdom?\u201d (KD 780)\nKarna\u2019s head sinks to his chest, and he remains silent, while continuing to struggle with the chariot wheel. Krishna\ncommands Arjuna to shoot, and Karna dies. A bright light rises out of Karna\u2019s body and enters the sun.\n\u2022 Stubborn but loyal, Karna could have been king, as eldest of the Pandavas, but he remained with the Kau-\nravas. He always fights fair, and keeps his promise to Kunti not to kill any brothers but Arjuna. Their rivalry\nechoes the mythic conflict between their divine fathers Indra and Surya.\nThe Death of Duryodhana\nOver the eighteen-day war, Duryodhana has seen his generals and their armies fall to the Pandavas, but to the\nvery end he refuses to surrender. He hides in the waters of a lake, which he has solidified over him by magic. Ever\nthe gambler, Yudhishthira tells Duryodhana that he can fight any brother he chooses, and if he wins, the kingdom\nwill be his again. It says something of Duryodhana that he fights with Bhima rather than one of the weaker broth-\ners. In a close battle between equals, Bhima wins only by treacherously striking Duryodhana on the legs, forbidden\nin the rules of war. Gandhari had put a protective spell over Duryodhana\u2019s body, but because he wore a loin cloth\nfor modesty before his mother, his thighs were not protected.\nDuryodhana accuses Krishna of taking sides unfairly and encouraging Bhima\u2019s treachery. Krishna responds:\n\u201cDeceit in battle is acceptable against a deceitful foe. Even Indra used deceit to overcome the mighty asuras Viro-\nchana and Vritra.\u201d An onlooker remarks, \u201cBhima has sacrificed dharma for the sake of material gain. This can never\nlead to success and happiness.\u201d Krishna replies that Bhima was merely keeping his earlier vow, a sacred duty: \u201cThere\nis no unrighteousness in Bhima. He has carried out his promise and requited the debt he owed his enemy. Know\nthat the terrible age of Kali is at hand, marked by fierce acts and the loss of dharma\u201d (KD 811-13).\nDuryodhana responds bravely: \u201cI am now dying a glorious death. That end which is always sought by virtuous\nwarriors is mine. Who is as fortunate as me? With all my brothers I will ascend to heaven, while you Pandavas will\nremain here, torn by grief and continuing to suffer\u201d (KD 816).\nAs Duryodhana lies dying, Ashvatthama, Drona\u2019s son, tells him how he sneaked into the camp of the victorious\nPandavas at night to perpetrate a hideous massacre, killing the remaining warriors and all the children while asleep,\nleaving the Pandavas without any heirs. Rather than welcoming the news, Duryodhana dies disheartened that the\nrace of the Kurus appears to have no future.\nThus all those on both sides die in the war, except the five Pandavas. When Yudhishthira learns of the massacre,\nhe mourns: \u201cWe the conquerors have been conquered.\u201d\nWhen the Pandavas seek revenge, Ashvatthama launches the most fearsome celestial weapon in his arsenal.\nArjuna counters with his own weapon, which Drona taught both of them; it was only to be used against divine be-\nings, or else it could destroy the world. Ashvatthama deflects his into the wombs of the remaining Pandava women,\nmaking them sterile, but Krishna promises that Arjuna will nonetheless have descendants. As punishment, Ashvat-\nthama is cursed to wander the earth in exile for 3000 years.\nThe Aftermath\nBooks 11-18 contain events following the war and teachings by Bhishma.\nAfter the war, when Krishna exits the chariot, it bursts into flames; only his presence kept the celestial weapons\nfrom destroying it earlier. Krishna reveals that the gods allowed this war to relieve Earth of her great burden (simi-\nlar to Troy). Duryodhana was the incarnation of Kali, lord of the fourth age.\nYudhishthira reports the death toll at six million. Appalled at such losses, he has a personal crisis similar to\nArjuna before the battle. He doesn\u2019t want to rule because it requires the use of force and more violence. He sees that\nlife itself is painful, as men are always searching for more material wealth and power, never satisfied. The man who\nprizes gold and dirt equally is happiest. The others convince him he must rule and fulfill his duty.\n488 The Mahabharata\nYudhishthira has a vision of the age to come: \u201cI see the coming of another age, where barbaric kings rule over a\nvicious, broken world; where puny, fearful, hard men live tiny lives, white hair at sixteen, copulating with animals,\ntheir women perfect whores, making love with greedy mouths. The cows dry, trees stunted, no more flowers, no\nmore purity; ambition, corruption, the age of Kali, the black time\u201d (play).\nBhima asks, why has he come this far only to quit, like a man climbing a honey tree but refusing to taste it, or\na man in bed with a woman but refusing to make love? Draupadi questions his manhood, as only eunuchs seek\ntranquility and avoid violence. Arjuna says refusing to rule will only cause more disorder and create for him great\namount of bad karma to face in next life of lowly birth. We should accept our role depending on where we are in\nlife: a father has obligation to his family while they are young, likewise a king must first rule, then in the last years of\nlife he may abandon the world, but to do so earlier would be an act of selfishness.\nIn his dying speech, pierced by many arrows, Bhishma tells Yudhishthira that in the fourth age (our present\nage), \u201cdharma becomes adharma and adharma, dharma.\u201d Somewhat paradoxically, he continues, \u201cIf one fights\nagainst trickery, one should oppose him with trickery. But if one fights lawfully, one should check him with dharma\n... One should conquer evil with good. Death by dharma is better than victory by evil deeds.\u201d\nBhishma\u2019s dying advice to Yudhishthira lasts fifty days and covers two of the longest books in the epic (12-13);\nsome of the topics:\n\u2022 \u201cThere is no duty higher than Truth,\u201d but five falsehoods are not sinful: lying in jest, lying to a woman, lying\nat wedding, lying to save a teacher, lying to save one\u2019s life.\n\u2022 The foremost duty of kings is to revere Brahmins.\n\u2022 \u201cNo creature is more sinful than woman; women are the root of all evil; she is poison, she is a snake, she\nis fire,\u201d but at the same time, \u201cRighteousness of men depends on women. All pleasures and enjoyments\ndepend on women.\u201d\n\u2022 Cows constitute the stairs that lead to heaven; cows are goddesses able to grant every wish; nothing in the\nworld superior; one should never go to bed or rise in the morning without reciting the names of cows.\u201d\nCows provide cleansing from sin. \u201cThere is nothing unattainable for one who is devoted to cows\u201d (this goes\non for about fifty pages).\n\u2022 1000 names of Vishnu (twenty-six pages)\n\u2022 Shortly after, Arjuna tells Krishna that he has forgotten his teaching (contained in the Bhagavad Gita), so\nfor thirty-six chapters this advice is repeated.\nNow that all her sons are dead, Gandhari\u2019s eyes are so charged with grief that, by looking under her blindfold,\nher emotion sears the flesh of Yudhishthira\u2019s foot. She curses Krishna, whom she holds responsible for all of the\ntragedy that has befallen them: the Pandava kingdom will fall in thirty-six years. Even Krishna will die; he shall be\nkilled by a passing stranger. Krishna calmly accepts this curse, then tells her that a light has been saved, even if she\ncannot see it. Yudhishthira agrees to reign.\nDhritarashtra has one son by another wife who survives the war. Yuyutsu chose to fight on the side of the\nPandavas, deciding to follow dharma rather than loyalty to his family. After the war, out of gratitude Yudhishthira\nmakes Yuyutsu king of his old territory Indraprastha.\nThirty-six years pass, and Yudhishthira arrives at the entrance to paradise, carrying a dog in his arms. His\nbrothers and Draupadi, who left the earth with him, have fallen from the mountains into the abyss along the way. A\ngatekeeper tells him to abandon the dog if he wants to enter paradise. He refuses to leave a creature so faithful, and\nis permitted to enter, for this was a test, the dog was the god Dharma in disguise. In paradise, further surprises await\nhim. His enemies are there, smiling and contented. His brothers and Draupadi, on the other hand, seem to be in a\nplace of suffering and torment. Why? Yudhishthira decides to stay with his loved ones in hell, rather than enjoy the\ndelights of heaven with his enemies. This too was a test, the \u201cfinal illusion.\u201d They are all permitted to enter paradise.\n\u2022 In Hindu thought, neither heaven (svarga) or hell are eternal, but only intervals between rebirths. Everyone\nmust first spend some time in hell (or a hell, as there are many) to pay for the sins of the most recent life.\nYudhishthira had to experience hell for only a moment, because of his lie to Drona. Heaven is obtained by\ngood deeds, but only for a limited time until the accumulated merit runs out.\n\u2022 According to one tradition, there are six planes of existence (lokas) above earth and seven lokas (hells)\nbelow. However, no action can occur in these other worlds, so that a person\u2019s karma doesn\u2019t change until he\nreturns to earth.\n489 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u2022 \u201cActions performed in accordance with scriptural injunctions \u2026 lead the performer to the heavenly planets\nfor prolonged sensual enjoyment. However, when a person\u2019s pious credits are exhausted, he must return to\nEarth, just as a person returns from a holiday and resumes his work.\u201d (\u201cBG as it is: Online\u201d)\n[Due to the length of the Mahabharata, the summary included above, followed by selections from the work,\nprovide for a more in-depth look at the text.]\nThe Mahabharata of Krishna\nDwaipayana Vyas, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli\nBook 2\nThe Dice Game\nSection LVIII\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dThe sons of Pritha with Yudhishthira at their head, having entered that assembly house,\napproached all the kings that were present there. And worshipping all those that deserved to be worshipped, and sa-\nluting others as each deserved according to age, they seated themselves on seats that were clean and furnished with\ncostly carpets. After they had taken their seats, as also all the kings, Sakuni the son of Suvala addressed Yudhishthi-\nra and said, \u2018O king, the assembly is full. All had been waiting for thee. Let, therefore, the dice be cast and the rules\nof play be fixed, O Yudhishthira.\u2019\n\u2018Yudhishthira replied, \u2018Deceitful gambling is sinful. There is no Kshatriya prowess in it. There is certainly no\nmorality in it. Why, then, O king, dost thou praise gambling so? The wise applaud not the pride that gamesters feel\nin deceitful play. O Sakuni, vanquish us, not like a wretch, by deceitful means.\u2019\nSakuni said,\u2014\u2019That high-souled player who knoweth the secrets of winning and losing, who is skilled in baf-\nfling the deceitful arts of his confrere, who is united in all the diverse operations of which gambling consisteth, truly\nknoweth the play, and he suffereth all in course of it. O son of Pritha, it is the staking at dice, which may be lost or\nwon that may injure us. And it is for that reason that gambling is regarded as a fault. Let us, therefore, O king, begin\nthe play. Fear not. Let the stakes be fixed. Delay not!\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019That best of Munis, Devala, the son of Asita, who always instructeth us about all those\nacts that may lead to heaven, hell, or the other regions, hath said, that it is sinful to play deceitfully with a gamester.\nTo obtain victory in battle without cunning or stratagem is the best sport. Gambling, however, as a sport, is not so.\nThose that are respectable never use the language of the Mlechchas, nor do they adopt deceitfulness in their be-\nhaviour. War carried on without crookedness and cunning, this is the act of men that are honest. Do not, O Sakuni,\nplaying desperately, win of us that wealth with which according to our abilities, we strive to learn how to benefit\nthe Brahmanas. Even enemies should not be vanquished by desperate stakes in deceitful play. I do not desire either\nhappiness or wealth by means of cunning. The conduct of one that is a gamester, even if it be without deceitfulness,\nshould not be applauded.\u2019\n\u201cSakuni said,\u2014\u2019O Yudhishthira, it is from a desire of winning, which is not a very honest motive, that one high-\nborn person approacheth another (in a contest of race superiority). So also it is from a desire of defeating, which\nis not a very honest motive, that one learned person approacheth another (in a contest of learning). Such motives,\nhowever, are scarcely regarded as really dishonest. So also, O Yudhishthira, a person skilled at dice approacheth one\nthat is not so skilled from a desire of vanquishing him. One also who is conversant with the truths of science ap-\nproacheth another that is not from desire of victory, which is scarcely an honest motive. But (as I have already said)\nsuch a motive is not really dishonest. And, O Yudhishthira, so also one that is skilled in weapons approacheth one\nthat is not so skilled; the strong approacheth the weak. This is the practice in every contest. The motive is victory, O\nYudhishthira. If, therefore, thou, in approaching me, regardest me to be actuated by motives that are dishonest, if\nthou art under any fear, desist then from play.\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019Summoned, I do not withdraw. This is my established vow. And, O king, Fate is all pow-\nerful. We all are under the control of Destiny. With whom in this assembly am I to play? Who is there that can stake\nequally with me? Let the play begin.\u2019\n\u201cDuryodhana said,\u2014\u2019O monarch, I shall supply jewels and gems and every kind of wealth. And it is for me that\nthis Sakuni, my uncle, will play.\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019Gambling for one\u2019s sake by the agency of another seemeth to me to be contrary to rule.\nThou also, O learned one, will admit this. If, however, thou art still bent on it, let the play begin.\u2019\u201d\n490 The Mahabharata\nSection LIX\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dWhen the play commenced, all those kings with Dhritarashtra at their head took their\nseats in that assembly. And, O Bharata, Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and the high-souled Vidura with cheerless\nhearts sat behind. And those kings with leonine necks and endued with great energy took their seats separately\nand in pairs upon many elevated seats of beautiful make and colour. And, O king, that mansion looked resplendent\nwith those assembled kings like heaven itself with a conclave of the celestials of great good fortune. And they were\nall conversant with the Vedas and brave and of resplendent countenances. And, O great king, the friendly match at\ndice then commenced.\nYudhishthira said,\u2014\u201dO king, this excellent wealth of pearls of great value, procured from the ocean by churn-\ning it (of old), so beautiful and decked with pure gold, this, O king, is my stake. What is thy counter stake, O great\nking,--the wealth with which thou wishest to play with me?\u201d\n\u201cDuryodhana said,\u2014\u2019I have many jewels and much wealth. But I am not vain of them. Win thou this stake.\u2019\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dThen Sakuni, well-skilled at dice, took up the dice and (casting them) said unto\nYudhishthira, \u2018Lo, I have won!\u2019\u201d\nSection LX\nYudhishthira said,\u2014\u201dThou hast won this stake of me by unfair means. But be not so proud, O Sakuni. Let us play\nstaking thousands upon thousands. I have many beautiful jars each full of a thousand Nishkas in my treasury, inex-\nhaustible gold, and much silver and other minerals. This, O king, is the wealth with which I will stake with thee!\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dThus addressed, Sakuni said unto the chief of the perpetuators of the Kuru race,\nthe eldest of the sons of Pandu, king Yudhishthira, of glory incapable of sustaining any diminution. \u2018Lo, I have\nwon!\u2019\u201d\nYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019This my sacred and victorious and royal car which gladdeneth the heart and hath carried\nus hither, which is equal unto a thousand cars, which is of symmetrical proportions and covered with tiger-skin,\nand furnished with excellent wheels and flag-staffs which is handsome, and decked with strings of little bells, whose\nclatter is even like the roar of the clouds or of the ocean, and which is drawn by eight noble steeds known all over\nthe kingdom and which are white as the moon-beam and from whose hoofs no terrestrial creature can escape--this,\nO king, is my wealth with which I will stake with thee!\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dHearing these words, Sakuni ready with the dice, and adopting unfair means, said\nunto Yudhishthira, \u2018Lo, I have won!\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019I have a hundred thousand serving-girls, all young, and decked with golden bracelets on\ntheir wrists and upper arms, and with nishkas round their necks and other ornaments, adorned with costly gar-\nlands and attired in rich robes, daubed with the sandal paste, wearing jewels and gold, and well-skilled in the four\nand sixty elegant arts, especially versed in dancing and singing, and who wait upon and serve at my command the\ncelestials, the Snataka Brahmanas, and kings. With this wealth, O king, I will stake with thee!\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u2019Hearing these words, Sakuni ready with the dice, adopting unfair means, said unto\nYudhishthira. \u2018Lo, I have won!\u2019\nYudhishthira said,\u2014\u201dI have thousands of serving-men, skilled in waiting upon guests, always attired in silken\nrobes, endued with wisdom and intelligence, their senses under control though young, and decked with ear-rings,\nand who serve all guests night and day with plates and dishes in hand. With this wealth, O king, I will stake with\nthee!\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dHearing these words, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting unfair means said unto\nYudhishthira, \u2018Lo, I have won!\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019I have, O son of Suvala, one thousand musty elephants with golden girdles, decked with\nornaments, with the mark of the lotus on their temples and necks and other parts, adorned with golden garlands,\nwith fine white tusks long and thick as plough-shafts, worthy of carrying kings on their backs, capable of bearing\nevery kind of noise on the field of battle, with huge bodies, capable of battering down the walls of hostile towns, of\nthe colour of new-formed clouds, and each possessing eight she-elephants. With this wealth, O king, I will stake\nwith thee.\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dUnto Yudhishthira who had said so, Sakuni, the son of Suvala, laughingly said, \u2018Lo,\nI have won it!\u2019\nYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019I have as many cars as elephants, all furnished with golden poles and flag-staffs and well-\ntrained horses and warriors that fight wonderfully and each of whom receiveth a thousand coins as his monthly pay\nwhether he fighteth or not. With this wealth, O king, I will stake with thee!\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dWhen these words had been spoken, the wretch Sakuni, pledged to enmity, said\nunto Yudhishthira, \u2018Lo, I have won it.\u2019\n491 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nYudhishthira said.\u2014\u2019The steeds of the Tittiri, Kalmasha, and Gandharva breeds, decked with ornaments, which\nChitraratha having been vanquished in battle and subdued cheerfully gave unto Arjuna, the wielder of the Gandi-\nva. With this wealth, O king, I will stake with thee.\u201d Vaisampayana continued, \u201cHearing this, Sakuni, ready at dice,\nadopting unfair means, said unto Yudhishthira: \u2018Lo, I have won!\u2019\nYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019I have ten thousand cars and vehicles unto which are yoked draught animals of the fore-\nmost breed. And I have also sixty thousand warriors picked from each order by thousands, who are all brave and\nendued with prowess like heroes, who drink milk and eat good rice, and all of whom have broad chests. With this\nwealth, O king, I will stake with thee.\u2019\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dHearing this, Sakuni ready at dice, adopting unfair means said unto Yudhishthira,\n\u2018Lo, I have won!\u2019\nYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019I have four hundred Nidis (jewels of great value) encased in sheets of copper and iron.\nEach one of them is equal to five draunikas of the costliest and purest leaf gold of the Jatarupa kind. With this\nwealth, O king, I will stake with thee.\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dHearing this, Sakuni ready at dice, adopting foul means, said unto Yudhishthira,\n\u2018Lo, I have won it!\u2019\u201d\nSection LXI\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dDuring the course of this gambling, certain to bring about utter ruin (on Yudhishthira),\nVidura, that dispeller of all doubts, (addressing Dhritarashtra) said, \u2018O great king, O thou of the Bharata race, attend\nto what I say, although my words may not be agreeable to thee, like medicine to one that is ill and about to breathe\nhis last. When this Duryodhana of sinful mind had, immediately after his birth, cried discordantly like a jackal, it\nwas well known that he had been ordained to bring about the destruction of the Bharata race. Know, O king, that he\nwill be the cause of death of ye all. A jackal is living in thy house, O king, in the form of Duryodhana. Thou knowest\nit not in consequence of thy folly. Listen now to the words of the Poet (Sukra) which I will quote. They that collect\nhoney (in mountains), having received what they seek, do not notice that they are about to fall. Ascending dan-\ngerous heights, abstracted in the pursuit of what they seek, they fall down and meet with destruction. This Duryo-\ndhana also, maddened with the play at dice, like the collector of honey, abstracted in what he seeketh, marketh not\nthe consequences. Making enemies of these great warriors, he beholdeth not the fall that is before him. It is known\nto thee, O thou of great wisdom, that amongst the Bhojas, they abandoned, for the good of the citizens a son that\nwas unworthy of their race. The Andhakas, the Yadavas, and the Bhojas uniting together, abandoned Kansa. And\nafterwards, when at the command of the whole tribe, the same Kansa had been slain by Krishna that slayer of foes,\nall the men of the tribe became exceedingly happy for a hundred years. So at thy command, let Arjuna slay this Suy-\nodhana. And in consequence of the slaying of this wretch, let the Kurus be glad and pass their days in happiness. In\nexchange of a crow, O great king, buy these peacocks--the Pandavas; and in exchange of a jackal, buy these tigers.\nFor the sake of a family a member may be sacrificed; for the sake of a village a family may be sacrificed, for the sake\nof a province a village may be sacrificed and for the sake of one\u2019s own soul the whole earth may be sacrificed. Even\nthis was what the omniscient Kavya himself, acquainted with the thoughts of every creature, and a source of terror\nunto all foes, said unto the great Asuras to induce them to abandon Jambha at the moment of his birth. It is said\nthat a certain king, having caused a number of wild birds that vomited gold to take up their quarters in his own\nhouse, afterwards killed them from temptation. O slayer of foes, blinded by temptation and the desire of enjoyment,\nfor the sake of gold, the king destroyed at the same time both his present and future gains. Therefore, O king, pros-\necute not the Pandavas from desire of profit, even like the king in story. For then, blinded by folly thou wilt have to\nrepent afterwards, even like the person that killed the birds. Like a flower-seller that plucketh (many flowers) in the\ngarden from trees that he cherisheth with affection from day to day, continue, O Bharata, to pluck flowers day by\nday from the Pandavas. Do not scorch them to their roots like a fire-producing breeze that reduceth everything to\nblack charcoal. Go not, O king, unto the region of Yama, with thy sons and troops, for who is there that is capable\nof fighting with the sons of Pritha, together? Not to speak of others, is the chief of the celestials at the head of the\ncelestials themselves, capable of doing so?\u201d\nSection LXII\n\u201cVidura said,\u2014\u201dGambling is the root of dissensions. It bringeth about disunion. Its consequences are frightful.\nYet having recourse to this, Dhritarashtra\u2019s son Duryodhana createth for himself fierce enmity. The descendants\nof Pratipa and Santanu, with their fierce troops and their allies the Vahlikas, will, for the sins of Duryodhana meet\nwith destruction. Duryodhana, in consequence of this intoxication, forcibly driveth away luck and prosperity from\nhis kingdom, even like an infuriate bull breaking his own horns himself. That brave and learned person who dis-\nregarding his own foresight, followeth, O king, (the bent of) another man\u2019s heart, sinketh in terrible affliction even\nlike one that goeth into the sea in a boat guided by a child. Duryodhana is gambling with the son of Pandu, and\n492 The Mahabharata\nthou art in raptures that he is winning. And it is such success that begeteth war, which endeth in the destruction of\nmen. This fascination (of gambling) that thou has well-devised only leadeth to dire results. Thus hast thou simply\nbrought on by these counsels great affliction to thy heart. And this thy quarrel with Yudhishthira, who is so closely\nrelated to thee, even if thou hadst not foreseen it, is still approved by thee. Listen, ye sons of Santanu, ye descen-\ndants of Pratipa, who are now in this assembly of the Kauravas, to these words of wisdom. Enter ye not into the\nterrible fire that hath blazed forth following the wretch. When Ajatasatru, the son of Pandu, intoxicated with dice,\ngiveth way to his wrath, and Vrikodara and Arjuna and the twins (do the same), who, in that hour of confusion,\nwill prove your refuge? O great king, thou art thyself a mine of wealth. Thou canst earn (by other means) as much\nwealth as thou seekest to earn by gambling. What dost thou gain by winning from the Pandavas their vast wealth?\nWin the Pandavas themselves, who will be to thee more than all the wealth they have. We all know the skill of Su-\nvala in play. This hill-king knoweth many nefarious methods in gambling. Let Sakuni return whence he came. War\nnot, O Bharata, with the sons of Pandu!\u2019\nSection LXIII\nDuryodhana said,\u2014\u2019O Kshatta, thou art always boasting of the fame of our enemies, deprecating the sons of\nDhritarashtra. We know, O Vidura, of whom thou art really fond. Thou always disregardest us as children, That man\nstandeth confest, who wisheth for success unto those that are near to him and defeat unto those that are not his fa-\nvourites. His praise and blame are applied accordingly. Thy tongue and mind betray thy heart. But the hostility thou\nshoweth in speech is even greater than what is in thy heart. Thou hast been cherished by us like a serpent on our lap.\nLike a cat thou wishest evil unto him that cherisheth thee. The wise have said that there is no sin graver than that of\ninjuring one\u2019s master. How is it, O Kshatta, that thou dost not fear this sin? Having vanquished our enemies we have\nobtained great advantages. Use not harsh words in respect of us. Thou art always willing to make peace with the foes.\nAnd it is for this reason that thou hatest us always. A man becometh a foe by speaking words that are unpardonable.\nThen again in praising the enemy, the secrets of one\u2019s own party should not be divulged. (Thou however, transgressest\nthis rule). Therefore, O thou parasite, why dost thou obstruct us so? Thou sayest whatever thou wishest. Insult us not.\nWe know thy mind. Go and learn sitting at the feet of the old. Keen up the reputation that thou hast won. Meddle not\nwith the affairs of other men. Do not imagine that thou art our chief. Tell us not harsh words always, O Vidura. We\ndo not ask thee what is for our good. Cease, irritate not those that have already borne too much at thy hands. There is\nonly one Controller, no second. He controlleth even the child that is in the mother\u2019s womb. I am controlled by Him.\nLike water that always floweth in a downward course, I am acting precisely in the way in which He is directing me.\nHe that breaketh his head against a stone-wall, and he that feedeth a serpent, are guided in those acts of theirs by\ntheir own intellect. (Therefore, in this matter I am guided by my own intelligence). He becometh a foe who seeketh\nto control others by force. When advice, however, is offered in a friendly spirit, the learned bear with it. He again that\nhath set fire to such a highly inflammable object as camphor, beholdeth not its ashes. If he runneth immediately to\nextinguish it. One should not give shelter to another who is the friend of his foes, or to another who is ever jealous of\nhis protector or to another who is evil-minded. Therefore, O Vidura, go whither-so-ever thou pleasest. A wife that is\nunchaste, however well-treated, forsaketh her husband yet.\u2019\n\u201cVidura addressing Dhritarashtra, said, \u2018O monarch, tell us (impartially) like a witness what thou thinkest of\nthe conduct of those who abandon their serving-men thus for giving instruction to them. The hearts of kings are,\nindeed, very fickle. Granting protection at first, they strike with clubs at last. O prince (Duryodhana), thou regard-\nest thyself as mature in intellect, and, O thou of bad heart, thou regardest me as a child. But consider that he is a\nchild who having first accepted one for a friend, subsequently findeth fault with him. An evil-hearted man can nev-\ner be brought to the path of rectitude, like an unchaste wife in the house of a well-born person. Assuredly, instruc-\ntion is not agreeable to this bull of the Bharata race like a husband of sixty years to a damsel that is young. After\nthis, O king, if thou wishest to hear words that are agreeable to thee, in respect of all acts good or bad, ask thou\nwomen and idiots and cripples or persons of that description. A sinful man speaking words that are agreeable may\nbe had in this world. But a speaker of words that are disagreeable though sound as regimen, or a hearer of the same,\nis very rare. He indeed, is a king\u2019s true ally who disregarding what is agreeable or disagreeable to his master beareth\nhimself virtuously and uttereth what may be disagreeable but necessary as regimen. O great king, drink thou that\nwhich the honest drink and the dishonest shun, even humility, which is like a medicine that is bitter, pungent, burn-\ning, unintoxicating, disagreeable, and revolting. And drinking it, O king, regain thou thy sobriety. I always wish\nDhritarashtra and his sons affluence and fame. Happen what may unto thee, here I bow to thee (and take my leave).\nLet the Brahmanas wish me well. O son of Kuru, this is the lesson I carefully inculcate, that the wise should never\nenrage such as adders as have venom in their very glances!\u201d\nSection LXIV\n493 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u201cSakuni said,\u2014\u2019Thou hast, O Yudhishthira, lost much wealth of the Pandavas. If thou hast still anything that\nthou hast not yet lost to us, O son of Kunti, tell us what it is!\u201d\n\u201cYudhishthira said,--O son of Suvala, I know that I have untold wealth. But why is it, O Sakuni, that thou askest\nme of my wealth? Let tens of thousands and millions and millions and tens of millions and hundreds of millions\nand tens of billions and hundreds of billions and trillions and tens of trillions and hundreds of trillions and tens\nof quadrillions and hundreds of quadrillions and even more wealth be staked by thee. I have as much. With that\nwealth, O king, I will play with thee.\u201d\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dHearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting unfair means, said unto Yudhishthi-\nra, \u2018Lo, I have won!\u2019\n\u2018Yudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019I have, O son of Suvala, immeasurable kine and horses and milch cows with calves and\ngoats and sheep in the country extending from the Parnasa to the eastern bank of the Sindu. With this wealth, O\nking, I will play with thee.\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dHearing this Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting unfair means, said unto Yudhishthira,\n\u2018Lo, I have won!\u2019\nYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019I have my city, the country, land, the wealth of all dwelling therein except of the Brah-\nmanas, and all those persons themselves except Brahmanas still remaining to me. With this wealth, O king, I will\nplay with thee.\u2019\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dHearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting foul means, said unto Yudhishthira,\n\u2018Lo! I have won.\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said,--These princes here, O king, who look resplendent in their ornaments and their ear-rings\nand Nishkas and all the royal ornaments on their persons are now my wealth. With this wealth, O king, I play with\nthee.\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dHearing this, Sakuni, ready with his dice, adopting foul means, said unto Yudhishthira,\n\u2018Lo! I have won them.\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019This Nakula here, of mighty arms and leonine neck, of red eyes and endued with youth,\nis now my one stake. Know that he is my wealth.\u2019 Sakuni said,\u2014\u2019O king Yudhishthira, prince Nakula is dear to thee.\nHe is already under our subjection. With whom (as stake) wilt thou now play?\u201d\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dSaying this, Sakuni cast those dice, and said unto Yudhishthira, \u2018Lo! He hath been won\nby us.\u2019\nYudhishthira said,\u2014\u201dThis Sahadeva administereth justice. He hath also acquired a reputation for learning in\nthis world. However undeserving he may be to be staked in play, with him as stake I will play, with such a dear\nobject as it, indeed, he were not so!\u201d\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dHearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting foul means, said unto Yudhishthira,\n\u2018Lo! I have won.\u2019\n\u201cSakuni continued,\u2014\u2019O king, the sons of Madri, dear unto thee, have both been won by me. It would seem,\nhowever, that Bhimasena and Dhananjaya are regarded very much by thee.\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019Wretch! thou actest sinfully in thus seeking to create disunion amongst us who are all of\none heart, disregarding morality.\u2019\n\u201cSakuni said,\u2014\u2019One that is intoxicated falleth into a pit (hell) and stayeth there deprived of the power of mo-\ntion. Thou art, O king, senior to us in age, and possessed of the highest accomplishments. O bull of the Bharata\nrace, I (beg my pardon and) bow to thee. Thou knowest, O Yudhishthira, that gamesters, while excited with play,\nutter such ravings that they never indulge in the like of them in their waking moments nor even in dream.\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said,--He that taketh us like a boat to the other shore of the sea of battle, he that is ever victori-\nous over foes, the prince who is endued with great activity, he who is the one hero in this world, (is here). With that\nFalguna as stake, however, undeserving of being made so, I will now play with thee.\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dHearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting foul means, said unto Yudhishthira,\n\u2018Lo! I have won.\u2019\n\u201cSakuni continued,\u2014\u2019This foremost of all wielders of the bow, this son of Pandu capable of using both his\nhands with equal activity hath now been won by me. O play now with the wealth that is still left unto thee, even\nwith Bhima thy dear brother, as thy stake, O son of Pandu.\n\u201cYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019O king, however, undeserving he may be of being made a stake, I will now play with\nthee by staking Bhimasena, that prince who is our leader, who is the foremost in fight,--even like the wielder of the\nthunder-bolt--the one enemy of the Danavas,--the high-souled one with leonine neck and arched eye-brows and\neyes looking askance, who is incapable of putting up with an insult, who hath no equal in might in the world, who\nis the foremost of all wielders of the mace, and who grindeth all foes,\u2019\u201d \u201cVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dHearing this, Sakuni,\nready with the dice adopting foul means, said unto Yudhishthira. \u2018Lo! I have won.\u2019\nSakuni continued,--Thou hast, O son of Kunti, lost much wealth, horses and elephants and thy brothers as well.\n494 The Mahabharata\nSay, if thou hast anything which thou hast not lost.\u2019\nYudhishthira, said--\u2019I alone, the eldest of all my brothers and dear unto them, am still unwon. Won by thee, I\nwill do what he that is won will have to do.\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dHearing this Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting foul means, said unto Yudhishthira,\n\u2018Lo! I have won.\u2019\n\u2018Sakuni continued,\u2014\u2019Thou hast permitted thyself to be won. This is very sinful. There is wealth still left to thee,\nO king. Therefore, thy having lost thyself is certainly sinful.\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dHaving said this, Sakuni, well-skilled at dice, spoke unto all the brave kings pres-\nent there of his having won, one after another, all the Pandavas. The son of Suvala then, addressing Yudhishthira\nsaid,\u2014\u2019O king, there is still one stake dear to thee that is still unwon. Stake thou Krishna, the princess of Panchala.\nBy her, win thyself back.\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019With Draupadi as stake, who is neither short nor tall, neither spare nor corpulent, and\nwho is possessed of blue curly locks, I will now play with thee. Possessed of eyes like the leaves of the autumn lotus,\nand fragrant also as the autumn lotus, equal in beauty unto her (Lakshmi) who delighteth in autumn lotuses, and\nunto Sree herself in symmetry and every grace she is such a woman as a man may desire for wife in respect of\nsoftness of heart, and wealth of beauty and of virtues. Possessed of every accomplishment and compassionate and\nsweet-speeched, she is such a woman as a man may desire for wife in respect of her fitness for the acquisition of\nvirtue and pleasure and wealth. Retiring to bed last and waking up first, she looketh after all down to the cowherds\nand the shepherds. Her face too, when covered with sweat, looketh as the lotus or the jasmine. Of slender waist\nlike that of the wasp, of long flowing locks, of red lips, and body without down, is the princess of Panchala. O king,\nmaking the slender-waisted Draupadi, who is even such as my stake, I will play with thee, O son of Suvala.\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u2019When the intelligent king Yudhishthira the just has spoken thus,\u2014\u2019Fie!\u2019 \u2018Fie!\u2019 were\nthe words that were uttered by all the aged persons that were in the assembly. And the whole conclave was agitated,\nand the kings who were present there all gave way to grief. And Bhishma and Drona and Kripa were covered with\nperspiration. And Vidura holding his head between his hands sat like one that had lost his reason. He sat with face\ndownwards giving way to his reflections and sighing like a snake. But Dhritarashtra glad, at heart, asked repeatedly,\n\u2018Hath the stake been won?\u2019 \u2018Hath the stake been won?\u2019 and could not conceal his emotions. Karna with Dussassa-\nna and others laughed aloud, while tears began to flow from the eyes of all other present in the assembly. And the\nson of Suvala, proud of success and flurried with excitement and repeating. Thou hast one stake, dear to thee, etc.\nsaid,\u2014\u2019Lo! I have won\u2019 and took up the dice that had been cast.\u201d\nSection LXV\nDuryodhana said,\u2014\u2019Come, Kshatta, bring hither Draupadi the dear and loved wife of the Pandavas. Let her\nsweep the chambers, force her thereto, and let the unfortunate one stay where our serving-women are.\u2019\n\u201cVidura said,\u2014\u2019Dost thou not know, O wretch, that by uttering such harsh words thou art tying thyself with\ncords? Dost thou not understand that thou art hanging on the edge of a precipice? Dost thou not know that being\na deer thou provokest so many tigers to rage? Snakes of deadly venom, provoked to ire, are on thy head! Wretch,\ndo not further provoke them lest thou goest to the region of Yama. In my judgement, slavery does not attach to\nKrishna, in as much as she was staked by the King after he had lost himself and ceased to be his own master. Like\nthe bamboo that beareth fruit only when it is about to die, the son of Dhritarashtra winneth this treasure at play.\nIntoxicated, he perceiveth nor in these his last moments that dice bring about enmity and frightful terrors. No man\nshould utter harsh speeches and pierce the hearts of the others. No man should subjugate his enemies by dice and\nsuch other foul means. No one should utter such words as are disapproved by the Vedas and lead to hell and annoy\nothers. Some one uttereth from his lips words that are harsh. Stung by them another burneth day and night. These\nwords pierce the very heart of another. The learned, therefore, should never utter them, pointing them at others. A\ngoat had once swallowed a hook, and when it was pierced with it, the hunter placing the head of the animal on the\nground tore its throat frightfully in drawing it out. Therefore, O Duryodhana, swallow not the wealth of the Pan-\ndavas. Make them not thy enemies. The sons of Pritha never use words such as these. It is only low men that are like\ndogs who use harsh words towards all classes of people, viz., those that have retired to the woods, those leading do-\nmestic lives, those employed in ascetic devotions and those that are of great learning. Alas! the son of Dhritarashtra\nknoweth not that dishonesty is one of the frightful doors of hell. Alas! many of the Kurus with Dussasana amongst\nthem have followed him in the path of dishonesty in the matter of this play at dice. Even gourds may sink and\nstones may float, and boats also may always sink in water, still this foolish king, the son of Dhritarashtra, listeneth\nnot to my words that are even as regimen unto him. Without doubt, he will be the cause of the destruction of the\nKurus. When the words of wisdom spoken by friends and which are even as fit regimen are not listened to, but on\nthe other hand temptation is on the increase, a frightful and universal destruction is sure to overtake all the Kurus.\u201d\n495 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSection LXVI\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dIntoxicated with pride, the son of Dhritarashtra spake,\u2014\u2019Fie on Kshatta! and casting his\neyes upon the Pratikamin in attendance, commanded him, in the midst of all those reverend seniors, saying,\u2014\u2019Go\nPratikamin, and bring thou Draupadi hither. Thou hast no fear from the sons of Pandu. It is Vidura alone that\nraveth in fear. Besides, he never wisheth our prosperity!\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dThus commanded, the Pratikamin, who was of the Suta caste, hearing the words\nof the king, proceeded with haste, and entering the abode of the Pandavas, like a dog in a lion\u2019s den, approached\nthe queen of the sons of Pandu. And he said,\u2014\u2019Yudhishthira having been intoxicated with dice, Duryodhana, O\nDraupadi, hath won thee. Come now, therefore, to the abode of Dhritarashtra. I will take thee, O Yajnaseni, and put\nthee in some menial work.\u2019\nDraupadi said,\u2014\u2019Why, O Pratikamin, dost thou say so? What prince is there who playeth staking his wife? The\nking was certainly intoxicated with dice. Else, could he not find any other object to stake?\u2019\n\u201cThe Pratikamin said,\u2014\u2019When he had nothing else to stake, it was then that Ajatasatru, the son of Pandu,\nstaked thee. The king had first staked his brothers, then himself, and then thee, O princess.\u2019\n\u201cDraupadi said,\u2014\u2019O son of the Suta race, go, and ask that gambler present in the assembly, whom he hath lost\nfirst, himself, or me. Ascertaining this, come hither, and then take me with thee, O son of the Suta race.\u2019\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dThe messenger coming back to the assembly told all present the words of Draupa-\ndi. And he spoke unto Yudhishthira sitting in the midst of the kings, these words,--Draupadi hath asked thee,\nWhose lord wert thou at the time thou lost me in play? Didst thou lose thyself first or me? Yudhishthira, however\nsat there like one demented and deprived of reason and gave no answer good or ill to the Suta. \u201cDuryodhana then\nsaid,\u2014\u2019Let the princess of Panchala come hither and put her question. Let every one hear in this assembly the\nwords that pass between her and Yudhishthira.\u2019\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dThe messenger, obedient to the command of Duryodhana, going once again to the\npalace, himself much distressed, said unto Draupadi,\u2014\u2019O princess, they that are in the assembly are summoning\nthee. It seemeth that the end of the Kauravas is at hand. When Duryodhana, O princess, is for taking thee before\nthe assembly, this weak-brained king will no longer be able to protect his prosperity.\u2019\n\u201cDraupadi said,\u2014\u2019The great ordainer of the world hath, indeed, ordained so. Happiness and misery pay their\ncourt to both the wise and unwise. Morality, however, it hath been said, is the one highest object in the world. If\ncherished, that will certainly dispense blessings to us. Let not that morality now abandon the Kauravas. Going back\nto those that are present in that assembly, repeat these my words consonant with morality. I am ready to do what\nthose elderly and virtuous persons conversant with morality will definitely tell me.\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dThe Suta, hearing these words of Yajnaseni, came back to the assembly and re-\npeated the words of Draupadi. But all sat with faces downwards, uttering not a word, knowing the eagerness and\nresolution of Dhritarashtra\u2019s son.\n\u201cYudhishthira, however, O bull of the Bharata race, hearing of Duryodhana\u2019s intentions, sent a trusted mes-\nsenger unto Draupadi, directing that although she was attired in one piece of cloth with her navel itself exposed,\nin consequence of her season having come, she should come before her father-in-law weeping bitterly. And that\nintelligent messenger, O king, having gone to Draupadi\u2019s abode with speed, informed her of the intentions of Yud-\nhishthira. The illustrious Pandavas, meanwhile, distressed and sorrowful, and bound by promise, could not settle\nwhat they should do. And casting his eyes upon them, king Duryodhana, glad at heart, addressed the Suta and\nsaid,\u2014\u2019O Pratikamin, bring her hither. Let the Kauravas answer her question before her face. The Suta, then, obedi-\nent to his commands, but terrified at the (possible) wrath of the daughter of Drupada, disregarding his reputation\nfor intelligence, once again said to those that were in the assembly,--what shall I say unto Krishna?\u2019\n\u201cDuryodhana, hearing this, said,\u2014\u2019O Dussasana, this son of my Suta, of little intelligence, feareth Vrikodara.\nTherefore, go thou thyself and forcibly bring hither the daughter of Yajnasena, Our enemies at present are depen-\ndent on our will. What can they do thee?\u2019 Hearing the command of his brother, prince Dussasana rose with blood-\nred eyes, and entering the abode of those great warriors, spake these words unto the princess, \u2018Come, come, O\nKrishna, princess of Panchala, thou hast been won by us. And O thou of eyes large as lotus leaves, come now and\naccept the Kurus for thy lords. Thou hast been won virtuously, come to the assembly.\u2019 At these words, Draupadi,\nrising up in great affliction, rubbed her pale face with her hands, and distressed she ran to the place where the ladies\nof Dhritarashtra\u2019s household were. At this, Dussasana roaring in anger, ran after her and seized the queen by her\nlocks, so long and blue and wavy. Alas! those locks that had been sprinkled with water sanctified with mantras in\nthe great Rajasuya sacrifice, were now forcibly seized by the son of Dhritarashtra disregarding the prowess of the\nPandavas. And Dussasana dragging Krishna of long long locks unto the presence of the assembly--as if she were\nhelpless though having powerful protectors--and pulling at her, made her tremble like the banana plant in a storm.\n496 The Mahabharata\nAnd dragged by him, with body bent, she faintly cried--\u2019Wretch! it ill behoveth thee to take me before the assembly.\nMy season hath come, and I am now clad in one piece of attire. But Dussasana dragging Draupadi forcibly by her\nblack locks while she was praying piteously unto Krishna and Vishnu who were Narayana and Nara (on earth), said\nunto her--\u2019Whether thy season hath come or not, whether thou art attired in one piece of cloth or entirely naked,\nwhen thou hast been won at dice and made our slave, thou art to live amongst our serving-women as thou pleasest.\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dWith hair dishevelled and half her attire loosened, all the while dragged by Dus-\nsasana, the modest Krishna consumed with anger, faintly said--\u201dIn this assembly are persons conversant with all\nthe branches of learning devoted to the performance of sacrifices and other rites, and all equal unto Indra, persons\nsome of whom are really my superiors and others who deserve to be respected as such. I can not stay before them\nin this state. O wretch! O thou of cruel deeds, drag me not so. Uncover me not so. The princes (my lords) will not\npardon thee, even if thou hast the gods themselves with Indra as thy allies. The illustrious son of Dharma is now\nbound by the obligations of morality. Morality, however, is subtle. Those only that are possessed of great clearness\nof vision can ascertain it. In speech even I am unwilling to admit an atom of fault in my lord forgetting his virtues.\nThou draggest me who am in my season before these Kuru heroes. This is truly an unworthy act. But no one here\nrebuketh thee. Assuredly, all these are of the same mind with thee. O fie! Truly hath the virtue of the Bharata gone!\nTruly also hath the usage of those acquainted with the Kshatriya practice disappeared! Else these Kurus in this as-\nsembly would never have looked silently on this act that transgresseth the limits of their practices. Oh! both Drona\nand Bhishma have lost their energy, and so also hath the high-souled Kshatta, and so also this king. Else, why do\nthese foremost of the Kuru elders look silently on this great crime?\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dThus did Krishna of slender waist cry in distress in that assembly. And casting\na glance upon her enraged lords--the Pandavas--who were filled with terrible wrath, she inflamed them further\nwith that glance of hers. And they were not so distressed at having been robbed of their kingdom, of their wealth,\nof their costliest gems, as with that glance of Krishna moved by modesty and anger. And Dussasana, beholding\nKrishna looking at her helpless lords, dragging her still more forcibly, and addressed her, \u2018Slave, Slave\u2019 and laughed\naloud. And at those words Karna became very glad and approved of them by laughing aloud. And Sakuni, the son\nof Suvala, the Gandhara king, similarly applauded Dussasana. And amongst all those that were in the assembly\nexcept these three and Duryodhana, every one was filled with sorrow at beholding Krishna thus dragged in sight\nof that assembly. And beholding it all, Bhishma said, \u2018O blessed one, morality is subtle. I therefore am unable to\nduly decide this point that thou hast put, beholding that on the one hand one that hath no wealth cannot stake the\nwealth belonging to others, while on the other hand wives are always under the orders and at the disposal of their\nlords. Yudhishthira can abandon the whole world full of wealth, but he will never sacrifice morality. The son of\nPandu hath said--\u2019I am won.\u2019 Therefore, I am unable to decide this matter. Sakuni hath not his equal among men at\ndice-play. The son of Kunti still voluntarily staked with him. The illustrious Yudhishthira doth not himself regard\nthat Sakuni hath played with him deceitfully. Therefore, I can not decide this point.\u201d\n\u201cDraupadi said,\u2014\u201dThe king was summoned to this assembly and though possessing no skill at dice, he was\nmade to play with skilful, wicked, deceitful and desperate gamblers. How can he be said then to have staked volun-\ntarily? The chief of the Pandavas was deprived of his senses by wretches of deceitful conduct and unholy instincts,\nacting together, and then vanquished. He could not understand their tricks, but he hath now done so. Here, in this\nassembly, there are Kurus who are the lords of both their sons and their daughters-in-law! Let all of them, reflecting\nwell upon my words, duly decide the point that I have put.\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u2019Unto Krishna who was thus weeping and crying piteously, looking at times upon\nher helpless lord, Dussasana spake many disagreeable and harsh words. And beholding her who was then in her\nseason thus dragged, and her upper garments loosened, beholding her in that condition which she little deserved,\nVrikodara afflicted beyond endurance, his eyes fixed upon Yudhishthira, gave way to wrath.\u201d\nSection LXVII\n\u201cBhima said,\u2014\u2019O Yudhishthira, gamblers have in their houses many women of loose character. They do not yet\nstake those women having kindness for them even. Whatever wealth and other excellent articles the king of Kasi\ngave, whatever, gems, animals, wealth, coats of mail and weapons that other kings of the earth gave, our kingdom,\nthyself and ourselves, have all been won by the foes. At all this my wrath was not excited for thou art our lord. This,\nhowever, I regard as a highly improper act--this act of staking Draupadi. This innocent girl deserveth not this treat-\nment. Having obtained the Pandavas as her lords, it is for thee alone that she is being thus persecuted by the low,\ndespicable, cruel, and mean-minded Kauravas. It is for her sake, O king, that my anger falleth on thee. I shall burn\nthose hands of thine. Sahadeva, bring some fire.\u201d\n\u2018Arjuna hearing this, said,\u2014\u2019Thou hast never, O Bhimasena, before this uttered such words as these. Assuredly\nthy high morality hath been destroyed by these cruel foes. Thou shouldst not fulfil the wishes of the enemy. Practise\nthou the highest morality. Whom doth it behave to transgress his virtuous eldest brother? The king was summoned\n497 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nby the foe, and remembering the usage of the Kshatriyas, he played at dice against his will. That is certainly condu-\ncive to our great fame.\n\u2018Bhima said,\u2014\u2019If I had not known, O Dhananjaya, that the king had acted according to Kshatriya usage, then I\nwould have, taking his hands together by sheer force, burnt them in a blazing fire.\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dBeholding the Pandavas thus distressed and the princess of Panchala also thus\nafflicted, Vikarna the son of Dhritarashtra said--\u2019Ye kings, answer ye the question that hath been asked by Yajnase-\nni. If we do not judge a matter referred to us, all of us will assuredly have to go to hell without delay. How is that\nBhishma and Dhritarashtra, both of whom are the oldest of the Kurus, as also the high-souled Vidura, do not say\nanything! The son of Bharadwaja who is the preceptor of us, as also Kripa, is here. Why do not these best of regen-\nerate ones answer the question? Let also those other kings assembled here from all directions answer according to\ntheir judgment this question, leaving aside all motives of gain and anger. Ye kings, answer ye the question that hath\nbeen asked by this blessed daughter of king Drupada, and declare after reflection on which side each of ye is.\u2019 Thus\ndid Vikarna repeatedly appeal to those that were in that assembly. But those kings answered him not one word,\ngood or ill. And Vikarna having repeatedly appealed to all the kings began to rub his hands and sigh like a snake.\nAnd at last the prince said--\u2019Ye kings of the earth, ye Kauravas, whether ye answer this question or not, I will say\nwhat I regard as just and proper. Ye foremost of men, it hath been said that hunting, drinking, gambling, and too\nmuch enjoyment of women, are the four vices of kings. The man, that is addicted to these, liveth forsaking virtue.\nAnd people do not regard the acts done by a person who is thus improperly engaged, as of any authority. This son\nof Pandu, while deeply engaged in one of these vicious acts, urged thereto by deceitful gamblers, made Draupadi a\nstake. The innocent Draupadi is, besides, the common wife of all the sons of Pandu. And the king, having first lost\nhimself offered her as a stake. And Suvala himself desirous of a stake, indeed prevailed upon the king to stake this\nKrishna. Reflecting upon all these circumstances, I regard Draupadi as not won.\u201d\n\u201cHearing these words, a loud uproar rose from among those present in that assembly. And they all applaud-\ned Vikarna and censured the son of Suvala. And at that sound, the son of Radha, deprived of his senses by an-\nger, waving his well-shaped arms, said these words,\u2014\u2019O Vikarna, many opposite and inconsistent conditions are\nnoticeable in this assembly. Like fire produced from a faggot, consuming the faggot itself, this thy ire will consume\nthee. These personages here, though urged by Krishna, have not uttered a word. They all regard the daughter of\nDrupada to have been properly won. Thou alone, O son of Dhritarashtra in consequence of thy immature years, art\nbursting with wrath, for though but a boy thou speakest in the assembly as if thou wert old. O younger brother of\nDuryodhana, thou dost not know what morality truly is, for thou sayest like a fool that this Krishna who hath been\n(justly) won as not won at all. O son of Dhritarashtra, how dost thou regard Krishna as not won, when the eldest\nof the Pandavas before this assembly staked all his possessions? O bull of the Bharata race, Draupadi is included in\nall the possessions (of Yudhishthira). Therefore, why regardest thou Krishna who hath been justly won as not won?\nDraupadi had been mentioned (by Suvala) and approved of as a stake by the Pandavas. For what reason then dost\nthou yet regard her as not won? Or, if thou thinkest that bringing her hither attired in a single piece of cloth, is an\naction of impropriety, listen to certain excellent reasons I will give. O son of the Kuru race, the gods have ordained\nonly one husband for one woman. This Draupadi, however, hath many husbands. Therefore, certain it is that she is\nan unchaste woman. To bring her, therefore, into this assembly attired though she be in one piece of cloth--even to\nuncover her is not at all an act that may cause surprise. Whatever wealth the Pandavas had--she herself and these\nPandavas themselves,--have all been justly won by the son of Suvala. O Dussasana, this Vikarna speaking words\nof (apparent) wisdom is but a boy. Take off the robes of the Pandavas as also the attire of Draupadi. Hearing these\nwords the Pandavas, O Bharata, took of their upper garments and throwing them down sat in that assembly. Then\nDussasana, O king, forcibly seizing Draupadi\u2019s attire before the eyes of all, began to drag it off her person.\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dWhen the attire of Draupadi was being thus dragged, the thought of Hari, (And\nshe herself cried aloud, saying), \u2018O Govinda, O thou who dwellest in Dwaraka, O Krishna, O thou who art fond of\ncow-herdesses (of Vrindavana). O Kesava, seest thou not that the Kauravas are humiliating me. O Lord, O husband\nof Lakshmi, O Lord of Vraja (Vrindavana), O destroyer of all afflictions, O Janarddana, rescue me who am sinking in\nthe Kaurava Ocean. O Krishna, O Krishna, O thou great yogin, thou soul of the universe, Thou creator of all things,\nO Govinda, save me who am distressed,--who am losing my senses in the midst of the Kurus.\u2019 Thus did that afflicted\nlady resplendent still in her beauty, O king covering her face cried aloud, thinking of Krishna, of Hari, of the lord of\nthe three worlds. Hearing the words of Draupadi, Krishna was deeply moved. And leaving his seat, the benevolent\none from compassion, arrived there on foot. And while Yajnaseni was crying aloud to Krishna, also called Vishnu\nand Hari and Nara for protection, the illustrious Dharma, remaining unseen, covered her with excellent clothes of\nmany hues. And, O monarch as the attire of Draupadi was being dragged, after one was taken off, another of the\nsame kind, appeared covering her. And thus did it continue till many clothes were seen. And, O exalted on, owing to\nthe protection of Dharma, hundreds upon hundreds of robes of many hues came off Draupadi\u2019s person. And there\narose then a deep uproar of many many voices. And the kings present in that assembly beholding that most extraor-\n498 The Mahabharata\ndinary of all sights in the world, began to applaud Draupadi and censure the son of Dhritarashtra. And Bhima then,\nsqueezing his hands, with lips quivering in rage, swore in the midst of all those kings a terrible oath in a loud voice.\n\u201cAnd Bhima said,--Hear these words of mine, ye Kshatriyas of the world. Words such as these were never before\nuttered by other men, nor will anybody in the future ever utter them. Ye lords of earth, if having spoken these\nwords I do not accomplish them hereafter, let me not obtain the region of my deceased ancestors. Tearing open in\nbattle, by sheer force, the breast of this wretch, this wicked-minded scoundrel of the Bharata race, if I do not drink\nhis life-blood, let me not obtain the region of my ancestors.\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dHearing these terrible words of Bhima that made the down of the auditors to stand\non end, everybody present there applauded him and censured the son of Dhritarashtra. And when a mass of clothes\nhad been gathered in that assembly, all dragged from the person of Draupadi, Dussasana, tired and ashamed,\nsat down. And beholding the sons of Kunti in that state, the persons--those gods among men--that were in that\nassembly all uttered the word \u2018Fie!\u2019(on the son of Dhritarashtra). And the united voices of all became so loud that\nthey made the down of anybody who heard them stand on end. And all the honest men that were in that assembly\nbegan to say,\u2014\u2019Alas! the Kauravas answer not the question that hath been put to them by Draupadi. And all cen-\nsuring Dhritarashtra together, made a loud clamour. Then Vidura, that master of the science of morality, waving his\nhands and silencing every one, spake these words;\u2014\u2019Ye that are in this assembly, Draupadi having put her ques-\ntion is weeping helplessly. Ye are not answering her. Virtue and morality are being persecuted by such conduct. An\nafflicted person approacheth an assembly of good men, like one that is being consumed by fire. They that are in the\nassembly quench that fire and cool him by means of truth and morality. The afflicted person asketh the assembly\nabout his rights, as sanctioned by morality. They that are in the assembly should, unmoved by interest and anger,\nanswer the question. Ye kings, Vikarna hath answered the question, according to his own knowledge and judgment.\nYe should also answer it as ye think proper. Knowing the rules of morality, and having attended an assembly, he that\ndoth not answer a query that is put, incurreth half the demerit that attacheth to a lie. He, on the other hand, who,\nknowing the rules of morality and having joined an assembly answereth falsely, assuredly incurreth the sin of a lie.\nThe learned quote as an example in this connection the old history of Prahlada and the son of Angirasa.\n\u201cThere was of old a chief of the Daityas of the name Prahlada. He had a son named Virochana. And Virochana,\nfor the sake of obtaining a bride, quarrelled with Sudhanwan, the son of Angiras. It hath been heard by us that they\nmutually wagered their lives, saying--I am superior,--I am superior,--for the sake of obtaining a bride. And after\nthey had thus quarrelled with each other, they both made Prahlada the arbitrator to decide between them. And they\nasked him, saying;--Who amongst us is superior (to the other)? Answer this question. Speak not falsely. Frightened\nat this quarrel, Prahlada cast his eyes upon Sudhanwan. And Sudhanwan in rage, burning like unto the mace of\nYama, told him,--If thou answerest falsely, or dost not answer at all thy head will then be split into a hundred pieces\nby the wielder of the thunderbolt with that bolt of his.--Thus addressed by Sudhanwan, the Daitya, trembling like\na leaf of the fig tree, went to Kasyapa of great energy, for taking counsel with him. And Prahlada said,\u2014\u2019Thou art,\nO illustrious and exalted one, fully conversant with the rules of morality that should guide both the gods and the\nAsuras and the Brahmanas as well. Here, however, is a situation of great difficulty in respect of duty. Tell me, I ask\nthee, what regions are obtainable by them who upon being asked a question, answer it not, or answer it falsely.\nKasyapa thus asked answered.\u2014\u2019He that knoweth, but answereth not a question from temptation, anger or fear,\ncasteth upon himself a thousand nooses of Varuna. And the person who, cited as a witness with respect to any mat-\nter of ocular or auricular knowledge, speaketh carelessly, casteth a thousand nooses of Varuna upon his own per-\nson. On the completion of one full year, one such noose is loosened. Therefore, he that knoweth, should speak the\ntruth without concealment. If virtue, pierced by sin, repaireth to an assembly (for aid), it is the duty of every body\nin the assembly to take off the dart, otherwise they themselves would be pierced with it. In an assembly where a tru-\nly censurable act is not rebuked, half the demerit of that act attacheth to the head of that assembly, a fourth to the\nperson acting censurably and a fourth unto those others that are there. In that assembly, on the other hand, when\nhe that deserveth censure is rebuked, the head of the assembly becometh freed from all sins, and the other members\nalso incur none. It is only the perpetrator himself of the act that becometh responsible for it. O Prahlada, they who\nanswer falsely those that ask them about morality destroy the meritorious acts of their seven upper and seven lower\ngenerations. The grief of one who hath lost all his wealth, of one who hath lost a son, of one who is in debt, of one\nwho is separated from his companions, of a woman who hath lost her husband, of one that hath lost his all in con-\nsequence of the king\u2019s demand, of a woman who is sterile, of one who hath been devoured by a tiger (during his last\nstruggles in the tiger\u2019s claws), of one who is a co-wife, and of one who hath been deprived of his property by false\nwitnesses, have been said by the gods to be uniform in degree. These different sorts of grief are his who speaketh\nfalse. A person becometh a witness in consequence of his having seen, heard, and understood a thing. Therefore, a\nwitness should always tell the truth. A truth-telling witness never loseth his religious merits and earthly possessions\nalso.\u2019 Hearing these words of Kasyapa, Prahlada told his son, \u201cSudhanwan is superior to thee, as indeed, (his father)\nAngiras is superior to me. The mother also of Sudhanwan is superior to thy mother. Therefore, O Virochana, this\n499 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSudhanwan is now the lord of the life.\u201d At these words of Prahlada, Sudhanwan said, \u201cSince unmoved by affection\nfor thy child, thou hast adhered to virtue, I command, let this son of thine live for a hundred years.\u201d\n\u201cVidura continued,--Let all the persons, therefore, present in this assembly hearing these high truths of morali-\nty, reflect upon what should be the answer to the question asked by Draupadi\u201d.\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dThe kings that were there hearing these words of Vidura, answered not a word, yet\nKarna alone spoke unto Dussasana, telling him. Take away this serving-woman Krishna into the inner apartments.\nAnd thereupon Dussasana began to drag before all the spectators the helpless and modest Draupadi, trembling and\ncrying piteously unto the Pandavas her lords.\u201d\nSection LXVIII\nDraupadi said,\u2014\u2019Wait a little, thou worst of men, thou wicked-minded Dussasana. I have an act to perform--a\nhigh duty that hath not been performed by me yet. Dragged forcibly by this wretch\u2019s strong arms, I was deprived of\nmy senses. I salute these reverend seniors in this assembly of the Kurus. That I could not do this before cannot be\nmy fault.\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dDragged with greater force than before, the afflicted and helpless Draupadi, undeserving\nof such treatment, falling down upon the ground, thus wept in that assembly of the Kurus,\u2014\n\u201c\u2019Alas, only once before, on the occasion of the Swayamvara, I was beheld by the assembled kings in the am-\nphitheatre, and never even once beheld afterwards. I am to-day brought before this assembly. She whom even the\nwinds and the sun had seen never before in her palace is to-day before this assembly and exposed to the gaze of\nthe crowd. Alas, she whom the sons of Pandu could not, while in her palace, suffer to be touched even by the wind,\nis to-day suffered by the Pandavas to be seized and dragged by this wretch. Alas, these Kauravas also suffer their\ndaughter-in-law, so unworthy of such treatment, to be thus afflicted before them. It seemeth that the times are out\nof joint. What can be more distressing to me, than that though high-born and chaste, I should yet be compelled to\nenter this public court? Where is that virtue for which these kings were noted? It hath been heard that the kings\nof ancient days never brought their wedded wives into the public court. Alas, that eternal usage hath disappeared\nfrom among the Kauravas. Else, how is it that the chaste wife of the Pandavas, the sister of Prishata\u2019s son, the friend\nof Vasudeva, is brought before this assembly? Ye Kauravas, I am the wedded wife of king Yudhishthira the just,\nhailing from the same dynasty to which the King belonged. Tell me now if I am a serving-maid or otherwise. I will\ncheerfully accept your answer. This mean wretch, this destroyer of the name of the Kurus, is afflicting me hard. Ye\nKauravas, I cannot bear it any longer. Ye kings, I desire ye to answer whether ye regard me as won or unwon. I will\naccept your verdict whatever it be.\u2019\n\u201cHearing these words, Bhishma answered, I have already said, O blessed one that the course of morality is subtle.\nEven the illustrious wise in this world fail to understand it always. What in this world a strong man calls morality\nis regarded as such by others, however otherwise it may really be; but what a weak man calls morality is scarcely\nregarded as such even if it be the highest morality. From the importance of the issue involved, from its intricacy and\nsubtlety, I am unable to answer with certitude the question thou hast asked. However, it is certain that as all the Ku-\nrus have become the slaves of covetousness and folly, the destruction of this our race will happen on no distant date.\nO blessed one, the family into which thou hast been admitted as a daughter-in-law, is such that those who are born in\nit, however much they might be afflicted by calamities, never deviate from the paths of virtue and morality. O Prin-\ncess of Panchala, this conduct of thine also, viz. that though sunk in distress, thou still easiest thy eyes on virtue and\nmorality, is assuredly worthy of thee. These persons, Drona and others, of mature years and conversant with morality,\nsit heads downwards like men that are dead, with bodies from which life hath departed. It seemeth to me, however,\nthat Yudhishthira is an authority on this question. It behoveth him to declare whether thou art won or not won.\u201d\nSection LXIX\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dThe kings present in that assembly, from tear of Duryodhana, uttered not a word, good\nor ill, although they beheld Draupadi crying piteously in affliction like a female osprey, and repeatedly appealing to\nthem. And the son of Dhritarashtra beholding those kings and sons and grand sons of kings all remaining silent,\nsmiled a little, and addressing the daughter of the king of Panchala, said,--O Yajnaseni, the question thou hast put\ndependeth on thy husbands--on Bhima of mighty strength, on Arjuna, on Nakula, on Sahadeva. Let them answer\nthy question. O Panchali, let them for thy sake declare in the midst of these respectable men that Yudhishthira is\nnot their lord, let them thereby make king Yudhishthira the just a liar. Thou shalt then be freed from the condition\nof slavery. Let the illustrious son of Dharma, always adhering to virtue, who is even like Indra, himself declare\nwhether he is not thy lord. At his words, accept thou the Pandavas or ourselves without delay. Indeed, all the Kau-\nravas present in this assembly are floating in the ocean of thy distress. Endued with magnanimity, they are unable\nto answer thy question, looking at thy unfortunate husbands.\u2019\u201d Vaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dHearing these words of\n500 The Mahabharata\nthe Kuru king, all who were present in the assembly loudly applauded them. And shouting approvingly, they made\nsigns unto one another by motions of their eyes and lips. And amongst some that were there, sounds of distress\nsuch as \u2018O! and \u2018Alas!\u201d were heard. And at these words of Duryodhana, so delightful (to his partisans), the Kauravas\npresent in that assembly became exceedingly glad. And the kings, with faces turned sideways, looked upon Yud-\nhishthira conversant with the rules of morality, curious to hear what he would say. And every one present in that\nassembly became curious to hear what Arjuna, the son of Pandu never defeated in battle, and what Bhimasena, and\nwhat the twins also would say. And when that busy hum of many voices became still, Bhimasena, waving his strong\nand well-formed arms smeared with sandalpaste spake these words,\u2014\u2019If this high-souled king Yudhishthira the\njust, who is our eldest brother, had not been our lord, we would never have forgiven the Kuru race (for all this). He\nis the lord of all our religious and ascetic merits, the lord of even our lives. If he regardeth himself as won, we too\nhave all been won. If this were not so, who is there amongst creatures touching the earth with their feet and mortal,\nthat would escape from me with his life after having touched those locks of the princess of Panchala? Behold these\nmighty, well-formed arms of mine, even like maces of iron. Having once come within them, even he of a hundred\nsacrifices is incapable of effecting an escape. Bound by the ties of virtue and the reverence that is due to our eldest\nbrother, and repeatedly urged by Arjuna to remain silent, I am not doing anything terrible. If however, I am once\ncommanded by king Yudhishthira the just, I would slay these wretched sons of Dhritarashtra, making slaps do the\nwork of swords, like a lion slaying a number of little animals.\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dUnto Bhima who had spoken these words Bhishma and Drona and Vidura said,\n\u2018Forbear, O Bhima. Everything is possible with thee.\u2019\u201d\nSection LXX\n\u201cKarna said,\u2014\u2019Of all the persons in the assembly, three, viz., Bhishma, Vidura, and the preceptor of the Kurus\n(Drona) appear to be independent; for they always speak of their master as wicked, always censure him, and nev-\ner wish for his prosperity. O excellent one, the slave, the son, and the wife are always dependent. They cannot earn\nwealth, for whatever they earn belongeth to their master. Thou art the wife of a slave incapable of possessing anything\non his own account. Repair now to the inner apartments of king Dhritarashtra and serve the king\u2019s relatives. We direct\nthat that is now thy proper business. And, O princess, all the sons of Dhritarashtra and not the sons of Pritha are now\nthy masters. O handsome one, select thou another husband now,--one who will not make thee a slave by gambling.\nIt is well-known that women, especially that are slaves, are not censurable if they proceed with freedom in electing\nhusbands. Therefore let it be done by thee. Nakula hath been won, as also Bhimasena, and Yudhishthira also, and\nSahadeva, and Arjuna. And, O Yajnaseni, thou art now a slave. Thy husbands that are slaves cannot continue to be thy\nlords any longer. Alas, doth not the son of Pritha regards life, prowess and manhood as of no use that he offereth this\ndaughter of Drupada, the king of Panchala, in the presence of all this assembly, as a stake at dice?\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dHearing these words, the wrathful Bhima breathed hard, a very picture of woe.\nObedient to the king and bound by the tie of virtue and duty, burning everything with his eyes inflamed by anger,\nhe said,\u2014\u2019O king, I cannot be angry at these words of this son of a Suta, for we have truly entered the state of servi-\ntude. But O king, could our enemies have said so unto me, it thou hadst not played staking this princess?\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dHearing these words of Bhimasena king Duryodhana addressed Yudhishthira\nwho was silent and deprived of his senses, saying,\u2014\u2019O king, both Bhima and Arjuna, and the twins also, are under\nthy sway. Answer thou the question (that hath been asked by Draupadi). Say, whether thou regardest Krishna as\nunwon.\u2019 And having spoken thus unto the son of Kunti, Duryodhana. desirous of encouraging the son of Radha and\ninsulting Bhima, quickly uncovered his left thigh that was like unto the stem of a plantain tree or the trunk of an\nelephant and which was graced with every auspicious sign and endued with the strength of thunder, and showed it\nto Draupadi in her very sight. And beholding this, Bhimasena expanding his red eyes, said unto Duryodhana in the\nmidst of all those kings and as if piercing them (with his dart-like words),\u2014\u2019Let not Vrikodara attain to the regions,\nobtained by his ancestors, if he doth not break that thigh of thine in the great conflict. And sparkles of fire began to\nbe emitted from every organ of sense of Bhima filled with wrath, like those that come out of every crack and orifice\nin the body of a blazing tree.\nVidura then, addressing everybody, said,\u2014\u2019Ye kings of Pratipa\u2019s race, behold the great danger that ariseth from\nBhimasena. Know ye for certain that this great calamity that threatens to overtake the Bharatas hath been sent by\nDestiny itself. The sons of Dhritarashtra have, indeed, gambled disregarding every proper consideration. They are\neven now disputing in this assembly about a lady (of the royal household). The prosperity of our kingdom is at an\nend. Alas, the Kauravas are even now engaged in sinful consultations. Ye Kauravas, take to your heart this high\nprecept that I declare. If virtue is persecuted, the whole assembly becometh polluted. If Yudhishthira had staked\nher before he was himself won, he would certainly have been regarded as her master. If, however a person staketh\nanything at a time when he himself is incapable of holding any wealth, to win it is very like obtaining wealth in a\n501 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ndream. Listening to the words of the king of Gandhara, fall ye not off from this undoubted truth.\u2019\n\u201cDuryodhana, hearing Vidura thus speak, said,\u2014\u2019I am willing to abide by the words of Bhima, of Arjuna and of\nthe twins. Let them say that Yudhishthira is not their master. Yajnaseni will then be freed from her state of bondage.\u201d\n\u201cArjuna at this, said,\u2014\u201dThis illustrious son of Kunti, king Yudhishthira the just, was certainly our master before\nhe began to play. But having lost himself, let all the Kauravas judge whose master he could be after that.\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dJust then, a jackal began to cry loudly in the homa-chamber of king Dhritarashtra\u2019s\npalace. And, O king, unto the jackal that howled so, the asses began to bray responsively. And terrible birds also,\nfrom all sides, began to answer with their cries. And Vidura conversant with everything and the daughter of Suvala,\nboth understood the meaning of those terrible sounds. And Bhishma and Drona and the learned Gautama loud-\nly cried,--Swashti! Swashti! 1 Then Gandhari and the learned Vidura beholding that frightful omen, represented\neverything, in great affliction, unto the king. And the king (Dhritarashtra) thereupon said,\u2014\n\u2018Thou wicked-minded Duryodhana, thou wretch, destruction hath all ready overtaken thee when thou insultest\nin language such as this the wife of these bulls among the Kurus, especially their wedded wife Draupadi. And hav-\ning spoken those words, the wise Dhritarashtra endued with knowledge, reflecting with the aid of his wisdom and\ndesirous of saving his relatives and friends from destruction, began to console Krishna, the princess of Panchala,\nand addressing her, the monarch said,\u2014\u2019Ask of me any boon, O princess of Panchala, that thou desirest, Chaste and\ndevoted to virtue, thou art the first of all my daughters-in-law.\n\u201cDraupadi said,\u2014\u2019O bull of the Bharata race, if thou will grant me a boon, I ask the handsome Yudhishthira,\nobedient to every duty, be freed from slavery. Let not unthinking children call my child Prativindhya endued with\ngreat energy of mind as the son of a slave. Having been a prince, so superior to all men, and nurtured by kings it is\nnot proper that he should be called the child of a slave.\n\u201cDhritarashtra said unto her,\u2014\u2019O auspicious one, let it be as thou sayest. O excellent one, ask thou another\nboon, for I will give it. My heart inclineth to give thee a second boon. Thou dost not deserve only one boon.\n\u201cDraupadi said,\u2014\u2019I ask, O king, that Bhimasena and Dhananjaya and the twins also, with their cars and bows,\nfreed from bondage, regain their liberty.\u2019\n\u2018Dhritarashtra said,\u2014\u2019O blessed daughter, let it be as thou desirest. Ask thou a third boon, for thou hast not\nbeen sufficiently honoured with two boons. Virtuous in thy behaviour, thou art the foremost of all my daughters-in-\nlaw.\nDraupadi said,\u2014\u2019O best of kings, O illustrious one, covetousness always bringeth about loss of virtue. I do not\ndeserve a third boon. Therefore I dare not ask any. O king of kings, it hath been said that a Vaisya may ask one\nboon; a Kshatriya lady, two boons; a Kshatriya male, three, and a Brahmana, a hundred. O king, these my husbands\nfreed from the wretched state of bondage, will be able to achieve prosperity by their own virtuous acts!\u2019\u201d\nSection LXXI\n\u201cKarna said,\u2014\u2019We have never heard of such an act (as this one of Draupadi), performed by any of the women\nnoted in this world for their beauty. When the sons of both Pandu and Dhritarashtra were excited with wrath, this\nDraupadi became unto the sons of Pandu as their salvation. Indeed the princess of Panchala, becoming as a boat\nunto the sons of Pandu who were sinking in a boatless ocean of distress, hath brought them in safety to the shore.\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dHearing these words of Karna in the midst of the Kurus,--viz., that the sons of\nPandu were saved by their wife,--the angry Bhimasena in great affliction said (unto Arjuna),\u2014\u2019O Dhananjaya, it\nhath been said by Devala three lights reside in every person, viz., offspring, acts and learning, for from these three\nhath sprung creation. When life becometh extinct and the body becometh impure and is cast off by relatives, these\nthree become of service to every person. But the light that is in us hath been dimmed by this act of insult to our\nwife. How, O Arjuna, can a son born from this insulted wife of ours prove serviceable to us? \u201cArjuna replied,\u2014\u2019Su-\nperior persons, O Bharata, never prate about the harsh words that may or may not be uttered by inferior men.\nPersons that have earned respect for themselves, even if they are able to retaliate, remember not the acts of hostility\ndone by their enemies, but, on the other hand, treasure up only their good deeds.\u2019\n\u2018Bhima said,\u2014\u2019Shall I, O king, slay, without loss of time all these foes assembled together, even here, or shall I\ndestroy them, O Bharata, by the roots, outside this palace? Or, what need is there of words or of command? I shall\nslay all these even now, and rule thou the whole earth, O king, without a rival. And saying this, Bhima with his\nyounger brothers, like a lion in the midst of a herd of inferior animals, repeatedly cast his angry glances around.\nBut Arjuna, however, of white deeds, with appealing looks began to pacify his elder brother. And the mighty-armed\nhero endued with great prowess began to burn with the fire of his wrath. And, O king, this fire began to issue out\nof Vrikodara\u2019s ears and other senses with smoke and sparks and flames. And his face became terrible to behold\nin consequence of his furrowed brows like those of Yama himself at the time of the universal destruction. Then\nYudhishthira forbade the mighty hero, embracing him with his arms and telling him \u2018Be not so. Stay in silence and\n502 The Mahabharata\npeace.\u2019 And having pacified the mighty-armed one with eyes red in wrath, the king approached his uncle Dhri-\ntarashtra, with hands joined in entreaty.\u201d\nSection LXXII\n\u201cYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019O king, thou art our master. Command us as to what we shall do. O Bharata, we desire to\nremain always in obedience to thee.\n\u201cDhritarashtra replied.\u2014\u2019O Ajatasatru, blest be thou. Go thou in peace and safety. Commanded by me, go, rule\nthy own kingdom with thy wealth. And, O child, take to heart this command of an old man, this wholesome advice\nthat I give, and which is even a nutritive regimen. O Yudhishthira, O child, thou knowest the subtle path of morali-\nty. Possessed of great wisdom, thou art also humble, and thou waitest also upon the old. Where there is intelligence,\nthere is forbearance. Therefore, O Bharata, follow thou counsels of peace. The axe falleth upon wood, not upon\nstone. (Thou art open to advice, not Duryodhana). They are the best of men that remember not the acts of hostil-\nity of their foes; that behold only the merits, not the faults, of their enemies; and that never enter into hostilities\nthemselves. They that are good remember only the good deeds of their foes and not the hostile acts their foes might\nhave done unto them. The good, besides, do good unto others without expectation of any good, in return. O Yud-\nhishthira, it is only the worst of men that utter harsh words in quarrelling; while they that are indifferent reply to\nsuch when spoken by others. But they that are good and wise never think of or recapitulate such harsh words, little\ncaring whether these may or may not have been uttered by their foes. They that are good, having regard to the state\nof their own feelings, can understand the feelings of others, and therefore remember only the good deeds and not\nthe acts of hostility of their foes. Thou hast acted even as good men of prepossessing countenance do, who trans-\ngress not the limits of virtue, wealth, pleasure and salvation. O child, remember not the harsh words of Duryodha-\nna. Look at thy mother Gandhari and myself also, if thou desirest to remember only what is good. O Bharata, look\nat me, who am thy father unto you and am old and blind, and still alive. It was for seeing our friends and examin-\ning also the strength and weakness of my children, that I had, from motives of policy, suffered this match at dice\nto proceed. O king those amongst the Kurus that have thee for their ruler, and the intelligent Vidura conversant\nwith every branch of learning for their counsellor, have, indeed, nothing to grieve for. In thee is virtue, in Arjuna is\npatience, in Bhimasena is prowess, and the twins, those foremost of men, is pure reverence for superiors. Blest be\nthou, O Ajatasatru. Return to Khandavaprastha, and let there be brotherly love between thee and thy cousins. Let\nthy heart also be ever fixed on virtue.\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dThat foremost of the Bharatas--king Yudhishthira the just--then, thus addressed\nby his uncle, having gone through every ceremony of politeness, set out with his brothers for Khandavaprastha.\nAnd accompanied by Draupadi and ascending their cars which were all of the hue of the clouds, with cheerful\nhearts they all set out for that best of cities called Indraprastha.\u201d\nSection LXXIII\nJanamejaya said,\u2014\u201dHow did the sons of Dhritarashtra feel, when they came to know that the Pandavas had,\nwith Dhritarashtra\u2019s leave, left Hastinapore with all their wealth and jewels?\u201d\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dO king, learning that the Pandavas had been commanded by the wise Dhritarashtra\nto return to their capital, Dussasana went without loss of time unto his brother. And, O bull of the Bharata race,\nhaving arrived before Duryodhana with his counsellor, the prince, afflicted with grief, began to say,\u2014\u2019Ye mighty\nwarriors, that which we had won after so much trouble, the old man (our father) hath thrown away. Know ye that\nhe hath made over the whole of that wealth to the foes. At these words, Duryodhana and Karna and Sakuni, the\nson of Suvala, all of whom were guided by vanity, united together, and desirous of counteracting the sons of Pandu,\napproaching in haste saw privately the wise king Dhritarashtra--the son of Vichitravirya and spake unto him these\npleasing and artful words. Duryodhana said,\u2014\n\u2018Hast thou not heard, O king, what the learned Vrihaspati the preceptor of the celestials, said in course of coun-\nselling Sakra about mortals and politics? Even these, O slayer of foes, were the words of Vrihaspati, \u2018Those enemies\nthat always do wrong by stratagem or force, should be slain by every means.\u2019 If, therefore, with the wealth of the\nPandavas, we gratify the kings of the earth and then fight with the sons of Pandu, what reverses can overtake us?\nWhen one hath placed on the neck and back of venomous snakes full of wrath for encompassing his destruction, is\nit possible for him to take them off? Equipped with weapon and seated on their cars, the angry sons of Pandu like\nwrathful and venomous snakes will assuredly annihilate us, O father. Even now Arjuna proceedeth, encased in mail\nand furnished with his couple of quivers, frequently taking up the Gandiva and breathing hard and casting angry\nglances around. It hath (also) been heard by us that Vrikodara, hastily ordering his car to be made ready and riding\non it, is proceeding along, frequently whirling his heavy mace. Nakula also is going along, with the sword in his\ngrasp and the semi-circular shield in his hand. And Sahadeva and the king (Yudhishthira) have made signs clearly\ntestifying to their intentions. Having ascended their cars that are full of all kinds of arms, they are whipping their\n503 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nhorses (for going to Khandava soon) and assembling their forces. Persecuted thus by us they are incapable of for-\ngiving us those injuries. Who is there among them that will forgive that insult to Draupadi? Blest be thou. We will\nagain gamble with the son of Pandu for sending them to exile. O bull among men, we are competent to bring them\nthus under our sway. Dressed in skins, either we or they defeated at dice, shall repair to the woods for twelve years.\nThe thirteenth year shall have to be spent in some inhabited country unrecognised; and, if recognised, an exile for\nanother twelve years shall be the consequence. Either we or they shall live so. Let the play begin, casting the dice,\nlet the sons of Pandu once more play. O bull of the Bharata race, O king, even this is our highest duty. This Sakuni\nknoweth well the whole science of dice. Even if they succeed in observing this vow for thirteen years, we shall be in\nthe meantime firmly rooted in the kingdom and making alliances, assemble a vast invincible host and keep them\ncontent, so that we shall, O king, defeat the sons of Pandu if they reappear. Let this plan recommend itself to thee, O\nslayer of foes.\n\u201cDhritarashtra said,--Bring back the Pandavas then, indeed, even if they have gone a great way. Let them come\nat once again to cast dice.\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dThen Drona, Somadatta and Valhika, Gautama, Vidura, the son of Drona, and the\nmighty son of Dhritarashtra by his Vaisya wife, Bhurisravas, and Bhishma, and that mighty warrior Vikarna,--all\nsaid, \u2018Let not the play commence. Let there be peace. But Dhritarashtra, partial to his sons, disregarding the coun-\nsels of all his wise friends and relatives, summoned the sons of Pandu.\u201d\nSection LXXIV\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u2019O monarch, it was then that the virtuous Gandhari, afflicted with grief on account of\nher affection for her sons, addressed king Dhritarashtra and said, \u201cWhen Duryodhana was born, Vidura of great\nintelligence had said, \u2018It is well to send this disgrace of the race to the other world. He cried repeatedly and disso-\nnantly like a jackal. It is certain he will prove the destruction of our race. Take this to heart, O king of the Kurus. O\nBharata, sink not, for thy own fault, into an ocean of calamity. O lord, accord not thy approbation to the counsels of\nthe wicked ones of immature years. Be not thou the cause of the terrible destruction of this race. Who is there that\nwill break an embankment which hath been completed, or re-kindle a conflagration which hath been extinguished?\nO bull of the Bharata race, who is there that will provoke the peaceful sons of Pritha? Thou rememberest, O Ajami-\nda, everything, but still I will call thy attention to this. The scriptures can never control the wicked-minded for good\nor evil. And, O king, a person of immature understanding will never act as one of mature years. Let thy sons follow\nthee as their leader. Let them not be separated from thee for ever (by losing their lives). Therefore, at my word, O\nking, abandon this wretch of our race. Thou couldst not, O king, from parental affection, do it before. Know that\nthe time hath come for the destruction of race through him. Err not, O king. Let thy mind, guided by counsels of\npeace, virtue, and true policy, be what it naturally is. That prosperity which is acquired by the aid of wicked acts, is\nsoon destroyed; while that which is won by mild means taketh root and descendeth from generation to generation.\u201d\n\u201cThe king, thus addressed by Gandhari who pointed out to him in such language the path of virtue, replied\nunto her, saying,\u2014\u2019If the destruction of our race is come, let it take place freely. I am ill able to prevent it. Let it be\nas they (these my sons) desire. Let the Pandavas return. And let my sons again gamble with the sons of Pandu.\u201d\nSection LXXV\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u2019The royal messenger, agreeably to the commands of the intelligent king Dhritarashtra,\ncoming upon Yudhishthira, the son of Pritha who had by that time gone a great way, addressed the monarch and\nsaid,\u2014\u2019Even these are the words of thy father-like uncle, O Bharata, spoken unto thee, \u2018The assembly is ready. O son\nof Pandu, O king Yudhisthira, come and cast the dice.\u2019\nYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019Creatures obtain fruits good and ill according to the dispensation of the Ordainer of the\ncreation. Those fruits are inevitable whether I play or not. This is a summons to dice; it is, besides the command of\nthe old king. Although I know that it will prove destructive to me, yet I cannot refuse.\u2019\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dAlthough (a living) animal made of gold was an impossibility, yet Rama suffered\nhimself to be tempted by a (golden) deer. Indeed, the minds of men over whom calamities hang, became deranged\nand out of order. Yudhishthira, therefore, having said these words, retraced his steps along with his brothers. And\nknowing full well the deception practised by Sakuni, the son of Pritha came back to sit at dice with him again. These\nmighty warriors again entered that assembly, afflicting the hearts of all their friends. And compelled by Fate they\nonce more sat down at ease for gambling for the destruction of themselves.\u201d\n\u201cSakuni then said,\u2014\u2019The old king hath given ye back all your wealth. That is well. But, O bull of the Bharata\nrace, listen to me, there is a stake of great value. Either defeated by ye at dice, dressed in deer skins we shall enter\nthe great forest and live there for twelve years passing the whole of the thirteenth year in some inhabited region, un-\nrecognised, and if recognised return to an exile of another twelve years; or vanquished by us, dressed in deer skins\n504 The Mahabharata\nye shall, with Krishna, live for twelve years in the woods passing the whole of the thirteenth year unrecognised, in\nsome inhabited region. If recognised, an exile of another twelve years is to be the consequence. On the expiry of\nthe thirteenth year, each is to have his kingdom surrendered by the other. O Yudhishthira, with this resolution, play\nwith us, O Bharata, casting the dice.\u2019 \u201cAt these words, they that were in that assembly, raising up their arms said in\ngreat anxiety of mind, and from the strength of their feelings these words,\u2014\u2019Alas, fie on the friends of Duryodhana\nthat they do not apprise him of his great danger. Whether he, O bull among the Bharatas, (Dhritarashtra) under-\nstandeth or not, of his own sense, it is thy duty to tell him plainly.\u201d\n\u201cVaisampayana continued,--King Yudhishthira, even hearing these various remarks, from shame and a sense\nof virtue again sat at dice. And though possessed of great intelligence and fully knowing the consequences, he again\nbegan to play, as if knowing that the destruction of the Kurus was at hand.\n\u201cAnd Yudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019How can, O Sakuni, a king like me, always observant of the uses of his own order,\nrefuse, when summoned to dice? Therefore I play with thee.\u201d\n\u201cSakuni answered,\u2014\u2019We have many kine and horses, and milch cows, and an infinite number of goats and\nsheep; and elephants and treasures and gold and slaves both male and female. All these were staked by us before but\nnow let this be our one stake, viz., exile into the woods,--being defeated either ye or we will dwell in the woods (for\ntwelve years) and the thirteenth year, unrecognised, in some inhabited place. Ye bulls among men, with this deter-\nmination, will we play.\u201d\n\u201cO Bharata, this proposal about a stay in the woods was uttered but once. The son of Pritha, however, accepted\nit and Sakuni took up the dice. And casting them he said unto Yudhishthira,\u2014\u2019Lo, I have won.\u201d\nSection LXXVI\nVaisampayana said,\u2014\u201dThen the vanquished sons of Pritha prepared for their exile into the woods. And they,\none after another, in due order, casting off their royal robes, attired themselves in deer-skins. And Dussasana,\nbeholding those chastisers of foes, dressed in deer-skins and deprived of their kingdom and ready to go into exile,\nexclaimed \u2018The absolute sovereignty of the illustrious king Duryodhana hath commenced. The sons of Pandu\nhave been vanquished, and plunged into great affliction. Now have we attained the goal either by broad or narrow\npaths. For today becoming superior to our foes in point of prosperity as also of duration of rule have we become\npraiseworthy of men. The sons of Pritha have all been plunged by us into everlasting hell. They have been deprived\nof happiness and kingdom for ever and ever. They who, proud of their wealth, laughed in derision at the son of\nDhritarashtra, will now have to go into the woods, defeated and deprived by us of all their wealth. Let them now\nput off their variegated coats of mail, their resplendent robes of celestial make, and let them all attire themselves\nin deer-skins according to the stake they had accepted of the son of Suvala. They who always used to boast that\nthey had no equals in all the world, will now know and regard themselves in this their calamity as grains of sesame\nwithout the kernel. Although in this dress of theirs the Pandavas seem like unto wise and powerful persons installed\nin a sacrifice, yet they look like persons not entitled to perform sacrifices, wearing such a guise. The wise Yajnase-\nna of the Somake race, having bestowed his daughter--the princess of Panchala--on the sons of Pandu, acted most\nunfortunately for the husbands of Yajnaseni--these sons of Pritha are as eunuchs. And O Yajnaseni, what joy will\nbe thine upon beholding in the woods these thy husbands dressed in skins and thread-bare rags, deprived of their\nwealth and possessions. Elect thou a husband, whomsoever thou likest, from among all these present here. These\nKurus assembled here, are all forbearing and self-controlled, and possessed of great wealth. Elect thou one amongst\nthese as thy lord, so that these great calamity may not drag thee to wretchedness. \u2018The sons of Pandu now are even\nlike grains of sesame without the kernel, or like show-animals encased in skins, or like grains of rice without the\nkernel. Why shouldst thou then longer wait upon the fallen sons of Pandu? Vain is the labour used upon pressing\nthe sesame grain devoid of the kernel!\u2019\n\u201cThus did Dussasana, the son of Dhritarashtra, utter in the hearing of the Pandavas, harsh words of the most\ncruel import. And hearing them, the unforbearing Bhima, in wrath suddenly approaching that prince like a Hima-\nlayan lion upon a jackal, loudly and chastisingly rebuked him in these words,--Wicked-minded villain, ravest thou\nso in words that are uttered alone by the sinful? Boastest thou thus in the midst of the kings, advanced as thou art\nby the skill of the king of Gandhara. As thou piercest our hearts hear with these thy arrowy words, so shall I pierce\nthy heart in battle, recalling all this to thy mind. And they also who from anger or covetousness are walking behind\nthee as thy protectors,--them also shall I send to the abode of Yama with their descendants and relatives.\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,--Unto Bhima dressed in deer-skins and uttering these words of wrath without doing\nany thing, for he could not deviate from the path of virtue, Dussasana abandoning all sense of shame, dancing\naround the Kurus, loudly said, \u2018O cow! O cow!\u2019\nBhima at this once more said,--Wretch darest thou, O Dussasana, use harsh words as these? Whom doth it\nbehove to boast, thus having won wealth by foul means? I tell thee that if Vrikodara, the son of Pritha, drinketh not\nthy life-blood, piercing open thy breast in battle, let him not attain to regions of blessedness, I tell thee truly that by\n505 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nslaying the sons of Dhritarashtra in battle, before the very eyes of all the warriors, I shall pacify this wrath of mine\nsoon enough.\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dAnd as the Pandavas were going away from the assembly, the wicked king Duryo-\ndhana from excess of joy mimiced by his own steps the playful leonine trade of Bhima. Then Vrikodara, half\nturning towards the king said, Think not ye fool that by this thou gainest any ascendency over me slay thee shall I\nsoon with all thy followers, and answer thee, recalling all this to thy mind. And beholding this insult offered to him,\nthe mighty and proud Bhima, suppressing his rising rage and following the steps of Yudhishthira, also spake these\nwords while going out of the Kaurava court, \u2018I will slay Duryodhana, and Dhananjaya will slay Karna, and Sahadeva\nwill slay Sakuni that gambler with dice. I also repeat in this assembly these proud words which the gods will as-\nsuredly make good, if ever we engage in battle with the Kurus, I will slay this wretched Duryodhana in battle with\nmy mace, and prostrating him on the ground I will place my foot on his head. And as regards this (other) wicked\nperson--Dussasana who is audacious in speech, I will drink his blood like a lion.\n\u201cAnd Arjuna said,--O Bhima, the resolutions of superior men are not known in words only. On the fourteenth\nyear from this day, they shall see what happeneth.\n\u201cAnd Bhima again said,\u2014\u2019The earth shall drink the blood of Duryodhana, and Karna, and the wicked Sakuni,\nand Dussasana that maketh the fourth.\u2019\n\u201cAnd Arjuna said,\u2014\u2019O Bhima, I will, as thou directest, slay in battle this Karna so malicious and jealous and\nharsh-speeched and vain. For doing what is agreeable to Bhima, Arjuna voweth that he will slay in battle with his\narrows this Karna with all his followers. And I will send unto the regions of Yama also all those other kings that will\nfrom foolishness fight against me. The mountains of Himavat might be removed from where they are, the maker\nof the day lose his brightness, the moon his coldness, but this vow of mine will ever be cherished. And all this shall\nassuredly happen if on the fourteenth year from this, Duryodhana doth not, with proper respect, return us our\nkingdom.\u2019\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dAfter Arjuna had said this, Sahadeva the handsome son of Madri, endued with\ngreat energy, desirous of slaying Sakuni, waving his mighty arms and sighing like snake, exclaimed, with eyes red\nwith anger--\u2019Thou disgrace of the Gandhara kings, those whom thou thinkest as defeated are not really so. Those\nare even sharp-pointed arrows from whose wounds thou hast run the risk in battle. I shall certainly accomplish all\nwhich Bhima hath said adverting to thee with all thy followers. If therefore thou hast anything to do, do it before\nthat day cometh. I shall assuredly slay thee in battle with all thy followers soon enough, it thou, O son of Suvala,\nstayest in the light pursuant to the Kshatriya usage.\u2019\n\u201c\u2019Then, O monarch hearing these words of Sahadeva, Nakula the handsomest of men spake these words,\u2014\u2019I\nshall certainly send unto the abode of Yama all those wicked sons of Dhritarashtra, who desirous of death and\nimpelled by Fate, and moved also by the wish of doing what is agreeable to Duryodhana, have used harsh and in-\nsulting speeches towards this daughter o Yajnasena at the gambling match. Soon enough shall I, at the command of\nYudhishthira and remembering the wrongs to Draupadi, make the earth destitute of the sons of Dhritarashtra.\u2019\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dAnd those tigers among men, all endued with long arms, having thus pledged\nthemselves to virtuous promises approached king Dhritarashtra.\u201d\nSection LXXVII\nYudhishthira said,\u2014\u2019I bid farewell unto all the Bharatas, unto my old grand-sire (Bhishma), king Somadatta,\nthe great king Vahlika, Drona, Kripa, all the other kings, Aswathaman, Vidura, Dhritarashtra, all the sons of Dhri-\ntarashtra, Yayutsu, Sanjaya, and all the courtiers, I bid fare well, all of ye and returning again I shall see you.\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dOvercome with shame none of those that were present there, could tell Yud-\nhishthira anything. Within their hearts, however, they prayed for the welfare of that intelligent prince.\nVidura then said,--The reverend Pritha is a princess by birth. It behoveth her not to go into the woods. Delicate\nand old and ever known to happiness the blessed one will live, respected by me, in my abode. Known this, ye sons\nof Pandu. And let safety be always yours.\u2019\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u2019The Pandavas thereupon said,--O sinless one, let it be as thou sayest. Thou art our\nuncle, and, therefore like as our father. We also are all obedient to thee. Thou art, O learned one, our most respected\nsuperior. We should always obey what thou choosest to command. And, O high-souled one, order thou whatever\nelse there is that remaineth to be done.\n\u201cVidura replied,\u2014\u2019O Yudhishthira, O bull of the Bharata race, know this to be my opinion, that one that is\nvanquished by sinful means need not be pained by such defeat. Thou knowest every rule of morality; Dhananjaya is\never victorious in battle; Bhimasena is the slayer of foes; Nakula is the gatherer of wealth; Sahadeva hath adminis-\ntrative talents, Dhaumya is the foremost of all conversant with the vedas; and the well-behaved Draupadi is conver-\nsant with virtue and economy. Ye are attached to one another and feel delight at one another\u2019s sight and enemies can\n506 The Mahabharata\nnot separate you from one another, and ye are contented. Therefore, who is there that will not envy ye? O Bharata,\nthis patient abstraction from the possession of the world will be of great benefit to thee. No foe, even if he were\nequal to sakra himself, will be able to stand it. Formerly thou wert instructed on the mountains of Himavat by Meru\nSavarni; in the town of Varanavata by Krishna Dwaipayana; on the cliff of Bhrigu by Rama; and on the banks of the\nDhrishadwati by Sambhu himself. Thou hast also listened to the instruction of the great Rishi Asita on the hills of\nAnjana; and thou becamest a disciple of Bhrigu on the banks of the Kalmashi. Narada and this thy priest Dhaumya\nwill now become thy instructors. In the matter of the next world, abandon not these excellent lessons thou hast\nobtained from the Rishis. O son of Pandu. thou surpassest in intelligence even Pururavas, the son of Ila; in strength,\nall other monarchs, and in virtue, even the Rishis. Therefore, resolve thou earnestly to win victory, which belongeth\nto Indra; to control thy wrath, which belongeth to Yama; to give in charity, which belongeth to Kuvera; and to con-\ntrol all passions, which belongeth to Varuna. And, O Bharata, obtain thou the power of gladdening from the moon,\nthe power of sustaining all from water; forbearance from the earth; energy from the entire solar disc; strength from\nthe winds, and affluence from the other elements. Welfare and immunity from ailment be thine; I hope to see thee\nreturn. And, O Yudhishthira, act properly and duly in all seasons,--in those of distress--in those of difficulty,--in-\ndeed, in respect of everything, O son of Kunti, with our leave go hence. O Bharata, blessing be thine. No one can say\nthat ye have done anything sinful before. We hope to see thee, therefore, return in safety and crowned with success.\u201d\nVaisampayana continued,\u2014\u201dThus addressed by Vidura, Yudhishthira the son of Pandu, of prowess incapable of\nbeing baffled, saying, \u2018So be it,\u2019 bowing low unto Bhishma and Drona, went away.\u201d\nBook 6\nBattle of Kurukshetra: Bhishma\nSection CXVI\nDhritarashtra said, \u201cHow, O Sanjaya, did Santanu\u2019s son Bhishma of mighty energy fight on the tenth day of bat-\ntle, with the Pandavas and the Srinjayas? How also did the Kurus resist the Pandavas in battle? Describe to me the\ngreat battle fought by Bhishma, that ornament of battle.\u201d\nSanjaya said, \u201cI will presently describe to thee, O Bharata, how the Kauravas fought with the Pandavas, and how\nthat battle took place. Day after day many mighty car-warriors of thy army, excited with wrath, were despatched to\nthe other world by the diadem-decked (Arjuna) with his great weapons. The ever-victorious Kuru warrior Bhish-\nma also, agreeably to his vow, always caused a great carnage among the Partha army. O chastiser of foes, beholding\nBhishma, fighting at the head of the Kurus, and Arjuna also fighting at the head of the Panchalas, we could not say\ntruly on which side the victory would declare itself. On the tenth day of battle, when Bhishma and Arjuna en-\ncountered each other, awful was the carnage that took place. On that day, O scorcher of foes, Santanu\u2019s son, Bhish-\nma, conversant with high and mighty weapons, repeatedly slew thousands upon thousands of warriors. Many, O\nBharata, whose names and families were not known, but who, endued with great bravery, were unretreating from\nbattle, were on that day slain by Bhishma. Scorching the Pandava army for ten days, Bhishma of virtuous soul, gave\nup all desire of protecting his life. Wishing his own slaughter presently at the head of his troops,--No more shall I\nslay large numbers of foremost of warriors.--thought thy mighty-armed sire Devavrata. And seeing Yudhishthira\nnear him, O king, he addressed him, saying, \u2018O Yudhishthira, O thou of great wisdom, O thou that art acquainted\nwith every branch of learning, listen to these righteous and heaven-leading words, O sire, that I say. O Bharata, I\nno longer desire to protect, O sire, this body of mine. I have passed much time in slaying large numbers of men in\nbattle. If thou wishest to do what is agreeable to me, strive to slay me, placing Partha with the Panchalas and the\nSrinjayas at thy van\u2019. Ascertaining this to be his intention, king Yudhishthira of true sight proceeded to battle with\nthe Srinjayas (for his support). Then Dhrishtadyumna, O king, and Pandu\u2019s son Yudhishthira, having heard those\nwords of Bhishma urged their array on. And Yudhishthira said, \u2018Advance! Fight! Vanquish Bhishma in battle. Ye\nall will be protected by that conqueror of foes, viz., Jishnu of unbaffled aim. And this great bowman, this genera-\nlissimo (of our forces), viz., the son of Prishata, as also Bhima, will assuredly protect you. Ye Srinjayas, entertain\nno fear today of Bhishma in battle. Without doubt, we will vanquish Bhishma today, placing Sikhandin in our van\u2019.\nHaving, on the tenth day of battle, made such a vow, the Pandavas, resolved to (conquer or) go to heaven, advanced,\nblinded by rage, with Sikhandin and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu to the fore. And they made the most vigorous\nefforts for the overthrow of Bhishma. Then diverse kings, of great might, urged by thy son, and accompanied by\nDrona and his son and a large force, and the mighty Dussasana at the head of all his uterine brothers, proceeded\ntowards Bhishma staying in the midst of that battle. Then those brave warriors of thy army, placing Bhishma of high\nvows in their van, battled with the Parthas headed by Sikhandin. Supported by the Chedis and the Panchalas, the\nape-bannered Arjuna, placing Sikhandin ahead, proceeded towards Bhishma, the son of Santanu. And the grand-\nson of Sini battled with Drona\u2019s son, and Dhrishtaketu with the descendant of Puru, and Yudhamanyu with thy son\n507 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nDuryodhana at the head of his followers. And Virata, at the head of his forces, encountered Jayadratha supported by\nhis own troops. And Vardhakshatra\u2019s heir, O chastiser of foes, encountered thy son Chitrasena armed with excellent\nbow and arrows. 1 And Yudhishthira proceeded against the mighty bowman Salya at the head of his troops. And\nBhimasena, well-protected, proceeded against the elephant-division (of the Kaurava army). And Dhrishtadyumna,\nthe prince of Panchala, excited with fury and accompanied by his brothers, proceeded against Drona, that foremost\nof all wielders of weapons, invincible, and irresistible. That chastiser of foes, viz., prince Vrihadvala, bearing on his\nstandard the device of the lion, proceeded against Subhadra\u2019s son whose standard bore the device of the Karnika-\nra flower. Thy sons, accompanied by many kings, proceeded against Sikhandin and Dhananjaya the son of Pritha,\nfrom desire of slaughtering both of them. When the combatants of both armies rushed against each other with aw-\nful prowess, the earth shook (under their tread). Beholding Santanu\u2019s son in battle, the divisions of thy army and of\nthe foe, O Bharata, became mingled with one another. Tremendous was the din, O Bharata, that arose there of those\nwarriors burning with rage and rushing against each other. And it was heard on all sides, O king. With the blare of\nconchs and the leonine shouts of the soldiers, the uproar became awful. The splendour, equal to that of either the\nSun or the Moon, of bracelets and diadems of all the heroic kings, became dimmed. And the dust that rose looked\nlike a cloud, the flash of bright weapons constituting its lightning. And the twang of bows, the whiz of arrows, the\nblare of conchs, the loud beat of drums, and the rattle of cars, of both the armies, constituted the fierce roar of those\nclouds. And the welkin, over the field of battle, in consequence of the bearded darts, the javelins, the swords and\nshowers of arrows of both armies, was darkened. And car-warriors, and horsemen felled horsemen, in that dread-\nful battle. And elephants killed elephants, and foot-soldiers slew foot-soldiers. And the battle that took place there\nfor Bhishma\u2019s sake, between the Kurus and the Pandavas, O tiger among men, was fierce in the extreme, like that\nbetween two hawks for a piece of flesh. Engaged in battle, that encounter between those combatants desirous of\nslaughtering and vanquishing one another, was extremely dreadful.\u201d\nSection CXVII\nSanjaya said, \u201cAbhimanyu, O king, displaying his prowess for the sake of Bhishma, fought with thy son who\nwas supported by a large force. Then Duryodhana, excited with wrath, struck Abhimanyu in the chest with rune\nstraight arrows, and once more with three. Then in that battle, Arjuna\u2019s son, inflamed with wrath, hurled at Duryo-\ndhana\u2019s car a terrible dart resembling the rod of Death himself. Thy son, however, that mighty car-warrior, O king,\nwith a broad-headed arrow of great sharpness, cut off in twain that dart of terrible force coursing towards him with\ngreat speed. Beholding that dart of his drop down on the earth, Arjuna\u2019s wrathful son pierced Duryodhana with\nthree shafts in his arms and chest. And once more, O Chief of the Bharatas, that mighty car-warrior of Bharata\u2019s\nrace struck the Kuru king with ten fierce shafts in the centre of his chest. And the battle, O Bharata, that took place\nbetween those two heroes, viz., Subhadra\u2019s son, and that bull of Kuru\u2019s race, the former fighting for compassing\nBhishma\u2019s death and the latter for Arjuna\u2019s defeat, was fierce and interesting to behold, and gratifying to the senses,\nand was applauded by all the kings. That bull among Brahmanas and chastiser of foes, viz., the son of Drona, ex-\ncited with wrath in that battle, forcibly struck Satyaki in the chest with fierce arrow. The grandson of Sini also, that\nhero of immeasurable soul, struck the preceptor\u2019s son in every vital limbs with nine shafts winged with the feathers\nof the Kanka bird. Aswatthaman then, in that battle, struck Satyaki (in return) with nine shafts, and once more,\nquickly, with thirty, in his arms and chest. Then that great bowman Of the Satwata race, possessed of great fame,\ndeeply pierced by Drona\u2019s son, pierced the latter (in return) with arrows. The mighty car-warrior Paurava, covering\nDhrishtaketu in that battle with his shafts, mangled that great bowman exceedingly. The mighty car-warrior Dhr-\nishtaketu, endued with great strength, quickly pierced the former with thirty arrows. Then the mighty car-warrior\nPaurava cut off Dhrishtaketu\u2019s bow, and uttering a loud shout, pierced him with whetted shafts. Dhrishtaketu then\ntaking up another bow, pierced Paurava, O king, with three and seventy shafts of great sharpness. Those two great\nbowmen and mighty car-warriors, both of gigantic stature, pierced each other with showers of arrows. Each suc-\nceeded in cutting off the other\u2019s bow, and each slew the other\u2019s steeds. And both of them, thus deprived of their cars,\nthen encountered each other in a battle with swords. And each took up a beautiful shield made of bull\u2019s hide and\ndocked with a hundred moons and graced with a hundred stars. And each of them also took up a polished sword\nof brilliant lustre. And thus equipt, they rushed, O king at each other, like two lions in the deep forest, both seeking\nthe companionship of the same lioness in her season. They wheeled in beautiful circles, advanced and retreated, and\ndisplayed other movements, seeking to strike each other. Then Paurava, excited with wrath, addressed Dhrishta-\nketu, saying--Wait, Wait,--and struck him on the frontal bone with that large scimitar of his. The king of the Chedis\nalso, in that battle, struck Paurava, that bull among men, on his shoulder-joint, with his large scimitar of sharp edge.\nThose two repressors of foes thus encountering each other in dreadful battle and thus striking each other, O king,\nboth fell down on the field. Then thy son Jayatsena, taking Paurava up on his car, removed him from the field of\nbattle on that vehicle. And as regards Dhrishtaketu, the valiant and heroic Sahadeva, the son of Madri, possessed of\n508 The Mahabharata\ngreat prowess, bore him away from the field.\n\u201cChitrasena, having pierced Susarman with many arrows made wholly of iron, once more pierced him with\nsixty arrows and once more with nine. Susarman, however, excited with wrath in battle, pierced thy son, O king,\nwith hundreds of arrows. Chitrasena then, O monarch, excited with rage, pierced his adversary with thirty straight\nshafts. Susarman, however, pierced Chitrasena again in return.\n\u201cIn that battle for the destruction of Bhishma, Subhadra\u2019s son, enhancing his fame and honour, fought with\nprince Vrihadvala, putting forth his prowess for aiding (his sire) Partha and then proceeded towards Bhishma\u2019s\nfront. The ruler of the Kosalas, having pierced the son of Arjuna with five shafts made of iron, once more pierced\nhim with twenty straight shafts. Then the son of Subhadra pierced the ruler of Kosalas with eight shafts made whol-\nly of iron. He succeeded not, however, in making the ruler of the Kosalas to tremble, and, therefore, he once more\npierced him with many arrows. And Phalguni\u2019s son then cut off Vrihadvala\u2019s bow, and struck him again with thirty\narrows winged with feathers of the Kanka bird. Prince Vrihadvala then, taking up another bow, angrily pierced the\nson of Phalguni in that battle with many arrows. Verily, O scorcher of foes, the battle, for Bhishma\u2019s sake, that took\nplace between them, both excited with rage and both conversant with every mode of fight, was like the encounter of\nVali and Vasava in days of old on the occasion of the battle between the gods and the Asuras.\n\u201cBhimasena, fighting against the elephant-division, looked highly resplendent like Sakra armed with the\nthunder after splitting large mountains. 1 Indeed, elephants, huge as hills, slaughtered by Bhimasena in battle, fell\ndown in numbers on the field, filling the earth with their shrieks. Resembling massive heaps of antimony, and of\nmountain-like proportions, those elephants with frontal globes split open, lying prostrate on the earth, seemed like\nmountains strewn over the earth\u2019s surface. The mighty bowman Yudhishthira, protected by a large force, afflicted\nthe ruler of the Madras, encountering him in that dreadful battle. The ruler of the Madras, in return, displaying\nhis prowess for the sake of Bhishma, afflicted the son of Dharma, that mighty car-warrior, in battle. The king of\nSindhus, having pierced Virata with nine straight arrows of keen points, once more struck him with thirty. Virata,\nhowever, O king, that commander of a large division, struck Jayadratha in the centre of his chest with thirty shafts\nof keen points. The ruler of the Matsyas and the ruler of the Sindhus, both armed with beautiful bows and beauti-\nful scimitars, both decked with handsome coats of mail and weapons and standards, and both of beautiful forms\nlooked resplendent in that battle.\n\u201cDrona, encountering Dhrishtadyumna the prince of the Panchalas in dreadful battle, fought fiercely with his\nstraight shafts. Then Drona, O king, having cut off the large bow of Prishata\u2019s son, pierced him deeply with fifty\narrows. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the son of Prishata, taking up another bow, sped at Drona who was\ncontending with him, many arrows. The mighty car-warrior Drona however, cut off all those arrows, striking them\nwith his own. And then Drona sped at Drupada\u2019s son five fierce shafts. Then that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the\nson of Prishata, excited with rage, hurled at Drona in that battle a mace resembling the rod of Death himself. Drona\nhowever, with fifty arrows checked that mace decked with gold as it coursed impetuously towards him. Thereupon\nthat mace, cut into fragments, O king, by those shafts shot from Drona\u2019s bow, fell down on the earth. Then that\nscorcher of foes, viz., the son of Prishata, beholding his mace baffled, hurled at Drona an excellent dart made wholly\nof iron. Drona, however, O Bharata, cut that dart with nine shafts in that battle and then afflicted that great bow-\nman, viz., the son of Prishata. Thus took place, O king, that fierce and awful battle between Drona and the son of\nPrishata, for the sake of Bhishma.\n\u201cArjuna, getting at the son of Ganga, afflicted him with many arrows of keen points, and rushed at him like an\ninfuriate elephant in the forest upon another. King Bhagadatta, however, of great prowess then rushed at Arjuna,\nand checked his course in battle with showers of arrows. Arjuna then, in that dreadful battle, pierced Bhagadatta\u2019s\nelephant coming towards him, with many polished arrows of iron, that were all bright as silver and furnished with\nkeen points. The son of Kunti, meanwhile, O king, urged Sikhandin, saying,--Proceed, proceed, towards Bhishma,\nand slay him!--Then, O elder brother of Pandu, the ruler of Pragjyotishas, abandoning that son of Pandu, quickly\nproceeded, O king, against the car of Drupada. Then Arjuna, O monarch, speedily proceeded towards Bhishma,\nplacing Sikhandin ahead. And then there took place a fierce battle, for all the brave combatants of thy army rushed\nwith great vigour against Arjuna, uttering loud shouts. And all this seemed extremely wonderful. Like the wind\ndispersing in the summer masses of clouds in the welkin, Arjuna dispersed, O king, all those diverse divisions of\nthy sons. Sikhandin, however, without any anxiety, coming up at the grandsire of the Bharatas, quickly pierced him\nwith great many arrows. As regards Bhishma, his car was then his fire-chamber. His bow was the flame of that fire.\nAnd swords I and darts and maces constituted the fuel of that fire. And the showers of arrows he shot were the\nblazing sparks of that fire with which he was then consuming Kshatriyas in that battle. As a raging conflagration\nwith constant supply of fuel, wandereth amid masses of dry grass when aided by the wind, so did Bhishma blaze up\nwith his flames, scattering his celestial weapons. And the Kuru hero slew the Somakas that followed Partha in that\nbattle. Indeed that mighty car-warrior checked also the other forces of Arjuna, by means of his straight and whetted\nshafts furnished with wings of gold. Filling in that dreadful battle all the points of the compass, cardinal and sub-\n509 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nsidiary, with his leonine shouts, Bhishma felled many car-warriors, O king, (from their cars) and many steeds along\nwith their riders. And he caused large bodies of cars to look like forests of palmyras shorn of their leafy heads. That\nforemost of all wielders of weapons, in that battle, deprived cars and steeds and elephants, of their riders. Hearing\nthe twang of his bow and the slap of his palms, both resembling the roll of the thunder, the troops, O king, trembled\nall over the field. The shafts, O chief of men, of thy sire were never bootless as they fell. Indeed, shot from Bhishma\u2019s\nbow they never fell only touching the bodies of the foe (but pierced them through in every case). We saw crowds\nof cars, O king, deprived of riders, but unto which were yoked fleet steeds, dragged on all sides with the speed of\nthe wind. Full fourteen thousand great car-warriors of noble parentage, prepared to lay down their lives, unretreat-\ning and brave, and possessed of standards decked with gold, belonging to the Chedis, the Kasis, and the Karushas,\napproaching Bhishma, that hero who resembled the Destroyer himself with wide-open mouth, were despatched\nto the other world, with their steeds, cars and elephants. There was not, O king, a single great car-warrior among\nthe Somakas, who, having approached Bhishma in that battle, returned with life from that engagement. Beholding\nBhishma\u2019s prowess, people regarded all those warriors (who approached him) as already despatched to the abode of\nthe king of the Dead. Indeed, no car-warrior ventured to approach Bhishma in battle, except the heroic Arjuna hav-\ning white steeds (yoked unto his car) and owning Krishna for his charioteer, and Sikhandin, the prince of Panchala,\nof immeasurable energy.\u201d\nSection CXVIII\nSanjaya said,--Sikhandin, O bull among men, approaching Bhishma in battle, struck him in the centre of the\nchest with ten broad-headed arrows The son of Ganga, however, O Bharata, only looked at Sikhandin with wrath\nand as if consuming the Panchala prince with that look. Remembering his femininity, O king, Bhishma, in the very\nsight of all, struck him not. Sikhandin, however, understood it not. Then Arjuna, O monarch, addressed Sikhandin,\nsaying,\u2014\u2019Rush quickly and slay the grandsire. What needst thou say, O hero? Slay the mighty car-warrior Bhishma.\nI do not see any other warrior in Yudhishthira\u2019s army who is competent to fight with Bhishma in battle, save thee,\nO tiger among men. I say this truly.\u2019 Thus addressed by Partha, Sikhandin, O bull of Bharata\u2019s race, quickly covered\nthe grandsire with diverse kinds of weapons. Disregarding those shafts, thy sire Devavrata began, with his shafts,\nto check the angry Arjuna only in that battle. And that mighty car-warrior, O sire, began also to despatch, with his\nshafts of keen points, the whole army of the Pandavas to the other world. The Pandavas also, O king, after the same\nmanner, supported by their vast host, began to overwhelm Bhishma like the clouds covering the maker of day. O\nbull of Bharata\u2019s race, surrounded on all sides, that Bharata hero consumed many brave warriors in that battle like a\nraging conflagration in the forest (consuming numberless trees). The prowess that we then beheld there of thy son\n(Dussasana) was wonderful, inasmuch as he battled with Partha and protected the grandsire at the same time. With\nthat feat of thy son Dussasana, that illustrious bowman, all the people there were highly gratified. Alone he battled\nwith all the Pandavas having Arjuna amongst them; and he fought with such vigour that the Pandavas were unable\nto resist him. Many car-warriors were in that battle deprived of their cars by Dussasana. And many mighty bowmen\non horseback and many mighty-warriors, elephants, pierced with Dussasana\u2019s keen shafts, fell down on the earth.\nAnd many elephants, afflicted with his shafts, ran away in all directions. As a fire fiercely blazeth forth with bright\nflames when fed with fuel, so did thy son blaze forth, consuming the Pandava host. And no car-warrior, O Bharata,\nof the Pandava host ventured to vanquish or even proceed against that warrior of gigantic proportions, save Indra\u2019s\nson (Arjuna) owning white steeds and having Krishna for his charioteer. Then Arjuna also called Vijaya, vanquish-\ning Dussasana in battle, O king, in the very sight of all the troops, proceeded against Bhishma. Though vanquished,\nthy son, however, relying upon the might of Bhishma\u2019s arms, repeatedly comforted his own side and battled with\nthe Pandavas with great fierceness. Arjuna, O king, fighting with his foes in that battle, looked exceedingly resplen-\ndent. 1 Then Sikhandin, in that battle, O king, pierced the grandsire with many arrows whose touch resembled that\nof the bolts of heaven and which were as fatal as the poison of the snake. These arrows, however, O monarch, caused\nthy sire little pain, for the son of Ganga received them laughingly. Indeed, as a person afflicted with heat cheerful-\nly receives torrents of rain, even so did the son of Ganga received those arrows of Sikhandin. And the Kshatriyas\nthere, O king, beheld Bhishma in that great battle as a being of fierce visage who was incessantly consuming the\ntroops of the high-souled Pandavas.\n\u201cThen thy son (Duryodhana), addressing all his warriors, said unto them, \u2018Rush ye against Phalguni from all\nsides. Bhishma, acquainted with the duties of a commander, will protect you\u2019. Thus addressed, the Kaurava troops\ncasting off all fear, fought with the Pandavas. (And once more, Duryodhana said unto them). \u2018With his tall standard\nbearing the device of the golden palmyra, Bhishma stayeth, protecting the honour and the armour of all the Dhar-\ntarashtra warriors. The very gods, striving vigorously, cannot vanquish the illustrious and mighty Bhishma. What\nneed be said, therefore, of the Parthas who are mortals? Therefore, ye warriors, fly not away from the field, getting\nPhalguni for a foe. I myself, striving vigorously, will today fight with the Pandavas.. uniting with all of you, ye lords\n510 The Mahabharata\nof earth, exerting yourselves actively.\u2019 Hearing these words, O monarch, of thy son with bow in hand, many mighty\ncombatants, excited with rage, belonging to the Videhas, the Kalingas, and the diverse tribes of the Daserkas, fell\nupon Phalguni. And many combatants also, belonging to the Nishadas, the Sauviras, the Valhikas, the Daradas,\nthe Westerners, the Northerners, the Malavas, the Abhighatas, the Surasenas, the Sivis, the Vasatis, the Salwas, the\nSakas, the Trigartas, the Amvashthas, and the Kekayas, similarly fell upon Partha, like flights of insects upon a fire.\nThe mighty Dhananjaya, otherwise called Vibhatsu, then, O monarch, calling to mind diverse celestial weapons and\naiming them at those great car-warriors at the heads of their respective divisions, 1 quickly consumed them all, by\nmeans of those weapons of great force, like fire consuming a flight of insects. And while that firm bowman was (by\nmeans of his celestial weapons) creating thousands upon thousands of arrows, his Gandiva looked highly resplen-\ndent in the welkin. Then those Kshatriyas, O monarch, afflicted with those arrows with their tall standards torn\nand overthrown, could not even together, approach the ape-bannered (Partha). Car-warriors fell down with their\nstandards, and horsemen with their horses, and elephant-riders with their elephants, attacked by Kiritin with his\nshafts. And the earth was soon covered all on all sides with the retreating troops of those kings, routed in conse-\nquence of the shafts shot from Arjuna\u2019s arms. Partha then, O monarch, having routed the Kaurava army, sped many\narrows at Dussasana. Those arrows with iron heads, piercing thy son Dussasana through, all entered the earth like\nsnakes through ant-hills. Arjuna then slew Dussasana\u2019s steeds and then felled his charioteer. And the lord Arjuna,\nwith twenty shafts, deprived Vivingsati of his car, and struck him five straight shafts. And piercing Kripa and Vikar-\nna and Salya with many arrows made wholly of iron, Kunti\u2019s son owning white steeds deprived all of them of their\ncars. Thus deprived of their cars and vanquished in battle by Savyasachin, Kripa and Salya, O sire, and Dussasana,\nand Vikarna and Vivingsati, all fled away. Having vanquished those mighty car-warriors, O chief of the Bharatas,\nin the forenoon, Partha blazed up in that battle like a smokeless conflagration. Scattering his shafts all around like\nthe Sun shedding rays of light, Partha felled many other kings, O monarch. Making those mighty car-warriors turn\ntheir backs upon the field by means of his arrowy showers, Arjuna caused a large river of bloody current to flow in\nthat battle between the hosts of the Kurus and the Pandavas, O Bharata. Large numbers of elephants and steeds and\ncar-warriors were slain by car-warriors. And many were the car-warriors slain by elephants, and many also were\nthe steeds slain by foot-soldiers. And the bodies of many elephant-riders and horsemen and car-warriors, cut off in\nthe middle, as also their heads, fell down on every part of the field. And the field of battle, O king, was strewn with\n(slain) princes,--mighty car-warriors,--falling or fallen, decked with ear-rings and bracelets. And it was also strewn\nwith the bodies of many warriors cut off by car-wheels, or trodden down by elephants. And foot-soldiers ran away,\nand horsemen also with their horses. And many elephants and car-warriors fell down on all sides. And many cars,\nwith wheels and yokes and standards broken, lay scattered all about on the field. And the field of battle, dyed with\nthe gore of large numbers of elephants, steeds, and car-warriors, looked beautiful like a red cloud, in the autumnal\nsky. Dogs, and crows, and vultures, and wolves, and jackals, and many other frightful beasts and birds, set up loud\nhowls, at the sight of the food that lay before them. Diverse kinds of winds blew along all directions. And Rakshasas\nand evil spirits were seen there, uttering loud roars. And strings, embroidered with gold, and costly banners, were\nseen to wave, moved by the wind. And thousands of umbrellas and great cars with standards attached to them, were\nseen lying scattered about on the field. Then Bhishma, O king, invoking a celestial weapon, rushed at the son of\nKunti, in the very sight of all the bowmen. Thereupon Sikhandin, clad in mail, rushed at Bhishma who was dashing\ntowards Arjuna. At this, Bhishma withdrew that weapon resembling fire (in effulgence and energy). Meanwhile\nKunti\u2019s son owning white steeds slaughtered thy troops, confounding the grandsire.\u201d\nSection CXIX\nSanjaya said, \u201cWhen the combatants of both armies, strong in number, were thus disposed in battle array, all\nthose unretreating heroes, O Bharata, set their heart upon the region of Brahma. 1 In course of the general engage-\nment that followed, the same class of combatants did not fight with the same class of combatants. Car-warriors\nfought not with car-warriors, or foot-soldiers with foot-soldiers, or horsemen with horsemen, or elephant-warriors\nwith elephant-warriors. On the other hand, O monarch, the combatants fought with one another like mad men.\nGreat and dreadful was the calamity that overtook both the armies. In that fierce slaughter when elephants and men\nspread themselves on the field, all distinctions between them ceased, for they fought indiscriminately.\n\u201cThen Salya and Kripa, and Chitrasena, O Bharata, and Dussasana, and Vikarna, those heroes mounted on\ntheir bright cars, caused the Pandava host to tremble. Slaughtered in battle by those high-souled warriors, the\nPandava army began to reel in diverse ways, O king, like a boat on the waters tossed by the wind. As the wintry cold\ncuts kine to the quick, so did Bhishma cut the sons of Pandu to the quick. As regards thy army also, many elephants,\nlooking like newly-risen clouds, were felled by the illustrious Partha. And many foremost of warriors too were seen\nto be crushed by that hero. And struck with arrows and long shafts in thousands, many huge elephants fell down,\nuttering frightful shrieks of pain. And the field of battle looked beautiful, strewn with the bodies, still decked with\n511 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nornaments of high-souled warriors deprived of life and with heads still decked with ear-rings. And in that battle, O\nking, which was destructive of great heroes, when Bhishma and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu put forth their prow-\ness, thy sons, O monarch, beholding the grandsire exert himself vigorously, approached him, with all their troops\nplaced ahead. Desirous of laying down their lives in battle and making heaven itself their goal, they approached the\nPandavas in that battle, which was fraught with great carnage. The brave Pandavas also, O king, bearing in mind the\nmany injuries of diverse kinds inflicted upon them before by thee and thy son, O monarch, and casting off all fear,\nand eager to win the highest heavens, cheerfully fought with thy son and the other warriors of thy army.\n\u201cThen the generalissimo of the Pandava army, viz., the mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna, addressing his\nsoldiers, said, \u2018Ye Somakas, accompanied by the Srinjayas, rush ye at Ganga\u2019s son.\u2019 Hearing those words of their\ncommander the Somakas and the Srinjayas, though afflicted with showers of arrows, rushed at the son of Ganga.\nThus attacked, O king, thy sire Bhishma, influenced by wrath, began to fight with the Srinjayas. In days of old, O\nsire, the intelligent Rama had imparted to Bhishma of glorious achievements that instruction in weapons which\nwas so destructive of hostile ranks. Relying on that instruction and causing a great havoc among the troops of the\nfoe, that slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the old Kuru grandsire Bhishma, day after day, slew ten thousand warriors of\nthe Ratha. On the tenth day, however, O bull of Bharata\u2019s race, Bhishma, single-handed, slew ten thousand ele-\nphants. And then he slew seven great car-warriors among the Matsyas and the Panchalas. In addition to all this,\nin that dreadful battle five thousand foot-soldiers, and one thousand tuskers, and ten thousand steeds, were also\nslain by thy sire, O king, through skill acquired by education. Then having thinned the ranks of all the kings, he\nslew Satanika, the dear brother of Virata. And the valiant Bhishma, having slain Satanika in battle, felled, O king,\nfull one thousand Kshatriyas with his broad-headed shafts. Besides these, all the Kshatriyas of the Pandava army\nwho followed Dhananjaya, as soon as they approached Bhishma, had to go to Yama\u2019s abode. Covering the Pandava\nhost from every side with showers of arrows, Bhishma stayed in battle at the head of the Kaurava army. Achieving\nthe most glorious feats on the tenth day, as he stayed between the two armies, bow in hand, none of the kings, O\nmonarch, could even look at him, for he then resembled the hot mid-day Sun in the summer sky. As Sakra scorched\nthe Daitya host in battle, even so, O Bharata, did Bhishma scorch the Pandava host. Beholding him thus put forth\nhis prowess, the slayer of Madhu, viz., the son of Devaki, cheerfully addressing Dhananjaya, said, \u2018There, Bhish-\nma, the son of Santanu, stayeth between the two armies. Slaying him by putting forth thy might, thou mayst win\nvictory. There, at that spot, whence he breaketh our ranks, check him, putting forth thy strength. O lord, none else,\nsave thee, ventureth to bear the arrows of Bhishma. Thus urged, the ape-bannered Arjuna at that moment made\nBhishma with his car, steeds, and standard, invisible by means of his arrows. That bull, however, among the fore-\nmost of Kurus, by means of his own arrowy showers, pierced those showers of shafts shot by the son of Pandu. Then\nthe king of the Panchalas the valiant Dhrishtaketu, Bhimasena the son of Pandu, Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata\u2019s\nrace, the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva), Chekitana, and the five Kaikaya brothers, and the mighty-armed Satyaki\nand Subhadra\u2019s son, and Ghatotkacha, and the (five) sons of Draupadi, and Sikhandin, and the valiant Kuntibhoja,\nand Susarman, and Virata, these and many other powerful warriors of the Pandava army, afflicted by the shafts of\nBhishma, seemed to sink in an ocean of grief, Phalguni, however, rescued them all. Then Sikhandin, taking up a\nmighty weapon and protected by Kiritin, rushed impetuously towards Bhishma alone. The unvanquished Vibhatsu\nthen, knowing what should be done after what, slew all those that followed Bhishma, and then himself rushed at\nhim. And Satyaki, and Chekitana, and Dhristadyumna of Prishata\u2019s race, and Virata, and Drupada, and the twin\nsons of Madri by Pandu, all protected by that firm bowman (viz., Arjuna) rushed against Bhishma alone in that\nbattle. And Abhimanyu, and the five sons of Draupadi also, with mighty weapons upraised, rushed against Bhish-\nma in battle. All those firm bowmen, unretreating from battle, pierced Bhishma in diverse parts of his body with\nwell-aimed shafts. Disregarding all those shafts, large in number, shot by those foremost of princes belonging to the\nPandava host, Bhishma of undepressed soul penetrated into the Pandava ranks. And the grandsire baffled all those\narrows, as if sporting the while. Frequently looking at Sikhandin the prince of the Panchalas with a laugh, he aimed\nnot a single arrow at him, recollecting his femininity. On the other hand, he slew seven great car-warriors belonging\nto Drupada\u2019s division. Then confused cries of woe soon arose amongst the Matsyas, the Panchalas, and the Chedis,\nwho were together rushing at that single hero. With large numbers of foot-soldiers and steeds and cars, and with\nshowers of arrows, O scorcher of foes, they overwhelmed that single warrior, viz., Bhishma the son of Bhagirathi,\nthat scorcher of foes, like the clouds overwhelming the maker of day. Then in that battle between him and them,\nwhich resembled the battle between the gods and the Asuras in days of old, the diadem-decked (Arjuna), placing\nSikhandin before him, pierced Bhishma (repeatedly).\u2019\nSection CXX\nSanjaya said, \u201cThus all the Pandavas, placing Sikhandin before them pierced Bhishma in that battle repeatedly\nsurrounding him on all sides. And all the Srinjayas, uniting together, struck him with dreadful Sataghnis, and\n512 The Mahabharata\nspiked maces, and battle-axes, and mallets, and short thick clubs, and bearded darts, and other missiles, and arrows\nfurnished with golden wing, and darts and lances and kampanas; and with long shafts, and arrows furnished with\nheads shaped like the calf-tooth, and rockets. Thus afflicted by many, his coat of mail was pierced everywhere. But\nthough pierced in every vital part, Bhishma felt no pain. On the other hand, he then seemed to his enemies to\nresemble in appearance the (all-destructive) fire that rises at the end of Yuga. His bow and arrows constituted the\nblazing flames (of that fire). The flight of his weapons constituted its (friendly) breeze. The rattle of his car-wheels\nconstituted its heat and mighty weapons constituted its splendour. His beautiful bow formed its fierce tongue, and\nthe bodies of heroic warriors, its profuse fuel. And Bhishma was seen to roll through the midst of crowds of cars\nbelonging to those kings, or to come out (of the press) at times, or course once more through their midst. Then,\ndisregarding the king of the Panchalas and Dhrishtaketu, he penetrated, O monarch, into the midst of the Pandava\narmy. He then pierced the six Pandava warriors, viz., Satyaki, and Bhima, and Dhananjaya the son of Pandu, and\nDrupada, and Virata, and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata\u2019s race, with many excellent arrows of great sharpness and\ndreadful whizz and exceeding impetuosity, and capable of piercing through every kind of armour. Those mighty\ncar-warriors, however, checking those keen shafts, afflicted Bhishma with great force, each of them striking him\nwith ten shafts. Those mighty shafts, whetted on stone and furnished with golden wings, which the great car-war-\nrior Sikhandin shot, quickly penetrated into Bhishma\u2019s body. Then the diadem-decked (Arjuna), excited with wrath,\nand placing Sikhandin ahead rushed at Bhishma and cut off the latter\u2019s bow. Thereupon mighty car-warriors, seven\nin number, viz., Drona and Kritavarman, and Jayadratha the ruler of the Sindhus, and Bhurisravas, and Sala, and\nSalya, and Bhagadatta could not brook that act of Arjuna. Inflamed with rage, they rushed at him. Indeed, those\nmighty car-warriors, invoking into existence celestial weapons, fell with great wrath upon that son of Pandu, and\ncovered him with their arrows. And as they rushed towards Phalguni\u2019s car, the noise made by them was heard to\nresemble that made by the ocean itself when it swelleth in rage at the end of the Yuga, Kill, Bring up (our forces),\nTake, Pierce, Cut off, this was the furious uproar heard about Phalguni\u2019s car. Hearing that furious uproar, the mighty\ncar-warriors of the Pandava army rushed forward, O bull of Bharata\u2019s race, for protecting Arjuna. They were\nSatyaki, and Bhimasena, and Dhrishtadyumna of Prishata\u2019s race, and both Virata and Drupada, and the Rakshasa\nGhatotkacha, and the wrathful Abhimanyu. These seven, inflamed with rage, and armed with excellent bows,\nrushed with great speed. And the battle that took place between these and the Kaurava warriors was fierce, making\nthe hair stand on end, and resembling O chief of the Bharatas, the battle of the gods with the Danavas. Sikhandin,\nhowever, that foremost of car-warriors, protected in the battle by the diadem-decked (Arjuna), pierced Bhishma, in\nthat encounter, with ten shafts after the latter\u2019s bow had been cut off. And he struck Bhishma\u2019s charioteer with other\nshafts, and cut off the latter\u2019s standard with one shaft. Then the son of Ganga took up another bow that was tougher.\nThat even was cut off by Phalguni with three sharp shafts. Indeed, that chastiser of foes, viz., Arjuna, who was\ncapable of drawing the bow with even his left hand, excited with rage, one after another, cut off all the bows that\nBhishma took up. Then Bhishma, whose bows were thus cut off, excited with rage, and licking the corners of his\nmouth, took up a dart that was capable of riving a hill. In rage he hurled it at Phalguni\u2019s car. Beholding its course\ntowards him like the blazing bolt of heaven, the delighter of the Pandavas fixed five sharp broad-headed arrows (on\nhis bow-string). And with those five arrows, O chief of the Bharatas, the angry Arjuna cut off into five fragments\nthat dart hurled from Bhishma\u2019s arms. Thus cut off by the angry Arjuna, that dart then fell down like a flash of\nlightning separated from a mass of clouds. Beholding his dart cut off, Bhishma became filled with rage. That hero,\nthat subjugator of hostile cities, then began to reflect. And he said unto himself, \u2018With only a single bow I could slay\nall the Pandavas, if the mighty Vishnu himself had not been their protector. For two reasons, however, I will not\nfight with the Pandavas, viz., their unslayableness, and the femininity of Sikhandin. Formerly, when my sire wedded\nKali, he pleased (with me) gave me two boons, viz., that I should be incapable of being slain in battle, and that my\ndeath should depend on my own choice. I should, however, now wish my own death, this being the proper hour.\u2019\nAscertaining this to be the resolve of Bhishma of immeasurable energy, the Rishis and the Vasus stationed in the\nfirmament, said, \u2018That which hath been resolved by thee is approved by us also, O son! Act according to thy resolu-\ntion, O king. Withdraw thy heart from battle.\u2019 On the conclusion, of those words, fragrant and auspicious breeze\ncharged with particles of water, began to blow along a natural direction. 1 And celestial cymbals of loud sounds\nbegan to beat. And a flowery shower fell upon Bhishma, O sire. The words spoken by the Rishis and the Vasus,\nhowever, O king, were not heard by any one save Bhishma himself. I also heard them, through the power conferred\non me by the Muni. Great was the grief, O monarch, that filled the hearts of the celestials at the thought of Bhish-\nma, that favourite of all the worlds, falling down from his car. Having listened to these words of the celestials,\nSantanu\u2019s son Bhishma of great ascetic merit rushed out at Vibhatsu, even though he was then being pierced with\nsharp arrows capable of penetrating through every armour. Then Sikhandin, O king, excited with rage, struck the\ngrandsire of the Bharatas in the chest with nine sharp arrows. The Kuru grandsire Bhishma, however, though struck\nby him in battle, thus, trembled not, O monarch, but remained unmoved like a mountain during an earthquake.\nThen Vibhatsu, drawing his bow Gandiva with a laugh, pierced the son of Ganga with five and twenty arrows. And\n513 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nonce more, Dhananjaya, with great speed and\nexcited with wrath struck him in every vital part\nwith hundreds of arrows. Thus pierced by others,\nalso with thousands of arrows, the mighty\ncar-warrior Bhishma pierced those others in\nreturn with great speed. And as regards the\narrows shot by those warriors, Bhishma, pos-\nsessed of prowess in battle that was incapable of\nbeing baffled, equally checked them all with his\nown straight arrows. Those arrows, however,\nendued with wings of gold and whetted on stone,\nwhich the mighty car-warrior Sikhandin shot in\nthat battle, scarcely caused Bhishma any pain.\nThen the diadem-decked (Arjuna), excited with\nrage and placing Sikhandin to the fore, ap-\nproached Bhishma (nearer) and once more cut\nImage 3.3: Fight with Ghatotkacha | This folio from the Mahabharata off his bow.

The son of Ganga\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain then took up another bow that was stronger.\nWithin, however, the twinkling of an eye, as soon,\nin fact, as it was taken up, Arjuna cut that bow also into three fragments with three broad-headed shafts. And thus\nthe son of Pandu cut off in that battle even all the bows of Bhishma. After that, Bhishma the son of Santanu, no\nlonger desired to battle with Arjuna. The latter, however, then pierced him with five and twenty arrows. That great\nbowman, thus pierced greatly, then addressed Dussasana, and skid, \u2018Behold, Partha, that great car-warrior of the\nPandavas, excited with wrath in battle, pierceth me alone with many thousands of arrows. He is incapable of being\nvanquished in battle by the wielder of the thunder-bolt himself. As regards myself also, O hero, the very gods,\nDanavas and Rakshasas united together, are incapable of vanquishing me. What I shall say then of mighty car-war-\nriors among men?\u2019 While Bhishma was thus speaking to Dussasana, Phalguni with sharp shafts, and placing\nSikhandin to the fore, pierced Bhishma in that battle. Then Bhishma, deeply and excessively pierced by the wielder\nof Gandiva with keen-pointed shafts, once more addressed Dussasana with a smile and said, \u2018These arrows coursing\ntowards me in one continuous line, whose touch resembleth that of heaven\u2019s bolt, have been shot by Arjuna. These\nare not Sikhandin\u2019s. Cutting me to the quick, piercing through even my hard coat of mail, and striking me with the\nforce of mushalas, these arrows are not Sikhandin\u2019s. Of touch as hard as that of the Brahmana\u2019s rod (of chastise-\nment), 1 and of impetus unbearable as that of the thunder-bolt, these arrows are afflicting my vital forces. These are\nnot Sikhandin\u2019s. Of the touch of maces and spiked bludgeons, those arrows are destroying my vital forces like\nmessengers of Death commissioned (by the grim king himself). These are not Sikhandin\u2019s. Like angry snakes of\nvirulent poison, projecting their tongues out, these are penetrating into my vitals. These are not Sikhandin\u2019s--these\nthat cut me to the quick like the cold of winter cutting kine to the quick. Save the heroic wielder of Gandiva, viz.,\nthe ape-bannered Jishnu, even all other kings united together cannot cause me pain. Saying these words, Bhishma,\nthe valiant son of Santanu, as if for the object of consuming the Pandavas, hurled a dart at Partha. Partha, however,\ncaused that dart to drop down, cutting it into three fragments with three shafts, in the very sight, O Bharata, of all\nthe Kuru heroes of thy army. Desirous of obtaining either death or victory, the son of Ganga then took up a sword\nand a shield decked with gold. Before, however, he could come down from his car, Arjuna cut off by means of his\narrows, that shield into a hundred fragments. And that feat of his seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then the king\nYudhishthira urged his own troops, saying, \u2018Rush ye at Ganga\u2019s son. Do not entertain the slightest fear\u2019. Then, armed\nwith bearded darts, and lances, and arrows, from all sides, with axes, and excellent scimitars, and long shafts of\ngreat sharpness, with calf-toothed arrows, and broad-headed shafts, they all rushed at that single warrior. Then\narose from among the Pandava host a loud shout. Then thy sons also, O king, desirous of Bhishma\u2019s victory, sur-\nrounded him and uttered leonine shouts. Fierce was the battle fought there between thy troops and those of the\nenemy on that the tenth day, O king, when Bhishma and Arjuna met together. Like unto the vortex that occurs at\nthe spot where the Ganga meets the Ocean, for a short while a vortex occurred there where the troops of both\narmies met and struck one another down. And the Earth, wet with gore, assumed a fierce form. And the even and\nthe uneven spots on her surface could no longer be distinguished. Although Bhishma was pierced in all his vital\nlimbs, yet on that the tenth day he stayed (calmly) in battle, having slain ten thousand warriors. Then that great\nbowman, Partha, stationed at the head of his troops, broke the centre of the Kuru army. Ourselves then, afraid of\n514 The Mahabharata\nKunti\u2019s son Dhananjaya having white steeds attached to his car, and afflicted by him with polished weapons, fled\naway from the battle. The Sauviras, the Kitavas, the Easterners, the Westerners, the Northerners, the Malavas, the\nAbhishahas, the Surasenas, the Sivis, the Vasatis, the Salwas, the Sayas, the Trigartas, the Amvashthas, and the\nKaikeyas. 1--these and many other illustrious warriors,--afflicted with arrows and pained by their wounds, aban-\ndoned Bhishma in that battle while he was fighting with the diadem-decked (Arjuna). Then a great many warriors,\nsurrounding that single warrior on all sides, defeated the Kurus (that protected him) and covered him with shower\nof arrows. Throw down, Seize, Fight, Cut into pieces,--this was the furious uproar, O king, heard in the vicinity of\nBhishma\u2019s car. Having slain in that battle, O monarch, (his foes) by hundreds and thousands, there was not in\nBhishma\u2019s body space of even two fingers\u2019 breadth that was not pierced with arrows. Thus was thy sire mangled with\narrows of keen points by Phalguni in that battle. And then he fell down from his car with his head to the east, a little\nbefore sunset, in the very sight of thy sons. And while Bhishma fell, loud cries of alas and oh, O Bharata, were heard\nin the welkin uttered by the celestials and the kings of the earth. And beholding the high-souled grandsire falling\ndown (from his car), the hearts of all of us fell with him. That foremost of all bowmen, that mighty-armed hero, fell\ndown, like an uprooted standard of Indra, making the earth tremble the while. 2 Pierced all over with arrows, his\nbody touched not the ground. At that moment, O bull of Bharata\u2019s race, a divine nature took possession of that great\nbowman lying on a bed of arrows. The clouds poured a (cool) shower (over him) and the Earth trembled. While\nfalling he had marked that the Sun was then in the southern solstice. That hero, therefore, permitted not his senses\nto depart, thinking of that (inauspicious) season (of death). And all around in the welkin he heard celestial voices\nsaying, \u2018Why, Oh why, should Ganga\u2019s son, that foremost of all warriors of weapons, yield up his life during the\nsouthern declension?\u2019 Hearing these words, the son of Ganga answered, \u2018I am alive!\u2019 Although fallen upon the\nearth, the Kuru grandsire Bhishma, expectant of the northern declension, suffered not his life to depart. Ascertain-\ning that to be his resolve, Ganga, the daughter of Himavat, sent unto him the great Rishis in swanlike form. Then\nthose Rishis in the forms of swans inhabiting the Manasa lake, quickly rose up, and came together, for obtaining a\nsight of the Kuru grandsire Bhishma, to that spot where that foremost of men was lying on his bed of arrows. Then\nthose Rishis in swanlike forms, coming to Bhishma, beheld that perpetuator of Kuru\u2019s race lying on his bed of\narrows. Beholding that high-souled son of Ganga, that chief of the Bharatas, they walked round him, and the Sun\nbeing then in the southern solstice, they said, addressing one another, these words, \u2018Being a high-souled person,\nwhy should Bhishma pass out (of the world) during the southern declension?\u2019 Having said these words, those swans\nwent away, proceeding towards the southern direction. Endued with great intelligence, Bhishma, O Bharata.\nbeholding them, reflected for a moment. And the son of Santanu then said unto them. \u2018I will never pass out (of the\nworld) as long as the Sun is in the southern solstice. Even this is my resolve. I will proceed to my own ancient abode\nwhen the Sun reacheth the northern solstice. Ye swans, I tell you this truly. Expectant of the northern declension I\nwill hold my life. Since I have the fullest control over the yielding up of my life, I will, therefore, hold life, expectant\nof death during the northern declension. The boon that was granted to me by my illustrious sire, to the effect that\nmy death would depend on my own wish O, let that boon become true. I will hold my life, since I have control in\nthe matter of laying it down.\u2019 Having said these words to those swans, he continued to lie down on his bed of\narrows.\n\u201cWhen that crest of the Kuru race, viz., Bhishma of great energy, fell down, the Pandavas and the Srinjayas\nuttered leonine shouts. When the grandsire of the Bharatas who was endued with great might was overthrown, thy\nson, O bull of Bharata\u2019s race, knew not what to do. And all the Kurus were entirely deprived of their senses. And the\nKurus headed by Kripa, and Duryodhana, sighed and wept. And from grief they remained for a long while deprived\nof their senses. And they remained perfectly still, O monarch, without setting their hearts on battle. As if seized by\nthighs, they stood motionless, without proceeding against the Pandavas. When Santanu\u2019s son Bhishma of mighty\nenergy, who was (regarded as) unslayable, was slain, all of us thought that the destruction of the Kuru king was at\nhand. 1 Vanquished by Savyasachin, with our foremost heroes slain, and ourselves mangled with sharp arrows, we\nknew not what to do. And the heroic Pandavas possessed of massive arms that looked like spiked maces, having\nobtained the victory and won a highly blessed state in the other world, 1 all blew their great conches. And the So-\nmakas and the Panchalas all rejoiced, O king. Then when thousands of trumpets were blown, the mighty Bhimase-\nna slapped his arm-pits and uttered loud shouts. When the all-powerful son of Ganga was slain, the heroic warriors\nof both armies, laying down their weapons, began to reflect thoughtfully. And some uttered loud shrieks and some\nfled away, and some were deprived of their senses. And some censured the practices of the Kshatriya order and\nsome applauded Bhishma. And the Rishis and the Pitris all applauded Bhishma of high vows. And the deceased\nancestors of the Bharatas also praised Bhishma. Meanwhile the valiant and intelligent Bhishma, the son of Santa-\nnu, having recourse to that Yoga which is taught in the great Upanishads and engaged in mental prayers, remained\nquiet, expectant of his hour.\u201d\nBook 7\n515 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nBattle of Kurukshetra: Drona\nSection CXCI\n\u201cSanjaya said, \u2018Then Drona caused a great carnage among the Panchalas, like the slaughter caused by Sakra\nhimself in rage amongst the Danavas in the days of yore. The great car-warriors of the Pandava army, endued with\nmight and energy, though slaughtered, O king, by Drona\u2019s weapons, were not yet afraid of Drona in that battle.\nIndeed, O monarch, those mighty car-warriors, viz., the Panchalas and the Srinjayas, all rushed against Drona\nhimself, for fighting with him. Loud and fierce were the yells they uttered as they rushed towards Drona for en-\ncompassing him on all sides and were slaughtered by him with shafts and darts. Beholding the slaughter of the\nPanchalas in that battle by the illustrious Drona, and seeing his, weapons overwhelm all sides, fear entered the\nhearts of the Pandavas. Beholding that dreadful carnage of steeds and human beings in that battle, the Pandavas, O\nmonarch, became hopeless of victory. (They began to say unto each other) \u2018Is it not evident that Drona, that war-\nrior conversant with the mightiest of weapons, will consume us all like a raging conflagration consuming a heap of\nstraw in the season of spring? There is none competent to even look at him in battle. Conversant with the ways of\nmorality, Arjuna (who alone is a match for him) will not fight with him.\u2019 Beholding the sons of Kunti afflicted with\nthe shafts of Drona and inspired with fear, Kesava, endued with great intelligence and, devoted to their welfare,\naddressed Arjuna and said, \u2018This foremost of all bowmen is incapable of being ever vanquished by force in battle,\nby the very gods with Vasava at their head. When, however, he lays aside his weapons, he becomes capable of being\nslain on the field even by human beings. Casting aside virtue, ye sons of Pandu, adopt now some contrivance for\ngaining the victory, so that Drona of the golden car may not slay us all in battle. Upon the full of (his son) Aswat-\nthaman he will cease to fight, I think. Let sonic man, therefore, tell him that Aswatthaman, hath been slain in battle.\u2019\nThis advice, however, O kin was not approved by Kunti\u2019s son, Dhananjaya. Others approved of it. But Yudhishthira\naccepted it with great difficulty. Then the mighty-armed Bhima, O king, slew with a mace a foe-crushing, terrible\nand huge elephant named Aswatthaman, of his own army, belonging to Indravarman, the chief of the Malavas.\nApproaching Drona then in that battle with some bashfulness Bhimasena began to exclaim aloud, \u2018Aswatthaman\nhath been slain.\u2019 That elephant named Aswatthaman having been thus slain, Bhima spoke of Aswatthaman\u2019s slaugh-\nter. Keeping the true fact within his mind, he said what was untrue, Hearing those highly disagreeable words of\nBhima and reflecting upon them, Drona\u2019s limbs seemed to dissolve like sands in water. Recollecting however, the\nprowess of his son, he soon came to regard that intelligence as false. Hearing, therefore, of his slaughter, Drona did\nnot become unmanned. Indeed, soon recovering his senses, he became comforted, remembering that his son was\nincapable of being resisted by foes. Rushing towards the son of Prishata and desirous of slaying that hero who had\nbeen ordained as his slayer, he covered him with a thousand keen shafts, equipped with kanka feathers. Then twenty\nthousand Panchala car-warriors of great energy covered him, while he was thus careering in battle, with their shafts.\nCompletely shrouded with those shafts, we could not any longer see that great car-warrior who then resembled,\nO monarch, the sun, covered with clouds in the season of rains. Filled with wrath and desirous of compassing the\ndestruction of those brave Panchalas, that mighty car-warrior, that scorcher of foes, viz., Drona, dispelling all those\nshafts of the Panchalas, then invoked into existence the Brahma weapon. At that time, Drona looked resplendent\nlike a smokeless, blazing fire. Once more filled with rage the valiant son of Bharadwaja slaughtering all the Somak-\nas, seemed to be invested with great splendour. In that dreadful battle, he felled the heads of the Panchalas and cut\noff their massive arms, looking like spiked maces and decked with golden ornaments. Indeed, those Kshatriyas,\nslaughtered in battle by Bharadwaja\u2019s son fell down on the earth and lay scattered like trees uprooted by the tempest.\nIn consequence of fallen elephants and steeds, O Bharata, the earth, miry with flesh and blood, became impassable.\nHaving slain twenty thousand Panchala car-warriors, Drona, in that battle, shone resplendent like a smokeless,\nblazing fire. Once more filled with rage, the valiant son of Bharadwaja cut off, with a broad-headed arrow, the head\nof Vasudana from his trunk. Once more slaying five hundred Matsyas, and six thousand elephants, he slew ten\nthousand steeds. Beholding Drona stationed on the field for the extermination of the Kshatriya race, the Rishis\nViswamitra, and Jamadagni, and Bharadwaja, and Gautama, and Vasishtha, and Kasyapa, and Atri, and the Srikatas,\nthe Prisnis, Garga, the Valkhilyas, the Marichis, the descendants of Bhrigu and Angiras, and diverse other sages\nof subtle forms quickly came thither, with the Bearer of sacrificial libations at their head, and, desirous of taking\nDrona unto the region of Brahman, addressed Drona, that ornament of battle, and said, \u2018Thou art fighting unrigh-\nteously. The hour of thy death is come. Laying aside thy weapons in battle, O Drona, behold us stationed here. After\nthis, it behoveth thee not to perpetrate such exceedingly cruel deeds. Thou art versed in the Vedas and their branch-\nes. Thou art devoted to the duties enjoined by truth, especially, thou art a Brahmana. Such acts do not become thee.\nLay aside thy weapons. Drive away the film of error that shrouds thee. Adhere now to the eternal path. The period\nfor which thou art to dwell in the world of men is now full. Thou hast, with the Brahma weapon, burnt men on\nearth that are unacquainted with weapons. This act that thou hast perpetrated, O regenerate one, is not righteous.\nLay aside thy weapons in battle without delay, O Drona, do not wait longer on earth. Do not, O regenerate one, per-\n516 The Mahabharata\npetrate such a sinful act.\u2019 Hearing these words of their as also those spoken by Bhimasena, and beholding Dhrishta-\ndyumna before him, Drona became exceedingly cheerless in battle. Burning with grief and exceedingly afflicted,\nhe enquired of Kunti\u2019s son Yudhishthira as to whether his son (Aswatthaman) had been slain or not. Drona firmly\nbelieved that Yudhishthira would never speak an untruth even for the sake of the sovereignty of the three worlds.\nFor this reason, that bull among Brahmanas asked Yudhishthira and not any body else. He had hoped for truth\nfrom Yudhishthira from the latter\u2019s infancy.\n\u201cMeanwhile, O monarch, Govinda, knowing that Drona, that foremost of warriors, was capable of sweeping\nall the Pandavas off the face of the earth, became much distressed. Addressing Yudhishthira he said, \u2018If Drona\nfighteth, filled with rage, for even half-a-day, I tell thee truly, thy army will then be annihilated. Save us, then, from\nDrona. under such circumstances, falsehood is better than truth. By telling an untruth for saving a life, one is not\ntouched by sin. There is no sin in untruth spoken unto women, or in marriages, or for saving king, or for rescuing\na Brahmana.\u2019 1 While Govinda and Yudhishthira were thus talking with each other, Bhimasena (addressing the\nking) said, \u2018As soon, O monarch, as I heard of the means by which the high-souled Drona might be slain, putting\nforth my prowess in battle, I immediately slew a mighty elephant, like unto the elephant of Sakra himself, belonging\nto Indravarman, the chief of the Malavas, who was standing within thy army. I then went to Drona and told him,\n\u2018Aswatthaman has been slain, O Brahmana! Cease, then, to fight. Verily, O bull among men, the preceptor did not\nbelieve in the truth of words. Desirous of victory as thou art, accept the advice of Govinda. Tell Drona, O King, that\nthe son of Saradwat\u2019s daughter is no more. Told by thee, that bull among Brahmanas will never fight. Thou, O ruler\nof men, art reputed to be truthful in the three worlds.\u2019 Hearing those words of Bhima and induced by the counsels\nof Krishna, and owing also to the inevitability of destiny, O monarch, Yudhishthira made up his mind to say what\nhe desired. Fearing to utter an untruth, but earnestly desirous of victory, Yudhishthira distinctly said that Aswattha-\nman was dead, adding indistinctly the world elephant (after the name), Before this, Yudhishthira\u2019s car had stayed at\na height of four fingers\u2019 breadth from the surface of the earth; after, however, he had said that untruth, his (vehicle\nand) animals touched the earth. Hearing those words from Yudhishthira, the mighty car-warrior Drona, afflicted\nwith grief, for the (supposed) death of his son, yielded to the influence of despair. By the words, again, of the Rishis,\nhe regarded himself a great offender against the high-souled Pandavas. Hearing now about the death of his son, he\nbecame perfectly cheerless and filled with anxiety; upon beholding Dhrishtadyumna, O king, that chastiser of foes\ncould not fight as before.\u2019\u201d\nSection CXCII\n\u201cSanjaya said, \u2018Beholding Drona filled with great anxiety and almost deprived of his senses by grief, Dhrishta-\ndyumna, the son of the Panchala king, rushed at him. That hero had, for the destruction of Drona, been obtained by\nDrupada, that ruler of men, at a great sacrifice, from the Bearer of sacrificial libations. Desirous of slaying Drona, he\nnow took up a victory-giving and formidable bow whose twang resembled the roll of the clouds, whose string was\npossessed of great strength, and which was irrefragable and celestial. And he fixed on it a fierce arrow, resembling a\nsnake of virulent poison and possessed of the splendour of fire. That arrow, resembling a fire of fierce flame, while\nwithin the circle of his bow, looked like the autumnal sun of great splendour within a radiant circle. Beholding that\nblazing bow bent with force by Prishata\u2019s son, the troops regarded that to be the last hour (of the world). Seeing that\narrow aimed at him, the valiant son of Bharadwaja thought that the last hour of his body had come. The preceptor\nprepared with care to baffle that shaft. The weapons, however, of that high-souled one, O monarch, no longer\nappeared at his bidding. 1 His weapons had not been exhausted although he had shot them ceaselessly for four days\nand one night. On the expiry, however, of the third part of that of the fifth day, his arrows became exhausted. Seeing\nthe exhaustion of his arrows and afflicted with grief on account of his son\u2019s death, and in consequence also of the\nunwillingness of the celestial weapons to appear at his bidding, he desired to lay aside his weapons, as requested by\nthe words of the Rishis also. Though filled with great energy, he could not however, fight as before. Then taking up\nanother celestial bow that Angiras had given him, and certain arrows that resembled a Brahmana\u2019s curse, he contin-\nued to fight with Dhrishtadyumna. He covered the Panchala prince with a thick shower of arrows, and filled with\nrage, mangled his angry antagonist. With his own keen shafts he cut off in a hundred fragments those of the prince\nas also the latter\u2019s standard and bow. He then his antagonist\u2019s driver. Then Dhrishtadyumna, smiling, took up anoth-\ner bow, and pierced Drona with a keen shaft in the centre of the chest. Deeply pierced therewith and losing his\nself-possession in that encounter, that mighty bowman, then, with a sharp and broad-headed arrow, once more cut\noff Dhrishtadyumna\u2019s bow. Indeed, the invincible Drona then cut off all the weapons, O king, and all the bows that\nhis antagonist had, with the exception only of his mace and sword. Filled with rage, he then pierced the angry\nDhrishtadyumna, O chastiser of foes, nine keen arrows, capable of taking the life of every foe. Then the mighty\ncar-warrior Dhrishtadyumna, of immeasurable soul, invoking into existence the Brahma weapon, caused the steeds\nof his own car to be mingled with those of his foes. Endued with the speed of the wind, those steeds that were red\n517 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nand of the hue of pigeons, O bull of Bharata\u2019s race, thus mingled together, looked exceedingly beautiful. Indeed, O\nking, those steeds thus mingled together on the field of battle, looked beautiful like roaring clouds in the season of\nrains, charged with lightning. Then that twice-born one of immeasurable soul cut off the shaft-joints, the wheel-\njoints, and (other) car-joints of Dhrishtadyumna. Deprived of his bow, and made carless and steedless and driver-\nless, the heroic Dhrishtadyumna, fallen into great distress, grasped a mace. Filled with rage, the mighty car-warrior,\nDrona, of unbaffled prowess, by means of a number of keen shafts, cut off that mace, while it was on the point of\nbeing hurled at him. Beholding his mace cut off by Drona with arrows, that tiger among men, (viz., the Panchala\nprince), took up a spotless sword and a bright shield decked with a hundred moons. Without doubt, under those\ncircumstances, the Panchala prince determined to make an end of that foremost of preceptors, that high-souled\nwarrior. Sometimes, sheltering himself in his car-box and sometimes riding on his car-shafts, the prince moved\nabout, uplifting his swords and whirling his bright shield. The mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna, desirous of\nachieving, from folly, a difficult feat, hoped to pierce the chest of Bharadwaja\u2019s son in that battle. Sometimes, he\nstayed upon the yoke, and sometimes under the haunches of Drona\u2019s red steeds. These movements of his were\nhighly applauded by all the troops. Indeed, while he stayed amid the trappings of the yoke or behind those red\nsteeds, Drona found no opportunity to strike him. All this seemed exceedingly wonderful. The movements of both\nDrona and Prishata\u2019s son in that battle resembled the fight of hawk careering through the welkin for a piece of meat.\nThen Drona, by means of a dart pierced the white steeds of his antagonist, one after another, not striking, however,\nthe red ones amongst them (that belonged to himself) 1. Deprived of life, those steeds of Dhrishtadyumna fell\ndown upon the earth. Thereupon, the red steeds of Drona himself, O king, where freed from the entanglements of\nDhrishtadyumna\u2019s car. Beholding his steeds slain by that foremost of Brahmanas, Prishata\u2019s sons, that mighty\ncar-warrior, that foremost of fighters, could not brook it. Though deprived of his car, still that foremost of all\nswordsmen, armed with his sword, sprang towards Drona, O monarch, like Vinata\u2019s son (Garuda) making a swoop\nat a snake. The form, O king, of Dhrishtadyumna at that time, when he sought to slay the son of Bharadwaja,\nresembled the form of Vishnu himself in days of yore when at the point of slaying Hiranyakasipu. He performed\ndiverse evolutions, in fact. O Kauravya, the son of Prishata, careering in that battle, exhibited the well-known one\nand twenty different kinds of motion. Armed with the sword, and shield in hand, Prishata\u2019s son wheeled about and\nwhirled his sword on high, and made side thrusts, and rushed forward, and ran sideways, and leapt high, and\nassailed the flanks of his antagonists and receded backwards, and closed with his foes, and pressed them hard.\nHaving practised them well, he also showed the evolutions called Bharata, Kausika Satwata, as he careened in that\nbattle for compassing the destruction of Drona, Beholding those beautiful evolutions of Dhrishtadyumna, as he\ncareered on the field, sword and shield in hand, all the warriors, as also the celestials assembled there, were filled\nwith wonder. The regenerate Drona then, shooting a thousand arrows in the thick of fight, cut off the sword of\nDhrishtadyumna as also his shield, decked with a hundred moons. Those arrows that Drona shot, while fighting\nfrom such a near point, were of the length of a span. Such arrows are used only in close fight. None else have arrows\nof that kind, except Kripa, and Partha, and Aswatthaman and Karna, Pradyumna and Yuyudhana; Abhimanyu also\nhad such arrows. Then the preceptor, desirous of slaying his disciple who was unto him even as his own son, fixed\non his bow-string a shaft endued with great impetuosity. That shaft, however, Satyaki cut off by means of ten arrows,\nin the very sight of thy son as also of the high-souled Karna, as thus rescued Dhrishtadyumna who was on the point\nof succumbing to Drona. Then Kesava and Dhananjaya beheld Satyaki of prowess incapable of being baffled, who,\nO Bharata, was thus careering in the car-tracks (of the Kuru warriors) and within the range of the shafts of Drona\nand Karna and Kripa. Saying. \u2018Excellent, Excellent!\u2019 both of them loudly applauded Satyaki of unfading glory, who\nwas thus destroying the celestial weapons of all those warriors. Then Kesava and Dhananjaya rushed towards the\nKurus. Addressing Krishna, Dhananjaya said, \u2018Behold, O Kesava, that perpetuator of Madhu\u2019s race, viz., Satyaki of\ntrue prowess, sporting before the preceptor and those mighty car-warriors and gladdening me and the twins and\nBhima and king Yudhishthira. With skill acquired by practice and without insolence, behold that enhancer of the\nfame of the Vrishnis, viz., Satyaki, careering in battle, sporting the while with those mighty car-warriors. All these\ntroops, as also the Siddhas (in the welkin), beholding him invincible in battle, are filled with wonder, and applaud-\ning him, saying, \u2018Excellent, Excellent!\u2019 Indeed, O king, the warriors of both armies all applauded the Satwata hero,\nfor his feats.\u2019\u201d\nSection CXCIII\n\u201cSanjaya said, \u2018Beholding those feats of the Satwata hero, Duryodhana and others, filled with rage, quickly\nencompassed the grandson of Sini on all sides. Kripa and Karna, of also thy sorts, O sire, in that battle, quickly\napproaching the grandson of Sini, began to strike him with keen arrows. Then king Yudhishthira, and the two other\nPandavas, viz., the two sons of Madri and Bhimasena of great might surrounded Satyaki (for protecting him).\nKarna, and the mighty car-warrior Kripa, and Duryodhana and others, all resisted Satyaki, pouring showers of\n518 The Mahabharata\narrows on him. The grand son of Sini, however, contending with all those car-warriors, baffled, O monarch, that\nterrible downpour of arrows, so suddenly created by his foes. Indeed, in that dreadful battle, Satyaki, by means of\nhis own celestial weapons, duly resisted all those celestial weapons aimed at him by those illustrious warriors. The\nfield of battle became full of many cruel sights upon that encounter of those royal combatants, resembling that\nscene of yore when Rudra, filled with rage, had destroyed all creatures. Human arms and heads and bows, O\nBharata, and umbrellas displaced (from cars), and yak-tails, were seen lying in heaps on the field of battle. The earth\nbecame quickly strewn with broken wheels and cars, and massive arms lopped off from trunks, and brave horsemen\ndeprived of life. And, O foremost one among the Kurus, large number of warriors, mangled with falling arrows,\nwere seen in that great battle to roll and writhe on the ground in agony of the last spasms of death. During the prog-\nress of that terrible battle, resembling the encounter in days of old between the celestials and the Asuras, king\nYudhishthira the just, addressing his warriors, said, Putting forth all your vigour, rush, ye great car-warriors, against\nthe Pot-born! Yonder the heroic son of Prishata is engaged with Drona! He is endeavouring to the utmost of his\nmight, to slay the son of Bharadwaja. Judging from the aspect he is presenting in this great battle, it is evident that\nfilled with rage, he will today overthrow Drona. Uniting together, all of you fight with the Pot-born.\u2019 Thus ordered\nby Yudhishthira, the mighty car-warriors of the Srinjayas all rushed with great vigour to slay the son of Bharadwaja.\nThat mighty car-warrior, viz., Bharadwaja\u2019s son, quickly rushed against those advancing warriors, knowing for\ncertain that he would die. When Drona, of sure aim, thus proceeded, the earth trembled violently. Fierce winds\nbegan to blow, inspiring the (hostile) ranks with fear. Large meteors fell, seemingly issuing out of the sun, blazing\nfiercely as they fell and foreboding great terrors. The weapons of Drona, O sire, seemed to blaze forth. Cars seemed\nto produce loud rattles, and steeds to shed tears. The mighty car-warrior, Drona, seemed to be divested of his\nenergy, His left eye and left hand began to twitch. Beholding Prishata\u2019s son, again, before him, and bearing in mind\nthe words of the Rishis about his leaving the world for heaven, he became cheerless. He then desired to give up life\nby fighting fairly. Encompassed on all sides by the troops of Drupada\u2019s son, Drona began to career in battle, con-\nsuming large numbers of Kshatriyas. That grinder of foes, having slain four and twenty thousand Kshatriyas, then\ndespatched to Yama\u2019s abode ten times ten thousand, by means of his shafts of keen points. Exerting himself with\ncare, he seemed to stand in that battle like a smokeless fire. For the extermination of the Kshatriya race, he then had\nrecourse to the Brahma weapon. Then the mighty Bhima, beholding the illustrious and irresistible prince of the\nPanchalas carless and weaponless, quickly proceeded towards him. Beholding him striking at Drona from a near\npoint, that grinder of foes took up Dhrishtadyumna on his own car and said unto him, \u2018Save thee there is no other\nman that can venture to fight with the preceptor. Be quick to slay him. The burden of his slaughter rests upon thee.\u2019\nThus addressed by Bhima, the mighty-armed Dhrishtadyumna speedily took up a strong, a new and a superb bow\ncapable of bearing a great strain. Filled with rage, and shooting his arrows in that battle at the irresistible Drona,\nDhrishtadyumna covered the preceptor, desirous of withstanding him. Those two ornaments of battle then, both\nforemost of fighters and both filled with rage, invoked into existence the Brahma and diverse other celestial weap-\nons. Indeed, O king, Dhrishtadyumna covered Drona with many mighty weapons in that encounter. Destroying all\nthe weapons of Bharadwaja\u2019s son, the Panchala prince, that warrior of unfading glory, began to slay the Vasatis, the\nSivis, the Valhikas and the Kurus, that is, them, who protected Drona in that battle. Indeed, O king, shooting\nshowers of arrows on all sides, Dhrishtadyumna at that time looked resplendent like the sun himself shedding his\nthousands of rays. Drona, however, once more cut off the prince\u2019s bow and pierced the vitals of the prince himself\nwith many arrows. Thus pierced, the prince felt great pain. Then Bhima, of great wrath, holding the car of Drona, O\nmonarch, slowly said these words unto him: If wretches amongst Brahmanas, discontented with the avocations of\ntheir own order, but well-versed in arms, did not fight, the Kshatriya order then would not have been thus extermi-\nnated. Abstention from injury to all creatures hath been said to be the highest of all virtues. The Brahmana is the\nroot of that virtue. As regards thyself, again, thou art the foremost of all persons acquainted with Brahma. Slaying\nall those Mlecchas and other warriors, who, however, are all engaged in the proper avocations of their order, moved\nthereto by ignorance and folly, O Brahmana, and by the desire of wealth for benefiting sons and wives; indeed, for\nthe sake of an only son, why dost thou not feel ashamed? He for whom thou hast taken up weapons, and for whom\nthou livest, he, deprived of life, lieth today on the field of battle, unknown to thee and behind thy back. King\nYudhishthira the just hath told thee this. It behoveth thee not to doubt this fact.\u2019 Thus addressed by Bhima, Drona\nlaid aside his bow. Desirous of laying aside all his weapons also, Bharadwaja\u2019s son of virtuous soul said aloud, \u2018O\nKarna, Karna, O great bowman, O Kripa, O Duryodhana, I tell you repeatedly, exert yourselves carefully in battle.\nLet no injury happen to you from the Pandayas. As regards myself, I lay aside my weapons.\u2019 Saying these words, he\nbegan loudly to take the name of Aswatthaman. Laying aside his weapons then in that battle, and sitting down on\nthe terrace of his car, he devoted himself to Yoga and assured all creatures, dispelling their fears. Beholding that\nopportunity, Dhrishtadyumna mustered all his energy. Laying down on the car his formidable bow, with arrow\nfixed on the bow-string, he took up a sword, and jumping down from his vehicle, rushed quickly against Drona. All\ncreatures, human beings and others, uttered exclamation of woe, beholding Drona thus brought under Dhrishta-\n519 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ndyumna\u2019s power. Loud cries of Oh and Alas were uttered, as also those of Oh and Fie. As regards Drona himself,\nabandoning his weapons, he was then in a supremely tranquil state. Having said those words he had devoted himself\nto Yoga. Endued with great effulgence and possessed of high ascetic merit, he had fixed his heart on that Supreme\nand Ancient Being, viz., Vishnu. Bending his face slightly down, and heaving his breast forward, and closing his eyes,\nand resting ort the quality of goodness, and disposing his heart to contemplation, and thinking on the monosyllable\nOm, representing. Brahma, and remembering the puissant, supreme, and indestructible God of gods, the radiant\nDrona or high ascetic merit, the preceptor (of the Kurus and the Pandavas) repaired to heaven that is so difficult of\nbeing attained even by the pious. Indeed, when Drona thus proceeded to heaven it seemed to us that there were then\ntwo suns in the firmament. The whole welkin was ablaze and seemed to be one vast expanse of equal light when the\nsun-like Bharadwaja, of solar effulgence, disappeared. Confused sounds of joy were heard, uttered by the delighted\ncelestials. When Drona thus repaired to the region of Brahman, Dhrishtadyumna stood, unconscious of it all, beside\nhim. Only we five amongst men beheld the high-souled Drona rapt in Yoga proceed to the highest region of blessed-\nness. These five were myself, Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, and Drona\u2019s son, Aswatthaman, and Vasudeva of Vrish-\nni\u2019s race, and king Yudhishthira the just, the son of Pandu. Nobody else, O king, could see that glory of the wise\nDrona, devoted to Yoga, while passing out of the world. In fact, all human beings were unconscious of the fact that\nthe preceptor attained to the supreme region of Brahman, a region mysterious to the very gods, and one that is the\nhighest of all. Indeed, none of them could see the preceptor, that chastiser of foes, proceed to the region of Brahman,\ndevoted to Yoga in the company of the foremost of Rishis, his body mangled with arrows and bathed in blood, after\nhe had laid aside his weapons. As regards Prishata\u2019s son, though everybody cried fie on him, yet casting his eyes on\nthe lifeless Drona\u2019s head, he began to drag it. With his sword, then, he lopped off from his foe\u2019s trunk that head,--his\nfoe remained speechless the while. Having slain Bharadwaja\u2019s son. Dhrishtadyumna was filled with great joy, and\nuttered leonine shouts, whirling his sword. Of a dark complexion, with white locks hanging down to his ears, that old\nman of five and eighty years of age, used, for thy sake only, to career on the field of battle with the activity of a youth\nof sixteen. The mighty-armed Dhananjaya, the son of Kunti, (before Drona\u2019s head was cut off) had said, \u2018O son of\nDrupada, bring the preceptor alive, do not slay him. He should not be slain.\u2019 Even thus all the troops also had cried\nout. Arjuna, in particular, melted with pity, had cried out repeatedly. Disregarding, however, the cries of Arjuna as\nalso these of all the kings, Dhrishtadyumna stew Drona, that bull among men, on the terrace of his car. Covered with\nDrona\u2019s blood, Dhrishtadyumna then Jumped from the car down upon the ground. Looking red like the sun, he then\nseemed to be exceedingly fierce. Thy troops beheld Drona slain even thus in that battle. Then Dhrishtadyumna. that\ngreat bowman, O king, threw down that large head of Bharadwaja\u2019s son before the warriors of thy army. Thy soldiers,\nO monarch, beholding the head of Bharadwaja\u2019s son, set their hearts on flight and ran away in all directions. Mean-\nwhile Drona, ascending the skies, entered the stellar path. Through the grace of the Rishis Krishna (Dwaipayana), the\nson of Satyavati, I witnessed, O king, the (true circumstances about the) death of Drona. I beheld that illustrious one\nproceeding, after he had ascended the sky, like a smokeless brand of blazing splendour. Upon the fall of Drona, the\nKurus, the Pandavas and the Srinjayas, all became cheerless and ran away with great speed. The army then broke up.\nMany had been slain, and many wounded by means of keen shafts. Thy warriors (in particular), upon the fall of\nDrona, seemed to be deprived of life. Having sustained a defeat, and being inspired with fear about the future, the\nKurus regarded themselves deprived of both the worlds. Indeed, they lost all self-control. 1 Searching for the body of\nBharadwaja\u2019s, son, O monarch, on the field covered with thousands of headless trunks, the kings could not find it.\nThe Pandavas, having gained the victory and great prospects of renown in the future, began to make loud sounds\nwith their arrows and conchs and uttered loud leonine roars. Then Bhimasena, O king, and Dhrishtadyumna, the son\nof Prishata, were seen in the midst of the (Pandava) host to embrace each other. Addressing the son of Prishata, that\nscorcher of foes, viz., Bhima said, \u2018I will again embrace thee, O son of Prishata, as one crowned with victory, when\nthat wretch of a Suta\u2019s son shall be slain in battle, as also that other wretch, viz., Duryodhana.\u2019 Having said these\nwords, Bhimasena, the son of Pandu, filled with transports of joy, caused the earth to tremble with slaps on his\narmpits. Terrified by that sound, thy troops ran away from battle, forgetting the duties of the Kshatriyas and setting\ntheir hearts on flight. The Pandavas, having become victors, became very glad, O monarch, and they felt great\nhappiness, derived from the destruction of their foes in battle.\u2019\u201d\nBook 8\nBattle of Kurukshetra: Karna\nSection XC\n\u201cSanjaya said, \u2018Flying away in consequence of the falling of Arjuna\u2019s arrows, the broken divisions of the Kau-\nravas, staying at a distance, continued to gaze at Arjuna\u2019s weapon swelling with energy and careering around with\nthe effulgence of lightning. Then Karna, with showers of terrible shafts, baffled that weapon of Arjuna while it was\n520 The Mahabharata\nstill careering in the welkin and which Arjuna had shot with great vigour in that fierce encounter for the destruc-\ntion of his foe. Indeed, that weapon (of Partha) which, swelling with energy, had been consuming the Kurus, the\nSuta\u2019s son now crushed with his shafts winged with gold. Bending then his own loud-sounding bow of irrefragable\nstring, Karna shot showers of shafts. The Suta\u2019s son destroyed that burning weapon of Arjuna with his own foe-kill-\ning weapon of great power which he had obtained from Rama, and which resembled (in efficacy) an Atharvan rite.\nAnd he pierced Partha also with numerous keen shafts. The encounter then, O king, that took place between\nArjuna and the son of Adhiratha, became a very dreadful one. They continued to strike each other with arrows like\ntwo fierce elephants striking each other with their tusks. All the points of the compass then became shrouded with\nweapons and the very sun became invisible. Indeed, Karna and Partha, with their arrowy downpours, made the\nwelkin one vast expanse of arrows without any space between. All the Kauravas and the Somakas then beheld a\nwide-spread arrowy net. In that dense darkness caused by arrows, they were unable to see anything else. Those two\nforemost of men, both accomplished in weapons, as they incessantly aimed and shot innumerable arrows, O king,\ndisplayed diverse kinds of beautiful manoeuvres. While they were thus contending with each other in battle,\nsometimes the Suta\u2019s son prevailed over his rival and sometimes the diadem-decked Partha prevailed over his, in\nprowess and weapons and lightness of hands. Beholding that terrible and awful passage-at-arms between those two\nheroes each of whom was desirous of availing himself of the other\u2019s lapses, all the other warriors on the field of\nbattle became filled with wonder. The beings in the welkin, O king, applauded Karna and Arjuna. Indeed, many of\nthem at a time, filled with joy, cheerfully shouted, sometimes saying, \u201cExcellent, O Karna!\u201d and sometimes saying,\n\u201cExcellent, O Arjuna!\u201d During the progress of that fierce encounter, while the earth was being pressed deep with the\nweight of cars and the tread of steeds and elephants, the snake Aswasena, who was hostile to Arjuna, was passing\nhis time in the nether region. Freed from the conflagration at Khandava, O king, he had, from anger, penetrated\nthrough the earth (for going to the subterranean region). That brave snake, recollecting the death of his mother and\nthe enmity he on that account harboured against Arjuna, now rose from the lower region. Endued with the power\nof ascending the skies, he soared up with great speed upon beholding that fight between Karna and Arjuna. Think-\ning that that was the time for gratifying his animosity towards, as he thought, the wicked-souled Partha, he quickly\nentered into Karna\u2019s quiver, O king, in the form of an arrow. At that time a net of arrows was seen, shedding its\nbright arrows around. Karna and Partha made the welkin one dense mass of arrows by means of their arrowy\ndownpours. Beholding that wide-spread expanse of arrows, all the Kauravas and the Somakas became filled with\nfear. In that thick and awful darkness caused by arrows they were unable to see anything else. Then those two tigers\namong men, those two foremost of all bowmen in the world, those two heroes, fatigued with their exertions in\nbattle, looked at each other. Both of them were then fanned with excellent and waving fans made of young (palm)\nleaves and sprinkled with fragrant sandal-water by many Apsaras staying in the welkin. And Sakra and Surya, using\ntheir hands, gently brushed the faces of those two heroes. When at last Karna found that he could not prevail over\nPartha and was exceedingly scorched with the shafts of the former, that hero, his limbs very much mangled, set his\nheart upon that shaft of his which lay singly within a quiver. The Suta\u2019s son then fixed on his bow-string that\nfoe-killing, exceedingly keen, snake-mouthed, blazing, and fierce shaft, which had been polished according to rule,\nand which he had long kept for the sake of Partha\u2019s destruction. Stretching his bow-string to his ear, Karna fixed\nthat shaft of fierce energy and blazing splendour, that ever-worshipped weapon which lay within a golden quiver\namid sandal dust, and aimed it at Partha. Indeed, he aimed that blazing arrow, born in Airavata\u2019s race, for cutting off\nPhalguna\u2019s head in battle. All the points of the compass and the welkin became ablaze and terrible meteors, and\nthunderbolts fell. When that snake of the form of an arrow was fixed on the bow-string, the Regents of the world,\nincluding Sakra, set up loud wails. The Suta\u2019s son did not know that the snake Aswasena had entered his arrow by\nthe aid of his Yoga powers. Beholding Vaikartana aim that arrow, the high-souled ruler of the Madras, addressing\nKarna, said, \u201cThis arrow, O Karna, will not succeed in striking off Arjuna\u2019s head. Searching carefully, fix another\narrow that may succeed in striking off thy enemy\u2019s head.\u201d Endued with great activity, the Suta\u2019s son, with eyes\nburning in wrath, then said unto the ruler of the Madras, \u201cO Shalya, Karna never aimeth an arrow twice. Persons\nlike us never become crooked warriors.\u201d Having said these words, Karna, with great care, let off that shaft which he\nhad worshipped for many long years. Bent upon winning the victory, O king, he quickly said unto his rival, \u201cThou\nart slain, O Phalguna!\u201d Sped from Karna\u2019s arms, that shaft of awful whizz, resembling fire or the sun in splendour, as\nit left the bow-string, blazed up in the welkin and seemed to divide it by a line such as is visible on the crown of a\nwoman dividing her tresses. Beholding that shaft blazing in the welkin, the slayer of Kamsa, Madhava, with great\nspeed and the greatest ease, pressed down with his feet that excellent car, causing it to sink about a cubit deep. At\nthis, the steeds, white as the rays of the moon and decked in trappings of gold, bending their knees, laid themselves\ndown on the ground. Indeed, seeing that snake (in the form of an arrow) aimed by Karna, Madhava, that foremost\nof all persons endued with might, put forth his strength and thus pressed down with his feet that car into the earth,\nwhereat the steeds, (as already said) bending down their knees, laid themselves down upon the earth when the car\nitself had sank into it. Then loud sounds arose in the welkin in applause of Vasudeva. Many celestial voices were\n521 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nheard, and celestial flowers were showered upon Krishna, and leonine shouts also were uttered. When the car had\nthus been pressed down into the earth through the exertions of the slayer of Madhu, the excellent ornament of\nArjuna\u2019s head, celebrated throughout the earth, the welkin, heaven, and the waters, the Suta\u2019s son swept off from the\ncrown of his rival, with that arrow, in consequence of the very nature of that snaky weapon and the great care and\nwrath with which it had been shot. That diadem, endued with the splendour of the sun or the moon or fire or a\nplanet, and adorned with gold and pearls and gems and diamonds, had with great care been made by the puissant\nSelf-born himself for Purandara. Costly as its appearance indicated, it was inspiring terror in the hearts of foes,\ncontributing to the happiness of him that wore it, and shedding a fragrance, that ornament had been given by the\nchief of the celestials himself with a cheerful heart unto Partha while the latter had proceeded to slaughter the foes\nof the gods. That diadem was incapable of being crushed by Rudra and the Lord of waters and Kuvera with Pinaka\nand noose and thunderbolt and the very foremost of shafts. It could not be endured by even the foremost ones\namong the gods. Vrisha, however, now broke it forcibly with his snake-inspired shaft. Endued with great activity,\nthat wicked-natured snake of fierce form and false vows, falling upon that diadem-decked with gold and gems,\nswept it away from Arjuna\u2019s head. That snake, O king, forcibly tore it away from Partha\u2019s head, quickly reducing into\nfragments that well-made ornament set over with many a gem and blazing with beauty, like the thunderbolt riving a\nmountain summit decked with lofty and beautiful trees graced with flowers. Crushed by that excellent weapon,\npossessed of splendour, and blazing with the fire of (the snake\u2019s) poison, that beautiful and much-liked diadem of\nPartha fell down on the earth like the blazing disc of the Sun from the Asta hills. Indeed, that snake forcibly swept\naway from Arjuna\u2019s head that diadem adorned with many gems, like the thunder of Indra felling a beautiful moun-\ntain summit adorned with lofty trees bearing budding leaves and flowers. And the earth, welkin, heaven, and the\nwaters, when agitated by a tempest, roar aloud, O Bharata, even such was the roar that arose in all the worlds at that\ntime. Hearing that tremendous noise, people, notwithstanding their efforts to be calm, became extremely agitated\nand reeled as they stood. Reft of diadem, the dark complexioned and youthful Partha looked beautiful like a blue\nmountain of lofty summit. Binding then his locks with a white cloth, Arjuna stood perfectly unmoved. With that\nwhite gear on his head, he looked like the Udaya hill illumined with the rays of the sun. Thus that she-snake (whom\nArjuna had killed at Khandava) of excellent mouth, through her son in the form of an arrow, sped by Surya\u2019s son,\nbeholding Arjuna of exceeding energy and might standing with his head at a level with the reins of the steeds, took\naway his diadem only, that well-made ornament (formerly) owned by Aditi\u2019s son and endued with the effulgence of\nSurya himself. But Arjuna also (as will appear in the sequel) did not return from that battle without causing the\nsnake to succumb to the power of Yama. Sped from Karna\u2019s arms, that costly shaft resembling fire or the sun in\neffulgence, viz., that mighty snake who from before had become the deadly foe of Arjuna, thus crushing the latter\u2019s\ndiadem, went away. Having burnt the gold-decked diadem of Arjuna displayed on his head, he desired to come to\nArjuna once more with great speed. Asked, however, by Karna (who saw him but knew him not), he said these\nwords, \u201cThou hadst sped me, O Karna, without having seen me. It was for this that I could not strike off Arjuna\u2019s\nhead. Do thou quickly shoot me once again, after seeing me well. I shall then slay thy foe and mine too.\u201d Thus\naddressed in that battle by him, the Suta\u2019s son said, \u201cWho are you possessed of such fierce form?\u201d The snake an-\nswered, saying, \u201cKnow me as one that has been wronged by Partha. My enmity towards him is due to his having\nslain my mother. If the wielder of the thunderbolt himself were to protect Partha, the latter would still have to go to\nthe domains of the king of the pitris. Do not disregard me. Do my bidding. I will slay thy foe. Shoot me without\ndelay.\u201d Hearing those words, Karna said, \u201cKarna, O snake, never desires to have victory in battle today by relying on\nanother\u2019s might. Even if I have to slay a hundred Arjunas, I will not, O snake, still shoot the same shaft twice.\u201d Once\nmore addressing him in the midst of battle, that best of men, viz., Surya\u2019s son, Karna, said, \u201cAided by the nature of\nmy other snaky weapons, and by resolute effort and wrath, I shall slay Partha. Be thou happy and go elsewhere.\u201d\nThus addressed, in battle, by Karna, that prince of snakes, unable from rage to bear those words, himself proceeded,\nO king, for the slaughter of Partha, having assumed the form of an arrow. Of fierce form, the desire he ardently\ncherished was the destruction of his enemy. Then Krishna, addressing Partha in that encounter, said into him, \u201cSlay\nthat great snake inimical to thee.\u201d Thus addressed by the slayer of Madhu, the wielder of Gandiva, that bowman\nwho was always fierce unto foes, enquired of him, saying, \u201cWho is that snake that advanceth of his own accord\nagainst me, as if, indeed he advanceth right against the mouth of Garuda?\u201d Krishna replied, \u201cWhilst thou, armed\nwith bow, wert engaged at Khandava in gratifying the god Agni, this snake was then in the sky, his body ensconced\nwithin his mother\u2019s. Thinking that it was only a single snake that was so staying in the sky, thou killedest the\nmother. Remembering that act of hostility done by thee, he cometh towards thee today for thy destruction. O\nresister of foes, behold him coming like a blazing meteor, falling from the firmament!\u2019\u201d\n\u201cSanjaya continued, \u2018Then Jishnu, turning his face in rage, cut off, with six keen shafts, that snake in the welkin\nas the latter was coursing in a slanting direction. His body thus cut off, he fell down on the earth. After that snake\nhad been cut off by Arjuna, the lord Keshava himself, O king, of massive arms, that foremost of beings, raised up\nwith his arms that car from the earth. At that time, Karna, glancing obliquely at Dhananjaya, pierced that foremost\n522 The Mahabharata\nof persons, viz., Krishna, with ten shafts whetted on stone and equipped with peacock feathers. Then Dhananjaya,\npiercing Karna with a dozen well-shot and keen arrows equipped with heads like the boar\u2019s ear, sped a cloth-yard\nshaft endued with the energy of a snake of virulent poison and shot from his bow-string stretched to his ear. That\nforemost of shafts, well shot by Arjuna, penetrated through Karna\u2019s armour, and as if suspending his life breaths,\ndrank his blood and entered the earth, its wings also having been drenched with gore. Endued with great activity,\nVrisha, enraged at the stroke of the shaft, like a snake beaten with stick, shot many mighty shafts, like snakes of\nvirulent poison vomiting venom. And he pierced Janardana with a dozen shafts and Arjuna with nine and ninety.\nAnd once more piercing the son of Pandu with a terrible shaft, Karna laughed and uttered a loud roar. The son of\nPandu, however, could not endure his enemy\u2019s joy. Acquainted with all the vital parts of the human body, Partha,\npossessed of prowess like that of Indra, pierced those vital limbs with hundreds of arrows even as Indra had struck\nVala with great energy. Then Arjuna sped ninety arrows, each resembling the rod of Death at Karna. Deeply pierced\nwith those shafts, Karna trembled like a mountain riven with thunder. The head-gear of Karna, adorned with costly\ngems and precious diamonds and pure gold, as also his earrings, cut off by Dhananjaya with his winged arrows, fell\ndown on the earth. The costly and bright armour also of the Suta\u2019s son that had been forged with great care by many\nforemost of artists working for a long time, the son of Pandu cut off within a moment in many fragments. After\nthus divesting him of his armour, Partha then, in rage, pierced Karna with four whetted shafts of great energy.\nStruck forcibly by his foe, Karna suffered great pain like a diseased person afflicted by bile, phlegm, wind, and fever.\nOnce more Arjuna, with great speed, mangled Karna, piercing his very vitals, with numerous excellent shafts, of\ngreat keenness, and sped from his circling bow with much force and speed and care. Deeply struck by Partha with\nthose diverse arrows of keen points and fierce energy, Karna (covered with blood) looked resplendent like a moun-\ntain of red chalk with streams of red water running adown its breast. Once more Arjuna pierced Karna in the centre\nof the chest with many straight-coursing and strong shafts made entirely of iron and equipped with wings of gold\nand each resembling the fiery rod of the Destroyer, like the son of Agni piercing the Krauncha mountains. Then the\nSuta\u2019s son, casting aside his bow that resembled the very bow of Sakra, as also his quiver, felt great pain, and stood\ninactive, stupefied, and reeling, his grasp loosened and himself in great anguish. The virtuous Arjuna, observant of\nthe duty of manliness, wished not to slay his enemy while fallen into such distress. The younger brother of Indra\nthen, with great excitement, addressed him, saying, \u201cWhy, O son of Pandu, dost thou become so forgetful? They\nthat are truly wise never spare their foes, however weak, even for a moment. He that is learned earneth both merit\nand fame by slaying foes fallen into distress. Lose no time in precipitately crushing Karna who is always inimical to\nthee and who is the first of heroes. The Suta\u2019s son, when able, will once more advance against thee as before. Slay\nhim, therefore, like Indra slaying the Asura Namuci.\u201d Saying, \u201cSo be it, O Krishna!\u201d and worshipping Janardana,\nArjuna, that foremost of all persons in Kuru\u2019s race once more quickly pierced Karna with many excellent arrows\nlike the ruler of heaven, piercing the Asura, Samvara. The diadem-decked Partha, O Bharata, covered Karna and his\ncar and steeds with many calf-toothed arrows, and putting forth all his vigour he shrouded all the points of the\ncompass with shafts equipped with wings of gold. Pierced with those arrows equipped with heads like the calf\u2019s\ntooth, Adhiratha\u2019s son of broad chest looked resplendent like an Asoka or Palasa or Salmali decked with its flowery\nload or a mountain overgrown with a forest of sandal trees. Indeed, with those numerous arrows sticking to his\nbody, Karna, O monarch, in that battle, looked resplendent like the prince of mountains with its top and glens\novergrown with trees or decked with flowering Karnikaras. Karna also shooting repeated showers of arrows, looked,\nwith those arrows constituting his rays, like the sun coursing towards the Asta hills, with disc bright with crimson\nrays. Shafts, however, of keen points, sped from Arjuna\u2019s arms, encountering in the welkin the blazing arrows,\nresembling mighty snakes, sped from the arms of Adhiratha\u2019s son, destroyed them all. Recovering his coolness, and\nshooting many shafts that resembled angry snakes, Karna then pierced Partha with ten shafts and Krishna with half\na dozen, each of which looked like an angry snake. Then Dhananjaya desired to shoot a mighty and terrible arrow,\nmade wholly of iron, resembling the poison of snake or fire in energy, and whose whizz resembling the peal of\nIndra\u2019s thunder, and which was inspired with the force of a high (celestial) weapon. At that time, when the hour of\nKarna\u2019s death had come, Kala, approaching invisibly, and alluding to the Brahmana\u2019s curse, and desirous of inform-\ning Karna that his death was near, told him, \u201cThe Earth is devouring thy wheel!\u201d Indeed, O foremost of men, when\nthe hour of Karna\u2019s death came, the high brahmastra that the illustrious Bhargava had imparted unto him, escaped\nfrom his memory. And the earth also began to devour the left wheel of his car. Then in consequence of the curse of\nthat foremost of Brahmanas, Karna\u2019s car began to reel, having sunk deep into the earth and having been transfixed\nat that spot like a sacred tree with its load of flowers standing upon an elevated platform. When his car began to reel\nfrom the curse of the Brahmana, and when the high weapon he had obtained from Rama no longer shone in him\nthrough inward light, and when his terrible snake-mouthed shaft also had been cut off by Partha, Karna became\nfilled with melancholy. Unable to endure all those calamities, he waved his arms and began to rail at righteousness\nsaying, \u201cThey that are conversant with righteousness always say that righteousness protects those that are righteous.\nAs regards ourselves, we always endeavour, to the best of our ability and knowledge to practise righteousness. That\n523 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nrighteousness, however, is destroying us now instead of protecting us that are devoted to it. I, therefore, think that\nrighteousness does not always protect its worshippers.\u201d While saying these words, he became exceedingly agitated\nby the strokes of Arjuna\u2019s arrows. His steeds and his driver also were displaced from their usual position. His very\nvitals having been struck, he became indifferent as to what he did, and repeatedly railed at righteousness in that\nbattle. He then pierced Krishna in the arm with three terrible arrows, and Partha, too, with seven. Then Arjuna\nsped seven and ten terrible arrows, perfectly straight and of fierce impetuosity, resembling fire in splendour and like\nunto Indra\u2019s thunder in force. Endued with awful impetuosity, those arrows pierced Karna and passing out of his\nbody fell upon the surface of the earth. Trembling at the shock, Karna then displayed his activity to the utmost of\nhis power. Steadying himself by a powerful effort he invoked the brahmastra. Beholding the brahmastra, Arjuna\ninvoked the Aindra weapon with proper mantras. Inspiring gandiva, its string, and his shafts also, with mantras,\nthat scorcher of foes poured showers like Purandara pouring rain in torrents. Those arrows endued with great\nenergy and power, issuing out of Partha\u2019s car, were seen to be displayed in the vicinity of Karna\u2019s vehicle. The mighty\ncar-warrior Karna baffled all those shafts displayed in his front. Seeing that weapon thus destroyed, the Vrishni\nhero, addressing Arjuna, said, \u201cShoot high weapons, O Partha! The son of Radha baffles thy shafts.\u201d With proper\nmantras, Arjuna then fixed the brahmastra on his string, and shrouding all the points of the compass with arrows,\nPartha struck Karna (with many) arrows. Then Karna, with a number of whetted shafts endued with great energy,\ncut off the string of Arjuna\u2019s bow. Similarly he cut off the second string, and then the third, and then the fourth, and\nthen the fifth. The sixth also was cut off by Vrisha, and then the seventh, then the eighth, then the ninth, then the\ntenth, and then at last the eleventh. Capable of shooting hundreds upon hundreds of arrows, Karna knew not that\nPartha had a hundred strings to his bow. Tying another string to his bow and shooting many arrows, the son of\nPandu covered Karna with shafts that resembled snakes of blazing mouths. So quickly did Arjuna replace each\nbroken string that Karna could not mark when it was broken and when replaced. The feat seemed to him to be\nexceedingly wonderful. The son of Radha baffled with his own weapons those of Savyasaci. Displaying also his own\nprowess, he seemed to get the better of Dhananjaya at that time. Then Krishna, beholding Arjuna afflicted with the\nweapons of Karna, said these words unto Partha: \u201cApproaching Karna, strike him with superior weapons.\u201d Then\nDhananjaya, filled with rage, inspiring with mantras another celestial weapons that looked like fire and that resem-\nbled the poison of the snake and that was as hard as the essence of adamant, and uniting the Raudra weapon with it,\nbecame desirous of shooting it at his foe. At that time, O king, the earth swallowed up one of wheels of Karna\u2019s car.\nQuickly alighting then from his vehicle, he seized his sunken wheel with his two arms and endeavoured to lift it up\nwith a great effort. Drawn up with force by Karna, the earth, which had swallowed up his wheel, rose up to a height\nof four fingers\u2019 breadth, with her seven islands and her hills and waters and forests. Seeing his wheel swallowed, the\nson of Radha shed tears from wrath, and beholding Arjuna, filled with rage he said these words, \u201cO Partha, O\nPartha, wait for a moment, that is, till I lift this sunken wheel. Beholding, O Partha, the left wheel of my car swal-\nlowed through accident by the earth, abandon (instead of cherishing) this purpose (of striking and slaying me) that\nis capable of being harboured by only a coward. Brave warriors that are observant of the practices of the righteous,\nnever shoot their weapons at persons with dishevelled hair, or at those that have turned their faces from battle, or at\na Brahmana, or at him who joins his palms, or at him who yields himself up or beggeth for quarter or at one who\nhas put up his weapon, or at one whose arrows are exhausted, or at one whose armour is displaced, or at one whose\nweapon has fallen off or been broken! Thou art the bravest of men in the world. Thou art also of righteous be-\nhaviour, O son of Pandu! Thou art well-acquainted with the rules of battle. For these reasons, excuse me for a\nmoment, that is, till I extricate my wheel, O Dhananjaya, from the earth. Thyself staying on thy car and myself\nstanding weak and languid on the earth, it behoveth thee not to slay me now. Neither Vasudeva, nor thou, O son of\nPandu, inspirest me with the slightest fear. Thou art born in the Kshatriya order. Thou art the perpetuator of a high\nrace. Recollecting the teachings of righteousness, excuse me for a moment, O son of Pandu!\u201d\u2019\u201d\nSection XCI\n\u201cSanjaya said, \u2018Then Vasudeva, stationed on the car, addressed Karna, saying, \u201cBy good luck it is, O son of Radha,\nthat thou rememberest virtue! It is generally seen that they that are mean, when they sink into distress, rail at Provi-\ndence but never at their own misdeeds. Thyself and Suyodhana and Duhshasana and Shakuni, the son of Subala, had\ncaused Draupadi, clad in a single piece of raiment, to be brought into the midst of the assembly. On that occasion, O\nKarna, this virtue of thine did not manifest itself. When at the assembly Shakuni, an adept in dice, vanquished Kunti\u2019s\nson Yudhishthira who was unacquainted with it, whither had this virtue of thine gone? When the Kuru king (Duryo-\ndhana), acting under thy counsels, treated Bhimasena in that way with the aid of snakes and poisoned food, whither\nhad this virtue of thine then gone? When the period of exile into the woods was over as also the thirteenth year, thou\ndidst not make over to the Pandavas their kingdom. Whither had this virtue of thine then gone? Thou didst set fire\nto the house of lac at Varanavata for burning to death the sleeping Pandavas. Whither then, O son of Radha, had this\nvirtue of thine gone? Thou laughedest at Krishna while she stood in the midst of the assembly, scantily dressed be-\n524 The Mahabharata\ncause in her season and obedient to Duhshasana\u2019s will, whither, then, O Karna, had this virtue of thine gone? When\nfrom the apartment reserved for the females innocent Krishna was dragged, thou didst not interfere. Whither, O son\nof Radha, had this virtue of thine gone? Thyself addressing the princess Draupadi, that lady whose tread is as digni-\nfied as that of the elephant, in these words, viz., \u2018The Pandavas, O Krishna, are lost. They have sunk into eternal hell.\nDo thou choose another husband!\u2019 thou lookedest on the scene with delight. Whither then, O Karna, had this virtue\nof thine gone? Covetous of kingdom and relying on the ruler of the Gandharvas, thou summonedest the Pandavas\n(to a match of dice). Whither then had this virtue of thine gone? When many mighty car-warriors, encompassing the\nboy Abhimanyu in battle, slew him, whither had this virtue of thine then gone? If this virtue that thou now invokest\nwas nowhere on those occasions, what is the use then of parching thy palate now, by uttering that word? Thou art\nnow for the practice of virtue, O Suta, but thou shalt not escape with life. Like Nala who was defeated by Pushkara\nwith the aid of dice but who regained his kingdom by prowess, the Pandavas, who are free from cupidity, will recover\ntheir kingdom by the prowess of their arms, aided with all their friends. Having slain in battle their powerful foes,\nthey, with the Somakas, will recover their kingdom. The Dhartarashtras will meet with destruction at the hands of\nthose lions among men (viz., the sons of Pandu), that are always protected by virtue!\u2019\u201d\n\u201cSanjaya continued, \u2018Thus addressed, O Bharata, by Vasudeva, Karna hung down his head in shame and gave\nno answer. With lips quivering in rage, he raised his bow, O Bharata, and, being endued with great energy and\nprowess, he continued to fight with Partha. Then Vasudeva, addressing Phalguna, that bull among men, said, \u201cO\nthou of great might, piercing Karna with a celestial weapon, throw him down.\u201d Thus addressed by the holy one,\nArjuna became filled with rage. Indeed, remembering the incidents alluded to by Krishna, Dhananjaya blazed up\nwith fury. Then, O king, blazing flames of fire seemed to emanate from all the pores of the angry Partha\u2019s body. The\nsight seemed to be exceedingly wonderful. Beholding it, Karna, invoking the brahmastra, showered his shafts upon\nDhananjaya, and once more made an effort to extricate his car. Partha also, by the aid of the brahmastra, poured\narrowy downpours upon Karna. Baffling with his own weapon the weapon of his foe, the son of Pandu continued to\nstrike him. The son of Kunti then, aiming at Karna sped another favourite weapon of his that was inspired with the\nenergy of Agni. Sped by Arjuna, that weapon blazed up with its own energy. Karna, however, quenched that confla-\ngration with the Varuna weapon. The Suta\u2019s son also, by the clouds he created, caused all the points of the compass\nto be shrouded with a darkness such as may be seen on a rainy day. The son of Pandu, endued with great energy,\nfearlessly dispelled those clouds by means of the Vayavya weapon in the very sight of Karna. The Suta\u2019s son then, for\nslaying the son of Pandu, took up a terrible arrow blazing like fire. When that adored shaft was fixed on the bow-\nstring, the earth, O king, trembled with her mountains and waters and forests. Violent winds began to blow, bearing\nhard pebbles. All the points of the compass became enveloped with dust. Wails of grief, O Bharata, arose among the\ngods in the welkin. Beholding that shaft aimed by the Suta\u2019s son, O sire, the Pandavas, with cheerless hearts, gave\nthemselves up to great sorrow. That shaft of keen point and endued with the effulgence of Sakra\u2019s thunder, sped\nfrom Karna\u2019s arms, fell upon Dhananjaya\u2019s chest and penetrated it like a mighty snake penetrating an ant-hill. That\ngrinder of foes, viz., the high-souled Vibhatsu, thus deeply pierced in that encounter, began to reel. His grasp\nbecame loosened, at which his bow Gandiva dropped from his hand. He trembled like the prince of mountains in\nan earthquake. Availing himself of that opportunity, the mighty car-warrior Vrisha, desirous of extricating his\ncar-wheel that had been swallowed up by the earth, jumped down from his vehicle. Seizing the wheel with his two\narms he endeavoured to drag it up, but though possessed of great strength, he failed in his efforts, as destiny would\nhave it. Meanwhile the diadem-decked and high-souled Arjuna, recovering his senses, took up a shaft, fatal as the\nrod of Death, and called anjalika. Then Vasudeva, addressing Partha, said, \u201cCut off with thy arrow the head of this\nenemy of thine, viz., Vrisha, before he succeeds in getting upon his car.\u201d Applauding those words of the lord Va-\nsudeva, and while the wheel of his enemy was still sunk, the mighty car-warrior Arjuna took up a razor-headed\narrow of blazing effulgence and struck the standard (of Karna) bearing the elephant\u2019s rope and bright as the spotless\nsun. That standard bearing the device of the costly elephant\u2019s rope, was adorned with gold and pearls and gems and\ndiamonds, and forged with care by foremost of artists excelling in knowledge, and possessed of great beauty, and\nvariegated with pure gold. That standard always used to fill thy troops with high courage and the enemy with fear.\nIts form commanded applause. Celebrated over the whole world, it resembled the sun in splendour. Indeed, its\neffulgence was like that of fire or the sun or the moon. The diadem-decked Arjuna, with that razor-headed shaft,\nexceedingly sharp, equipped with wings of gold, possessed of the splendour of fire when fed with libations of\nclarified butter, and blazing with beauty, cut off that standard of Adhiratha\u2019s son, that great car-warrior. With that\nstandard, as it fell, the fame, pride, hope of victory, and everything dear, as also the hearts of the Kurus, fell, and\nloud wails of \u201cOh!\u201d and \u201cAlas!\u201d arose (from the Kuru army). Beholding that standard cut off and thrown down by\nthat hero of Kuru\u2019s race possessed of great lightness of hand, thy troops, O Bharata, were no longer hopeful of\nKarna\u2019s victory. Hastening then for Karna\u2019s destruction, Partha took out from his quiver an excellent Anjalika weapon\nthat resembled the thunder of Indra or the rod of fire and that was possessed of the effulgence of the thousand-rayed\nSun. Capable of penetrating the very vitals, besmeared with blood and flesh, resembling fire or the sun, made of\n525 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ncostly materials, destructive of men, steeds, and elephants, of straight course and fierce impetuosity, it measured\nthree cubits and six feet. Endued with the force of the thousand-eyed Indra\u2019s thunder, irresistible as Rakshasas in the\nnight, resembling Pinaka or Narayana\u2019s discus, it was exceedingly terrible and destructive of all living creatures.\nPartha cheerfully took up that great weapon, in the shape of an arrow, which could not be resisted by the very gods,\nthat high-souled being which was always adored by the son of Pandu, and which was capable of vanquishing the very\ngods and the Asuras. Beholding that shaft grasped by Partha in that battle, the entire universe shook with its mobile\nand immobile creatures. Indeed, seeing that weapon raised (for being sped) in that dreadful battle, the Rishis loudly\ncried out, \u201cPeace be to the universe!\u201d The wielder of Gandiva then fixed on his bow that unrivalled arrow, uniting it\nwith a high and mighty weapon. Drawing his bow Gandiva, he quickly said, \u201cLet this shaft of mine be like a mighty\nweapon capable of quickly destroying the body and heart of my enemy, if I have ever practised ascetic austerities,\ngratified my superiors, and listened to the counsels of well-wishers. Let this shaft, worshipped by me and possessed of\ngreat sharpness, slay my enemy Karna by that Truth.\u201d Having said these words Dhananjaya let off that terrible shaft\nfor the destruction of Karna, that arrow fierce and efficacious as a rite prescribed in the Atharvan of Angiras, blazing\nwith effulgence, and incapable of being endured by Death himself in battle. And the diadem-decked Partha, desirous\nof slaying Karna, with great cheerfulness, said, \u201cLet this shaft conduce to my victory. Shot by me, let this arrow\npossessed of the splendour of fire or the sun take Karna to the presence of Yama.\u201d Saying these words, Arjuna, decked\nwith diadem and garlands, cherishing feelings of hostility towards Karna and desirous of slaying him, cheerfully\nstruck his foe with that foremost of shafts which was possessed of the splendour of the sun or the moon and capable\nof bestowing victory. Thus sped by that mighty warrior, that shaft endued with the energy of the sun caused all the\npoints of the compass to blaze up with light. With that weapon Arjuna struck off his enemy\u2019s head like Indra striking\noff the head of Vritra with his thunder. Indeed, O king, with that excellent Anjalika weapon inspired with mantras\ninto a mighty weapon, the son of Indra cut off the head of Vaikartana in the afternoon. Thus cut off with that Anja-\nlika, the trunk of Karna fell down on the earth. The head also of that commander of the (Kaurava) army, endued with\nsplendour equal to that of the risen sun and resembling the meridian sun of autumn, fell down on the earth like the\nsun of bloody disc dropped down from the Asta hills. Indeed, that head abandoned with great unwillingness the\nbody, exceedingly beautiful and always nursed in luxury, of Karna of noble deeds, like an owner abandoning with\ngreat unwillingness his commodious mansion filled with great wealth. Cut off with Arjuna\u2019s arrow, and deprived of\nlife, the tall trunk of Karna endued with great splendour, with blood issuing from every wound, fell down like the\nthunder-riven summit of a mountain of red chalk with crimson streams running down its sides after a shower. Then\nfrom that body of the fallen Karna a light passing through the welkin penetrated the sun. This wonderful sight, O\nking, was beheld by the human warriors after the fall of Karna. Then the Pandavas, beholding Karna slain by Phalgu-\nna, loudly blew their conchs. Similarly, Krishna and Dhananjaya also, filled with delight, and losing no time, blew\ntheir conchs. The Somakas beholding Karna slain and lying on the field, were filled with joy and uttered loud shouts\nwith the other troops (of the Pandava army). In great delight they blew their trumpets and waved their arms and\ngarments. All the warriors, O king, approaching Partha, began to applaud him joyfully. Others, possessed of might,\ndanced, embracing each other, and uttering loud shouts, said, \u201cBy good luck, Karna hath been stretched on the earth\nand mangled with arrows.\u201d Indeed, the severed head of Karna looked beautiful like a mountain summit loosened by a\ntempest, or a quenched fire after the sacrifice is over, or the image of the sun after it has reached the Asta hills. The\nKarna-sun, with arrows for its rays, after having scorched the hostile army, was at last caused to be set by the mighty\nArjuna-time. As the Sun, while proceeding towards the Asta hills, retires taking away with him all his rays, even so\nthat shaft (of Arjuna) passed out, taking with it Karna\u2019s life breaths. The death hour of the Suta\u2019s son, O sire, was the\nafternoon of that day. Cut off with the Anjalika weapon in that battle, the head of Karna fell down along with his\nbody. Indeed, that arrow of Arjuna, in the very sight of the Kaurava troops, quickly took away the head and the body\nof Karna. Beholding the heroic Karna thrown down stretched on the earth, pierced with arrows and bathed in blood,\nthe king of the Madras, went away on that car deprived of its standard. After the fall of Karna, the Kauravas, deeply\npierced with shafts in that battle, and afflicted with fear, fled away from the field, frequently casting their eyes on that\nlofty standard of Arjuna that blazed with splendour. The beautiful head, graced with a face that resembled a lotus of a\n1,000 petals, of Karna whose feats were like those of the thousand-eyed Indra, fell down on the earth like the thou-\nsand-rayed sun as he looks at the close of day.\u2019\u201d\nBook 17\nEnd of Reign\nSection I\nOm! Having bowed down unto Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as also to the goddess Sarasvati,\nshould the word \u201cJaya\u201d be uttered.\n526 The Mahabharata\nJanamejaya said: \u201cHaving heard of that encounter with iron bolts between the heroes of the Vrishni and the\nAndhaka races, and having been informed also of Krishna\u2019s ascension to Heaven, what did the Pandavas do?\u201d\nVaishampayana said: \u201cHaving heard the particulars of the great slaughter of the Vrishnis, the Kaurava king\nset his heart on leaving the world. He addressed Arjuna, saying, \u2018O thou of great intelligence, it is Time that cooks\nevery creature (in his cauldron). I think that what has happened is due to the cords of Time (with which he binds us\nall). It behoveth thee also to see it.\u2019\n\u201cThus addressed by his brother, the son of Kunti only repeated the word \u2018Time, Time!\u2019 and fully endorsed the\nview of his eldest brother gifted with great intelligence. Ascertaining the resolution of Arjuna, Bhimasena and the\ntwins fully endorsed the words that Arjuna had said. Resolved to retire from the world for earning merit, they\nbrought Yuyutsu before them. Yudhishthira made over the kingdom to the son of his uncle by his Vaisya wife.\nInstalling Parikshit also on their throne, as king, the eldest brother of the Pandavas, filled with sorrow, addressed\nSubhadra, saying, \u2018This son of thy son will be the king of the Kurus. The survivor of the Yadus, Vajra, has been made\na king. Parikshit will rule in Hastinapura, while the Yadava prince, Vajra, will rule in Shakraprastha. He should be\nprotected by thee. Never set thy heart on unrighteousness.\u2019\n\u201cHaving said these words, king Yudhishthira the just, along with his brothers, promptly offered oblations of\nwater unto Vasudeva of great intelligence, as also unto his old maternal uncle and Rama and others. He then duly\nperformed the Sraddhas of all those deceased kinsmen of his. The king, in honour of Hari and naming him repeat-\nedly, fed the Island-born Vyasa, and Narada, and Markandeya possessed of wealth of penances, and Yajnavalkya of\nBharadwaja\u2019s race, with many delicious viands. In honour of Krishna, he also gave away many jewels and gems, and\nrobes and clothes, and villages, and horses and cars, and female slaves by hundreds and thousands unto foremost of\nBrahmanas. Summoning the citizens. Kripa was installed as the preceptor and Parikshit was made over to him as\nhis disciple, O chief of Bharata\u2019s race.\n\u201cThen Yudhishthira once more summoned all his subjects. The royal sage informed them of his intentions. The\ncitizens and the inhabitants of the provinces, hearing the king\u2019s words, became filled with anxiety and disapproved\nof them. \u2018This should never be done,\u2019 said they unto the king. The monarch, well versed with the changes brought\nabout by time, did not listen to their counsels. Possessed of righteous soul, he persuaded the people to sanction his\nviews. He then set his heart on leaving the world. His brothers also formed the same resolution. Then Dharma\u2019s\nson, Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, casting off his ornaments, wore barks of trees. Bhima and Arjuna and the\ntwins, and Draupadi also of great fame, similarly clad themselves in bark of trees, O king. Having caused the pre-\nliminary rites of religion, O chief of Bharata\u2019s race, which were to bless them in the accomplishment of their design,\nthose foremost of men cast off their sacred fires into the water. The ladies, beholding the princes in that guise, wept\naloud. They seemed to look as they had looked in days before, when with Draupadi forming the sixth in number\nthey set out from the capital after their defeat at dice. The brothers, however, were all very cheerful at the prospect\nof retirement. Ascertaining the intentions of Yudhishthira and seeing the destruction of the Vrishnis, no other\ncourse of action could please them then.\n\u201cThe five brothers, with Draupadi forming the sixth, and a dog forming the seventh, set out on their journey.\nIndeed, even thus did king Yudhishthira depart, himself the head of a party of seven, from the city named after the\nelephant. The citizen and the ladies of the royal household followed them for some distance. None of them, how-\never, could venture to address the king for persuading him to give up his intention. The denizens of the city then\nreturned; Kripa and others stood around Yuyutsu as their centre. Ulupi, the daughter of the Naga chief, O thou of\nKunti\u2019s race, entered the waters of Ganga. The princess Chitrangada set out for the capital of Manipura. The other\nladies who were the grandmothers of Parikshit centered around him. Meanwhile the high-souled Pandavas, O thou\nof Kuru\u2019s race, and Draupadi of great fame, having observed the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards\nthe east. Setting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe the religion of Renunciation,\ntraversed through various countries and reached diverse rivers and seas. Yudhishthira, proceeded first. Behind him\nwas Bhima; next walked Arjuna; after him were the twins in the order of their birth; behind them all, O foremost\none of Bharata\u2019s race, proceeded Draupadi, that first of women, possessed of great beauty, of dark complexion, and\nendued with eyes resembling lotus petals. While the Pandavas set out for the forest, a dog followed them.\n\u201cProceeding on, those heroes reached the sea of red waters. Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gan-\ndiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great\nvalue. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood\nthere in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, \u2018Ye heroic sons of Pan-\ndu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna,\nand ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kuru\u2019s race, I am the god of fire. The forest of\nKhandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna\nproceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious\ndiscus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world). When the time again comes,\n527 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nit will come back into his hands. This foremost of bows, Gandiva, was procured by me from Varuna for the use of\nPartha. Let it be made over to Varuna himself.\u2019\n\u201cAt this, all the brothers urged Dhananjaya to do what the deity said. He then threw into the waters (of the sea)\nboth the bow and the couple of inexhaustible quivers. After this, O chief of Bharata\u2019s race, the god of the fire disap-\npeared then and there. The heroic sons of Pandu next proceeded with their faces turned towards the south. Then, by\nthe northern coast of the salt sea, those princes of Bharata\u2019s race proceeded to the south-west. Turning next towards\nthe west, they beheld the city of Dwaraka covered by the ocean. Turning next to the north, those foremost ones\nproceeded on. Observant of Yoga, they were desirous of making a round of the whole Earth.\u201d\nSection II\nVaishampayana said: \u201cThose princes of restrained souls and devoted to Yoga, proceeding to the north, beheld\nHimavat, that very large mountain. Crossing the Himavat, they beheld a vast desert of sand. They then saw the\nmighty mountain Meru, the foremost of all high-peaked mountains. As those mighty ones were proceeding quickly,\nall rapt in Yoga, Yajnaseni, falling of from Yoga, dropped down on the Earth. Beholding her fallen down, Bhimasena\nof great strength addressed king Yudhishthira the just, saying, \u2018O scorcher of foes, this princess never did any sinful\nact. Tell us what the cause is for which Krishna has fallen down on the Earth!\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said: \u2018O best of men, though we were all equal unto her she had great partiality for Dhananjaya.\nShe obtains the fruit of that conduct today, O best of men.\u2019\u201d\nVaishampayana continued: \u201cHaving said this, that foremost one of Bharata\u2019s race proceeded on. Of righteous\nsoul, that foremost of men, endued with great intelligence, went on, with mind intent on itself. Then Sahadeva of\ngreat learning fell down on the Earth. Beholding him drop down, Bhima addressed the king, saying, \u2018He who with\ngreat humility used to serve us all, alas, why is that son of Madravati fallen down on the Earth?\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said, \u2018He never thought anybody his equal in wisdom. It is for that fault that this prince has fallen\ndown.\u2019\nVaishampayana continued: \u201cHaving said this, the king proceeded, leaving Sahadeva there. Indeed, Kunti\u2019s son\nYudhishthira went on, with his brothers and with the dog. Beholding both Krishna and the Pandava Sahadeva\nfallen down, the brave Nakula, whose love for kinsmen was very great, fell down himself. Upon the falling down of\nthe heroic Nakula of great personal beauty, Bhima once more addressed the king, saying, \u2018This brother of ours who\nwas endued with righteousness without incompleteness, and who always obeyed our behests, this Nakula who was\nunrivalled for beauty, has fallen down.\u2019\n\u201cThus addressed by Bhimasena, Yudhishthira, said, with respect to Nakula, these words: \u2018He was of righteous\nsoul and the foremost of all persons endued with intelligence. He, however, thought that there was nobody that\nequalled him in beauty of person. Indeed, he regarded himself as superior to all in that respect. It is for this that\nNakula has fallen down. Know this, O Vrikodara. What has been ordained for a person, O hero, must have to be\nendured by him.\u2019\n\u201cBeholding Nakula and the others fall down, Pandu\u2019s son Arjuna of white steeds, that slayer of hostile heroes,\nfell down in great grief of heart. When that foremost of men, who was endued with the energy of Shakra, had fallen\ndown, indeed, when that invincible hero was on the point of death, Bhima said unto the king, \u2018I do not recollect\nany untruth uttered by this high-souled one. Indeed, not even in jest did he say anything false. What then is that for\nwhose evil consequence this one has fallen down on the Earth?\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said, \u2018Arjuna had said that he would consume all our foes in a single day. Proud of his heroism,\nhe did not, however, accomplish what he had said. Hence has he fallen down. This Phalguna disregarded all wield-\ners of bows. One desirous of prosperity should never indulge in such sentiments.\u2019\u201d\nVaishampayana continued: \u201cHaving said so, the king proceeded on. Then Bhima fell down. Having fallen down,\nBhima addressed king Yudhishthira the just, saying, \u2018O king, behold, I who am thy darling have fallen down. For\nwhat reason have I dropped down? Tell me if thou knowest it.\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said, \u2018Thou wert a great eater, and thou didst use to boast of thy strength. Thou never didst at-\ntend, O Bhima, to the wants of others while eating. It is for that, O Bhima, that thou hast fallen down.\u2019\n\u201cHaving said these words, the mighty-armed Yudhishthira proceeded on, without looking back. He had only\none companion, the dog of which I have repeatedly spoken to thee, that followed him now.\nSection III\nVaishampayana said: \u201cThen Shakra, causing the firmament and the Earth to be filled by a loud sound, came to\nthe son of Pritha on a car and asked him to ascend it. Beholding his brothers fallen on the Earth, king Yudhishthi-\nra the just said unto that deity of a 1,000 eyes these words: \u2018My brothers have all dropped down here. They must\ngo with me. Without them by me I do not wish to go to Heaven, O lord of all the deities. The delicate princess\n528 The Mahabharata\n(Draupadi) deserving of every comfort, O Purandara, should go with us. It behoveth thee to permit this.\u2019\n\u201cShakra said, \u2018Thou shalt behold thy brothers in Heaven. They have reached it before thee. Indeed, thou shalt\nsee all of them there, with Krishna. Do not yield to grief, O chief of the Bharatas. Having cast off their human bod-\nies they have gone there, O chief of Bharata\u2019s race. As regards thee, it is ordained that thou shalt go thither in this\nvery body of thine.\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said, \u2018This dog, O lord of the Past and the Present, is exceedingly devoted to me. He should go\nwith me. My heart is full of compassion for him.\u2019\n\u201cShakra said, \u2018Immortality and a condition equal to mine, O king, prosperity extending in all directions, and\nhigh success, and all the felicities of Heaven, thou hast won today. Do thou cast off this dog. In this there will be no\ncruelty.\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said, \u2018O thou of a 1,000 eyes. O thou that art of righteous behaviour, it is exceedingly difficult for\none that is of righteous behaviour to perpetrate an act that is unrighteous. I do not desire that union with prosperity\nfor which I shall have to cast off one that is devoted to me.\u2019\n\u201cIndra said, \u2018There is no place in Heaven for persons with dogs. Besides, the (deities called) Krodhavasas take\naway all the merits of such persons. Reflecting on this, act, O king Yudhishthira the just. Do thou abandon this dog.\nThere is no cruelty in this.\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira said, \u2018It has been said that the abandonment of one that is devoted is infinitely sinful. It is equal\nto the sin that one incurs by slaying a Brahmana. Hence, O great Indra, I shall not abandon this dog today from\ndesire of my happiness. Even this is my vow steadily pursued, that I never give up a person that is terrified, nor one\nthat is devoted to me, nor one that seeks my protection, saying that he is destitute, nor one that is afflicted, nor one\nthat has come to me, nor one that is weak in protecting oneself, nor one that is solicitous of life. I shall never give up\nsuch a one till my own life is at an end.\u2019\n\u201cIndra said, \u2018Whatever gifts, or sacrifices spread out, or libations poured on the sacred fire, are seen by a dog,\nare taken away by the Krodhavasas. Do thou, therefore, abandon this dog. By abandoning this dog thou wilt attain\nto the region of the deities. Having abandoned thy brothers and Krishna, thou hast, O hero, acquired a region of\nfelicity by thy own deeds. Why art thou so stupefied? Thou hast renounced everything. Why then dost thou not\nrenounce this dog?\u2019 \u201cYudhishthira said, \u2018This is well known in all the worlds that there is neither friendship nor en-\nmity with those that are dead. When my brothers and Krishna died, I was unable to revive them. Hence it was that\nI abandoned them. I did not, however, abandon them as long as they were alive. To frighten one that has sought\nprotection, the slaying of a woman, the theft of what belongs to a Brahmana, and injuring a friend, each of these\nfour, O Shakra, is I think equal to the abandonment of one that is devoted.\u2019\u201d\nVaishampayana continued: \u201cHearing these words of king Yudhishthira the just, (the dog became transformed\ninto) the deity of Righteousness, who, well pleased, said these words unto him in a sweet voice fraught with praise.\n\u201cDharma said: \u2018Thou art well born, O king of kings, and possessed of the intelligence and the good conduct of\nPandu. Thou hast compassion for all creatures, O Bharata, of which this is a bright example. Formerly, O son, thou\nwert once examined by me in the woods of Dwaita, where thy brothers of great prowess met with (an appearance\nof) death. Disregarding both thy brothers Bhima and Arjuna, thou didst wish for the revival of Nakula from thy\ndesire of doing good to thy (step-) mother. On the present occasion, thinking the dog to be devoted to thee, thou\nhast renounced the very car of the celestials instead of renouncing him. Hence. O king, there is no one in Heaven\nthat is equal to thee. Hence, O Bharata, regions of inexhaustible felicity are thine. Thou hast won them, O chief of\nthe Bharatas, and thine is a celestial and high goal.\u2019\u201d\nVaishampayana continued: \u201cThen Dharma, and Shakra, and the Maruts, and the Ashvinis, and other deities,\nand the celestial Rishis, causing Yudhishthira to ascend on a car, proceeded to Heaven. Those beings crowned with\nsuccess and capable of going everywhere at will, rode their respective cars. King Yudhishthira, that perpetuator of\nKuru\u2019s race, riding on that car, ascended quickly, causing the entire welkin to blaze with his effulgence. Then Nara-\nda, that foremost of all speakers, endued with penances, and conversant with all the worlds, from amidst that con-\ncourse of deities, said these words: \u2018All those royal sages that are here have their achievements transcended by those\nof Yudhishthira. Covering all the worlds by his fame and splendour and by his wealth of conduct, he has attained to\nHeaven in his own (human) body. None else than the son of Pandu has been heard to achieve this.\u2019\n\u201cHearing these words of Narada, the righteous-souled king, saluting the deities and all the royal sages there\npresent, said, \u2018Happy or miserable, whatever the region be that is now my brothers\u2019, I desire to proceed to. I do not\nwish to go anywhere else.\u2019\n\u201cHearing this speech of the king, the chief of the deities, Purandara, said these words fraught with noble sense:\n\u2018Do thou live in this place, O king of kings, which thou hast won by thy meritorious deeds. Why dost thou still\ncherish human affections? Thou hast attained to great success, the like of which no other man has ever been able to\nattain. Thy brothers, O delighter of the Kurus, have succeeded in winning regions of felicity. Human affections still\ntouch thee. This is Heaven. Behold these celestial Rishis and Siddhas who have attained to the region of the gods.\u2019\n529 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u201cGifted with great intelligence, Yudhishthira answered the chief of the deities once more, saying, \u2018O conqueror\nof Daityas, I venture not to dwell anywhere separated from them. I desire to go there, where my brothers have gone.\nI wish to go there where that foremost of women, Draupadi, of ample proportions and darkish complexion and\nendued with great intelligence and righteous of conduct, has gone.\u2019\u201d\nThe end of Mahaprasthanika-parva\nBook 18\nThe Last Illusions\nSection I\nOm! Having bowed down into Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as also to the goddess Sarasvati,\nshould the word \u201cJaya\u201d be uttered.\nJanamejaya said, \u201cHaving attained to Heaven, what regions were respectively attained by my grandsires of old,\nviz., the Pandavas and the sons of Dhritarashtra? I desire to hear this. I think that thou art conversant with every-\nthing, having been taught by the great Rishi Vyasa of wonderful feats.\nVaishampayana said, \u201cListen now to what thy grandsires, Yudhishthira and others, did after having attained to\nHeaven, that place of the deities. Arrived at Heaven, king Yudhishthira the just, beheld Duryodhana endued with\nprosperity and seated on an excellent seat. He blazed with effulgence like the sun and wore all those signs of glory\nwhich belong to heroes. And he was in the company of many deities of blazing effulgence and of Sadhyas of righ-\nteous deeds. Yudhishthira, beholding Duryodhana and his prosperity, became suddenly filled with rage and turned\nback from the sight.\n\u201cHe loudly addressed his companions, saying, \u2018I do not desire to share regions of felicity with Duryodhana who\nwas stained by cupidity and possessed of little foresight. It was for him that friends, and kinsmen, over the whole\nEarth were slaughtered by us whom he had afflicted greatly in the deep forest. It was for him that the virtuous prin-\ncess of Pancala, Draupadi of faultless features, our wife, was dragged into the midst of the assembly before all our\nseniors. Ye gods, I have no desire to even behold Suyodhana. I wish to go there where my brothers are.\u2019\n\u201cNarada, smiling, told him, \u2018It should not be so, O king of kings. While residing in Heaven, all enmities cease. O\nmighty-armed Yudhishthira, do not say so about king Duryodhana. Hear my words. Here is king Duryodhana. He\nis worshipped with the gods by those righteous men and those foremost of kings who are now denizens of Heaven.\nBy causing his body to be poured as a libation on the fire of battle, he has obtained the end that consists in attain-\nment of the region for heroes. You and your brothers, who were veritable gods on Earth, were always persecuted by\nthis one. Yet through his observance of Kshatriya practices he has attained to this region. This lord of Earth was not\nterrified in a situation fraught with terror.\n\u201c\u2018O son, thou shouldst not bear in mind the woes inflicted on thee on account of the match at dice. It behoveth\nthee not to remember the afflictions of Draupadi. It behoveth thee not to remember the other woes which were\nyours in consequence of the acts of your kinsmen,\u2014the woes, viz., that were due to battle or to other situations. Do\nthou meet Duryodhana now according to the ordinances of polite intercourse. This is Heaven, O lord of men. There\ncan be no enmities here.\u2019\n\u201cThough thus addressed by Narada, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, endued with great intelligence, enquired about\nhis brothers and said, \u2018If these eternal regions reserved for heroes be Duryodhana\u2019s, that unrighteous and sinful\nwight, that man who was the destroyer of friends and of the whole world, that man for whose sake the entire Earth\nwas devastated with all her horses and elephants and human beings, that wight for whose sake we were burnt with\nwrath in thinking of how best we might remedy our wrongs, I desire to see what regions have been attained by\nthose high-souled heroes, my brothers of high vows, steady achievers of promises, truthful in speech, and distin-\nguished for courage. The high-souled Karna, the son of Kunti, incapable of being baffled in battle, Dhrishtadyumna,\nSatyaki, the sons of Dhrishtadyumna and those other Kshatriyas who met with death in the observance of Ksha-\ntriya practices, where are those lords of Earth, O Brahmana? I do not see them here, O Narada. I desire to see, O\nNarada, Virata and Drupada and the other great Kshatriyas headed by Dhrishtaketu, as also Shikhandi, the Pancala\nprince, the sons of Draupadi, and Abhimanyu, irresistible in battle.\u2019\nSection II\n\u201cYudhishthira said, \u2018Ye deities, I do not see here Radha\u2019s son of immeasurable prowess, as also my high-souled\nbrothers, and Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas, those great car-warriors that poured their bodies (as libations) on the\nfire of battle, those kings and princes that met with death for my sake in battle. Where are those great car-warriors\nthat possessed the prowess of tigers? Have those foremost of men acquired this region? If those great car-warriors\nhave obtained these regions, then only do you know, ye gods, that I shall reside here with those high-souled ones.\n530 The Mahabharata\nIf this auspicious and eternal region has not been acquired by those kings, then know, ye gods, that without those\nbrothers and kinsmen of mine, I shall not live here. At the time of performing the water rites (after the battle), I\nheard my mother say, \u2018Do thou offer oblations of water unto Karna.\u2019 Since hearing those words of my mother, I\nam burning with grief. I grieve also incessantly at this, ye gods, that when I marked the resemblance between the\nfeet of my mother and those of Karna of immeasurable soul, I did not immediately place myself under orders of\nthat afflicter of hostile ranks. Ourselves joined with Karna, Shakra himself would have been unable to vanquish in\nbattle. Wherever may that child of Surya be, I desire to see him. Alas, his relationship with us being unknown, I\ncaused him to be slain by Arjuna. Bhima also of terrible prowess and dearer to me than my life-breaths, Arjuna too,\nresembling Indra himself, the twins also that resembled the Destroyer himself in prowess, I desire to behold. I wish\nto see the princess of Pancala, whose conduct was always righteous. I wish not to stay here. I tell you the truth. Ye\nforemost ones among the deities, what is Heaven to me if I am dissociated from my brothers? That is Heaven where\nthose brothers of mine are. This, in my opinion, is not Heaven.\u2019\n\u201cThe gods said, \u2018If thou longest to be there, go then, O son, without delay. At the command of the chief of the\ndeities, we are ready to do what is agreeable to thee.\u2019\nVaishampayana continued: Having said so, the gods then ordered the celestial messenger, O scorcher of foes,\nsaying, \u2018Do thou show unto Yudhishthira his friends and kinsmen.\u2019 Then the royal son of Kunti and the celestial\nmessenger proceeded together, O foremost of kings, to that place where those chiefs of men (whom Yudhishthi-\nra had wished to see) were. The celestial messenger proceeded first, the king followed him behind. The path was\ninauspicious and difficult and trodden by men of sinful deeds. It was enveloped in thick darkness, and covered\nwith hair and moss forming its grassy vesture. Polluted with the stench of sinners, and miry with flesh and blood,\nit abounded with gadflies and stinging bees and gnats and was endangered by the inroads of grisly bears. Rotting\ncorpses lay here and there. Overspread with bones and hair, it was noisome with worms and insects. It was skirted\nall along with a blazing fire. It was infested by crows and other birds and vultures, all having beaks of iron, as also\nby evil spirits with long mouths pointed like needles. And it abounded with inaccessible fastnesses like the Vindhya\nmountains. Human corpses were scattered over it, smeared with fat and blood, with arms and thighs cut off, or with\nentrails torn out and legs severed.\n\u201cAlong that path so disagreeable with the stench of corpses and awful with other incidents, the righteous-souled\nking proceeded, filled with diverse thoughts. He beheld a river full of boiling water and, therefore, difficult to cross,\nas also a forest of trees whose leaves were sharp swords and razors. There were plains full of fine white sand exceed-\ningly heated, and rocks and stones made of iron. There were many jars of iron all around, with boiling oil in them.\nMany a Kuta-salmalika was there, with sharp thorns and, therefore, exceedingly painful to the touch. The son of\nKunti beheld also the tortures inflicted upon sinful men.\n\u201cBeholding that inauspicious region abounding with every sort of foulness, Yudhishthira asked the celestial\nmessenger, saying, \u2018How far shall we proceed along a path like this? It behoveth thee to tell me where those brothers\nof mine are. I desire also to know what region is this of the gods?\u2019\n\u201cHearing these words of king Yudhishthira the just, the celestial messenger stopped in his course and replied,\nsaying, \u2018Thus far is your way. The denizens of Heaven commanded me that having come thus far, I am to stop. If\nthou art tired, O king of kings, thou mayst return with me.\u2019\n\u201cYudhishthira, however, was exceedingly disconsolate and stupefied by the foul odour. Resolved to return, O\nBharata, he retraced his steps. Afflicted by sorrow and grief, the righteous-souled monarch turned back. Just at that\nmoment he heard piteous lamentations all around, \u2018O son of Dharma, O royal sage, O thou of sacred origin, O son\nof Pandu, do thou stay a moment for favouring us. At thy approach, O invincible one, a delightful breeze hath be-\ngun to blow, bearing the sweet scent of thy person. Great hath been our relief at this. O foremost of kings, beholding\nthee, O first of men, great hath been our happiness. O son of Pritha, let that happiness last longer through thy stay\nhere, for a few moments more. Do thou remain here, O Bharata, for even a short while. As long as thou art here, O\nthou of Kuru\u2019s race, torments cease to afflict us.\u2019 These and many similar words, uttered in piteous voices by persons\nin pain, the king heard in that region, wafted to his ears from every side.\n\u201cHearing those words of beings in woe, Yudhishthira of compassionate heart exclaimed aloud, \u2018Alas, how pain-\nful!\u2019 And the king stood still. The speeches of those woe-begone and afflicted persons seemed to the son of Pandu to\nbe uttered in voices that he had heard before although he could not recognise them on that occasion.\n\u201cUnable to recognise voices, Dharma\u2019s son, Yudhishthira, enquired, saying, \u2018Who are you? Why also do you stay here?\u2019\n\u201cThus addressed, they answered him from all sides, saying, \u2018I am Karna!\u2019 \u2018I am Bhimasena!\u2019 \u2018I am Arjuna!\u2019 \u2018I\nam Nakula!\u2019 \u2018I am Sahadeva!\u2019 \u2018I am Dhrishtadyumna!\u2019 \u2018I am Draupadi!\u2019 \u2018We are the sons of Draupadi!\u2019 Even thus, O\nking, did those voices speak.\n\u201cHearing those exclamations, O king, uttered in voices of pain suitable to that place, the royal Yudhishthira\nasked himself \u2018What perverse destiny is this? What are those sinful acts which were committed by those high-\nsouled beings, Karna and the sons of Draupadi, and the slender-waisted princess of Pancala, so that their residence\n531 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nhas been assigned in this region of foetid smell and great woe? I am not aware of any transgression that can be\nattributed to these persons of righteous deeds. What is that act by doing which Dhritarashtra\u2019s son, king Suyodha-\nna, with all his sinful followers, has become invested with such prosperity? Endued with prosperity like that of the\ngreat Indra himself, he is highly adored. What is that act through the consequence of which these (high-souled\nones) have fallen into Hell? All of them were conversant with every duty, were heroes, were devoted to truth and the\nVedas; were observant of Kshatriya practices; were righteous in their acts; were performers of sacrifices; and givers\nof large presents unto brahmanas. Am I asleep or awake? Am I conscious or unconscious? Or, is all this a mental\ndelusion due to disorders of the brain?\u2019\n\u201cOverwhelmed by sorrow and grief, and with his senses agitated by anxiety, king Yudhishthira indulged in such\nreflections for a long time. The royal son of Dharma then gave way to great wrath. Indeed, Yudhishthira then cen-\nsured the gods, as also Dharma himself. Afflicted by the very foul odour, he addressed the celestial messenger, say-\ning, \u2018Return to the presence of those whose messenger thou art. Tell them that I shall not go back to where they are,\nbut shall stay even here, since, in consequence of my companionship, these afflicted brothers of mine have become\ncomforted.\u2019 Thus addressed by the intelligent son of Pandu, the celestial messenger returned to the place where the\nchief of the deities was, viz., he of a hundred sacrifices. He represented unto him the acts of Yudhishthira. Indeed, O\nruler of men, he informed Indra of all that Dharma\u2019s son had said!\nSection III\nVaishampayana said, \u201cKing Yudhishthira the just, the son of Pritha, had not stayed there for more than a mo-\nment when, O thou of Kuru\u2019s race, all the gods with Indra at their head came to that spot. The deity of Righteous-\nness in his embodied form also came to that place where the Kuru king was, for seeing that monarch. Upon the\nadvent of those deities of resplendent bodies and sanctified and noble deeds, the darkness that had overwhelmed\nthat region immediately disappeared. The torments undergone by beings of sinful deeds were no longer seen. The\nriver Vaitarani, the thorny Salmali, the iron jars, and the boulders of rock, so terrible to behold, also vanished\nfrom sight. The diverse repulsive corpses also, which the Kuru king had seen, disappeared at the same time. Then a\nbreeze, delicious and fraught with pleasant perfumes, perfectly pure and delightfully cool, O Bharata, began to blow\non that spot in consequence of the presence of the gods. The Maruts, with Indra, the Vasus with the twin Ashvinis,\nthe Sadhyas, the Rudras, the Adityas, and the other denizens of Heaven, as also the Siddhas and the great Rishis, all\ncame there where Dharma\u2019s royal son of great energy was.\n\u201cThen Shakra, the lord of the deities, endued with blazing prosperity, addressed Yudhishthira and comforting\nhim, said, \u2018O Yudhishthira of mighty arms, come, come, O chief of men. These illusions have ended, O puissant one.\nSuccess has been attained by thee, O mighty-armed one, and eternal regions (of felicity) have become thine. Thou\nshouldst not yield to wrath. Listen to these words of mine. Hell, O son, should without doubt be beheld by every\nking. Of both good and bad there is abundance, O chief of men. He who enjoys first the fruits of his good acts must\nafterwards endure Hell. He, on the other hand, who first endures Hell, must afterwards enjoy Heaven. He whose\nsinful acts are many enjoys Heaven first. It is for this, O king, that desirous of doing thee good, I caused thee to be\nsent for having a view of Hell. Thou hadst, by a pretence, deceived Drona in the matter of his son. Thou hast, in\nconsequence thereof, been shown Hell by an act of deception. After the manner of thyself, Bhima and Arjuna, and\nDraupadi, have all been shown the place of sinners by an act of deception. Come, O chief of men, all of them have\nbeen cleansed of their sins. All those kings who had aided thee and who have been slain in battle, have all attained\nto Heaven. Come and behold them, O foremost one of Bharata\u2019s race.\n\u201c\u2018Karna, the mighty bowman, that foremost of all wielders of weapons for whom thou art grieving, has also at-\ntained to high success. Behold, O puissant one, that foremost of men, viz., the son of Surya. He is in that place which\nis his own, O mighty-armed one. Kill this grief of thine, O chief of men. Behold thy brothers and others, those kings,\nthat is, who had espoused thy side. They have all attained to their respective places (of felicity). Let the fever of thy\nheart be dispelled. Having endured a little misery first, from this time, O son of Kuru\u2019s race, do thou sport with me\nin happiness, divested of grief and all thy ailments dispelled. O mighty-armed one, do thou now enjoy, O king, the\nrewards of all thy deeds of righteousness of those regions which thou hast acquired thyself by thy penances and of\nall thy gifts. Let deities and Gandharvas, and celestial Apsaras, decked in pure robes and excellent ornaments, wait\nupon and serve thee for thy happiness. Do thou, O mighty-armed one, enjoy now those regions (of felicity) which\nhave become thine through the Rajasuya sacrifice performed by thee and whose felicities have been enhanced by the\nsacrificial scimitar employed by thee. Let the high fruits of thy penances be enjoyed by thee. Thy regions, O Yud-\nhishthira, are above, those of kings. They are equal to those of Hariscandra, O son of Pritha. Come, and sport there in\nbliss. There where the royal sage Mandhatri is, there where king Bhagiratha is, there where Dushmanta\u2019s son Bharata\nis, there wilt thou sport in bliss. Here is the celestial river, sacred and sanctifying the three worlds. It is called Heaven-\nly Ganga. Plunging into it, thou wilt go to thy own regions. Having bathed in this stream, thou wilt be divested of thy\nhuman nature. Indeed, thy grief dispelled, thy ailments conquered, thou wilt be freed from all enmities.\u2019\n532 The Mahabharata\n\u201cWhile, O Kuru king, the chief of the gods was saying so unto Yudhishthira, the deity of Righteousness, in his em-\nbodied form, then addressed his own son and said, \u2018O king, I am greatly pleased, O thou of great wisdom, with thee, O\nson, by thy devotion to me, by thy truthfulness of speech, and forgiveness, and self-restraint. This, indeed, is the third\ntest, O king, to which I put thee. Thou art incapable, O son of Pritha, of being swerved from thy nature or reason. Be-\nfore this, I had examined thee in the Dwaita woods by my questions, when thou hadst come to that lake for recovering\na couple of fire sticks. Thou stoodst it well. Assuming the shape of a dog, I examined thee once more, O son, when thy\nbrothers with Draupadi had fallen down. This has been thy third test; thou hast expressed thy wish to stay at Hell for\nthe sake of thy brothers. Thou hast become cleansed, O highly blessed one. Purified of sin, be thou happy.\nO son of Pritha, thy brothers, O king, were not such as to deserve Hell. All this has been an illusion created by\nthe chief of the gods. Without doubt, all kings, O son, must once behold Hell. Hence hast thou for a little while been\nsubjected to this great affliction. O king, neither Arjuna, nor Bhima, nor any of those foremost of men, viz., the\ntwins, nor Karna, ever truthful in speech and possessed of great courage, could be deserving of Hell for a long time.\nThe princess Krishna too, O Yudhishthira, could not be deserving of that place of sinners. Come, come, O foremost\none of the Bharatas, behold Ganga who spreads her current over the three worlds.\u2019\n\u201cThus addressed, that royal sage, viz., thy grandsire, proceeded with Dharma and all the other gods. Having\nbathed in the celestial river Ganga, sacred and sanctifying and ever adored by the Rishis, he cast off his human\nbody. Assuming then a celestial form, king Yudhishthira the just, in consequence of that bath, became divested of\nall his enmities and grief. Surrounded by the deities, the Kuru king Yudhishthira then proceeded from that spot. He\nwas accompanied by Dharma, and the great Rishis uttered his praises. Indeed, he reached that place where those\nforemost of men, those heroes, viz., the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras, freed from (human) wrath, were enjoying\neach his respective status.\nSection IV\nVaishampayana said, \u201cKing Yudhishthira, thus praised by the gods, the Maruts and the Rishis, proceeded to\nthat place where those foremost ones of Kuru\u2019s race were. He beheld Govinda endued with his Brahma-form. It\nresembled that form of his which had been seen before and which, therefore, helped the recognition. Blazing forth\nin that form of his, he was adorned with celestial weapons, such as the terrible discus and others in their respective\nembodied forms. He was being adored by the heroic Phalguna, who also was endued with a blazing effulgence. The\nson of Kunti beheld the slayer of Madhu also in his own form. Those two foremost of Beings, adored by all the gods,\nbeholding Yudhishthira, received him with proper honours.\n\u201cIn another place, the delighter of the Kurus beheld Karna, that foremost one among all wielders of weapons,\nresembling a dozen Suryas in splendour. In another part he beheld Bhimasena of great puissance, sitting in the\nmidst of the Maruts, and endued with a blazing form. He was sitting by the side of the God of Wind in his embod-\nied form. Indeed, he was then in a celestial form endued with great beauty, and had attained to the highest success.\nIn place belonging to the Ashvinis, the delighter of the Kurus beheld Nakula and Sahadeva, each blazing with his\nown effulgence.\n\u201cHe also beheld the princess of Pancala, decked in garlands of lotuses. Having attained to Heaven, she was sitting\nthere, endued with a form possessed of solar splendour. King Yudhishthira suddenly wished to question her. Then the\nillustrious Indra, the chief of the gods, spoke to him, \u2018This one is Sree herself. It was for your sake that she took birth,\nas the daughter of Drupada, among human beings, issuing not from any mother\u2019s womb, O Yudhishthira, endued with\nagreeable perfume and capable of delighting the whole world. For your pleasure, she was created by the wielder of the\ntrident. She was born in the race of Drupada and was enjoyed by you all. These five highly blessed Gandharvas endued\nwith the effulgence of fire, and possessed of great energy, were, O king, the sons of Draupadi and yourself.\n\u201cBehold Dhritarashtra, the king of the Gandharvas, possessed of great wisdom. Know that this one was the\neldest brother of thy sire. This one is thy eldest brother, the son of Kunti, endued with effulgence of fire. The son of\nSurya, thy eldest brother, the foremost of men, even this one was known as the son of Radha. He moves in the com-\npany of Surya. Behold this foremost of Beings. Among the tribes of the Saddhyas, the gods, the Viswedevas, and\nthe Maruts, behold, O king of kings, the mighty car-warriors of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, viz., those heroes\nhaving Satyaki for their first, and those mighty ones among the Bhojas. Behold the son of Subhadra, invincible in\nbattle, now staying with Soma. Even he is the mighty bowman Abhimanyu, now endued with the gentle effulgence\nof the great luminary of the night. Here is the mighty bowman Pandu, now united with Kunti and Madri. Thy sire\nfrequently comes to me on his excellent car. Behold the royal Bhishma, the son of Santanu, now in the midst of the\nVasus. Know that this one by the side of Brihaspati is thy preceptor Drona. These and other kings, O son of Pandu,\nwho had warred on thy side now walk with the Gandharvas or Yakshas or other sacred beings. Some have attained\nto the status of Guhyakas, O king. Having cast off their bodies, they have conquered Heaven by the merit they had\nacquired through word, thought and deed.\u2019\n533 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSection V\nJanamejaya said, \u201cBhishma and Drona, those two high-souled persons, king Dhritarashtra, and Virata and\nDrupada, and Sankha and Uttara. Dhrishtaketu and Jayatsena and king Satyajit, the sons of Duryodhana, and\nShakuni the son of Subala, Karna\u2019s sons of great prowess, king Jayadratha, Ghatotkaca and others whom thou hast\nnot mentioned, the other heroic kings of blazing forms\u2014tell me for what period they remained in Heaven. O fore-\nmost of regenerate persons, was theirs an eternal place in Heaven? What was the end attained to by those foremost\nof men when their acts came to an end? I desire to hear this, O foremost of regenerate persons, and therefore have I\nasked thee. Through thy blazing penances thou seest all things.\nSauti said: Thus questioned, that regenerate Rishi, receiving the permission of the high-souled Vyasa, set him-\nself to answer the question of the king.\nVaishampayana said, \u201cEvery one, O king of men, is not capable of returning to his own nature at the end of his\ndeeds. Whether this is so or not, is, indeed a good question asked by thee. Hear, O king, this which is a mystery\nof the gods, O chief of Bharata\u2019s race. It was explained (to us) by Vyasa of mighty energy, celestial vision and great\nprowess, that ancient ascetic, O Kauravya, who is the son of Parasara and who always observes high vows, who is of\nimmeasurable understanding, who is omniscient, and who, therefore knows the end attached to all acts.\n\u201cBhishma of mighty energy and great effulgence attained to the status of the Vasus. Eight Vasus, O chief of\nBharata\u2019s race, are now seen. Drona entered into Brihaspati, that foremost one of Angirasa\u2019s descendants. Hridika\u2019s\nson Kritavarma entered the Maruts. Pradyumna entered Sanatkumara whence he had issued. Dhritarashtra ob-\ntained the regions, so difficult of acquisition, that belong to the Lord of treasures. The famous Gandhari obtained\nthe same regions with her husband Dhritarashtra. With his two wives, Pandu proceeded to the abode of the great\nIndra. Both Virata and Drupada, the king Dhrishtaketu, as also Nishatha, Akrura, Samva, Bhanukampa, and Vidu-\nratha, and Bhurishrava and Sala and king Bhuri, and Kansa, and Ugrasena, and Vasudeva, and Uttara, that foremost\nof men, with his brother Sankha\u2014all these foremost of persons entered the deities. Soma\u2019s son of great prowess,\nnamed Varchas of mighty energy, became Abhimanyu, the son of Phalguna, that lion among men. Having fought,\nagreeably to Kshatriya practices, with bravery such as none else had ever been able to show, that mighty-armed and\nrighteous-souled being entered Soma. Slain on the field of battle, O foremost of men, Karna entered Surya. Shakuni\nobtained absorption into Dwapara, and Dhrishtadyumna into the deity of fire. The sons of Dhritarashtra were all\nRakshasas of fierce might. Sanctified by death caused by weapons, those high-souled beings of prosperity all suc-\nceeded in attaining to Heaven. Both Kshattri and king Yudhishthira entered into the god of Righteousness. The holy\nand illustrious Ananta (who had taken birth as Balarama) proceeded to the region below the Earth. Through the\ncommand of the Grandsire, he, aided by his Yoga power, supported the Earth. Vasudeva was a portion of that eter-\nnal god of gods called Narayana. Accordingly, he entered into Narayana. 16,000 women had been married to Va-\nsudeva as his wives. When the time came, O Janamejaya, they, plunged into the Sarasvati. Casting off their (human)\nbodies there, they re-ascended to Heaven. Transformed into Apsaras, they approached the presence of Vasudeva.\nThose heroic and mighty car-warriors, Ghatotkaca and others, who were slain in the great battle, attained to the\nstatus, some of gods and some of Yakshas. Those that had fought on the side of Duryodhana are said to have been\nRakshasas. Gradually, O king, they have all attained to excellent regions of felicity. Those foremost of men have pro-\nceeded, some to the abode of Indra, some to that of Kuvera of great intelligence, and some to that of Varuna. I have\nnow told thee, O thou of great splendour, everything about the acts, O Bharata, of both the Kurus and the Pandavas.\nSauti said: Hearing this, ye foremost of regenerate ones, at the intervals of sacrificial rites, king Janamejaya\nbecame filled with wonder. The sacrificial priests then finished the rites that remained to be gone through. Astika,\nhaving rescued the snakes (from fiery death), became filled with joy. King Janamejaya then gratified all the Brah-\nmanas with copious presents. Thus worshipped by the king, they returned to their respective abodes. Having dis-\nmissed those learned Brahmanas, king Janamejaya came back from Takshasila to the city named after the elephant.\nI have now told everything that Vaishampayana narrated, at the command of Vyasa, unto the king at his snake\nsacrifice. Called a history, it is sacred, sanctifying and excellent. It has been composed by the ascetic Krishna, O\nBrahmana, of truthful speech. He is omniscient, conversant with all ordinances, possessed of a knowledge of all\nduties, endued with piety, capable of perceiving what is beyond the ken of the senses, pure, having a soul cleansed\nby penances, possessed of the six high attributes, and devoted to Sankhya Yoga. He has composed this, beholding\neverything with a celestial eye that has been cleansed (strengthened) by varied lore. He has done this, desiring to\nspread the fame, throughout the world, of the high-souled Pandavas, as also of other Kshatriyas possessed of abun-\ndant wealth of energy.\nThat learned man who recites this history of sacred days in the midst of a listening auditory becomes cleansed\nof every sin, conquers Heaven, and attains to the status of Brahma. Of that man who listens with rapt attention to\nthe recitation of the whole of this Veda composed by (the Island-born) Krishna, a million sins, numbering such\ngrave ones as Brahmanicide and the rest, are washed off. The Pitris of that man who recites even a small portion of\nthis history at a Sraddha, obtain inexhaustible food and drink. The sins that one commits during the day by one\u2019s\n534 The Mahabharata\nsenses or the mind are all washed off before evening by reciting a portion of the Mahabharata. Whatever sins a\nBrahmana may commit at night in the midst of women are all washed off before dawn by reciting a portion of the\nMahabharata.\nThe high race of the Bharatas is its topic. Hence it is called Bharata. And because of its grave import, as also\nof the Bharatas being its topic, it is called Mahabharata. He who is versed in interpretations of this great treatise,\nbecomes cleansed of every sin. Such a man lives in righteousness, wealth, and pleasure, and attains to Emancipation\nalso, O chief of Bharata\u2019s race.\nThat which occurs here occurs elsewhere. That which does not occur here occurs nowhere else. This history is\nknown by the name of Jaya. It should be heard by every one desirous of Emancipation. It should be read by Brahmanas,\nby kings, and by women quick with children. He that desires Heaven attains to Heaven; and he that desires victory\nattains to victory. The woman quick with child gets either a son or a daughter highly blessed. The puissant Island-born\nKrishna, who will not have to come back, and who is Emancipation incarnate, made an abstract of the Bharata, moved\nby the desire of aiding the cause of righteousness. He made another compilation consisting of sixty lakhs of verses. Thir-\nty lakhs of these were placed in the region of the deities. In the region of the Pitris fifteen lakhs, it should be known, are\ncurrent; while in that of the Yakshas fourteen lakhs are in vogue. One lakh is current among human beings.\nNarada recited the Mahabharata to the gods; Asita-Devala to the Pitris; Suka to the Rakshasas and the Yak-\nshas; and Vaishampayana to human beings. This history is sacred, and of high import, and regarded as equal to the\nVedas. That man, O Saunaka, who hears this history, placing a Brahmana before him, acquires both fame and the\nfruition of all his wishes. He who, with fervid devotion, listens to a recitation of the Mahabharata, attains (hereaf-\nter) to high success in consequence of the merit that becomes his through understanding even a very small portion\nthereof. All the sins of that man who recites or listens to this history with devotion are washed off.\nIn former times, the great Rishi Vyasa, having composed this treatise, caused his son Suka to read it with him,\nalong with these four Verses. \u2014Thousands of mothers and fathers, and hundreds of sons and wives arise in the\nworld and depart from it. Others will (arise and) similarly depart. There are thousands of occasions for joy and\nhundreds of occasions for fear. These affect only him that is ignorant but never him that is wise. With uplifted arms\nI am crying aloud but nobody hears me. From Righteousness is Wealth as also Pleasure. Why should not Righ-\nteousness, therefore, be courted? For the sake neither of pleasure, nor of fear, nor of cupidity should any one cast\noff Righteousness. Indeed, for the sake of even life one should not cast off Righteousness. Righteousness is eternal.\nPleasure and Pain are not eternal. Jiva is eternal. The cause, however, of Jiva\u2019s being invested with a body is not so.\nThat man who, waking up at dawn, reads this Savittri of the Bharata, acquires all the rewards attached to a rec-\nitation of this history and ultimately attains to the highest Brahma. As the sacred Ocean, as the Himavat mountain,\nare both regarded as mines of precious gems, even so is this Bharata (regarded as a mine of precious gems). The\nman of learning, by reciting to others this Veda or Agama composed by (the Island-born) Krishna, earns wealth.\nThere is no doubt in this that he who, with rapt attention, recites this history called Bharata, attains to high success.\nWhat need has that man of a sprinkling of the waters of Pushkara who attentively listens to this Bharata, while it is\nrecited to him? It represents the nectar that fell from the lips of the Island-born. It is immeasurable, sacred, sancti-\nfying, sin-cleansing, and auspicious.\nTHE r\u00e2M\u00e2yAnA\nAttributed to Valmiki\nWritten version composed in the fourth century B.C.E.\nIndia\nThe Ramayana is the story of Rama, who is the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu. In times of trouble, Vishnu\nsends down a human avatar to defeat evil; the avatar, therefore, is the embodiment (literally) of divine intervention.\nRama has the opportunity to fight evil when his wife, Sita, is kidnapped by the demon Ravana. Sita is the avatar of\nthe goddess Lakshmi, wife of Vishnu, and her human incarnation is identified as the daughter of the earth goddess,\nsince she was found in a plowed field by King Janaka (her name means \u201cfurrow\u201d). When Rama and his brothers\nrescue Sita, they have the help of one of the most popular figures in Indian mythology: the monkey god Hanuman,\nwho is the eleventh avatar of Shiva, and whose monkey incarnation is the son of the wind god Vayu. The action that\nfollows is in keeping with the divine nature and power of the characters.\nWritten by Laura J.

For this reason,\nRavana, the demon god of Ceylon, stood on his head in the midst of five fires for ten thousand years, and at the end\nof that time boldly demanded of Brahma as a reward that he should not be slain by gods, demons, or genii. He also\nrequested the gift of nine other heads and eighteen additional arms and hands.\nThese having been granted, he began by the aid of his evil spirits, the Rakshasas, to lay waste the earth and to do\nviolence to the good, especially to the priests.\nAt the time when Ravana\u2019s outrages were spreading terror throughout the land, and Brahma, looking down\nfrom his throne, shuddered to see the monster he had gifted with such fell power, there reigned in Ayodhya, now\nthe city of Oude, a good and wise raja, Dasaratha, who had reigned over the splendid city for nine thousand years\nwithout once growing weary. He had but one grief,\u2014that he was childless,\u2014and at the opening of the story he was\npreparing to make the great sacrifice, Asva-medha, to propitiate the gods, that they might give him a son.\nThe gods, well pleased, bore his request to Brahma in person, and incidentally preferred a request that he\nprovide some means of destroying the monster Ravana that was working such woe among their priests, and dis-\nturbing their sacrifices.\nBrahma granted the first request, and, cudgeling his brains for a\ndevice to destroy Ravana, bethought himself that while he had prom-\nised that neither gods, genii, nor demons should slay him, he had said\nnothing of man. He accordingly led the appealing gods to Vishnu,\nwho proclaimed that the monster should be slain by men and mon-\nkeys, and that he would himself be re-incarnated as the eldest son of\nDasaratha and in this form compass the death of Ravana.\nIn course of time, as a reward for his performance of the great\nsacrifice, four sons were born to Dasaratha, Rama by Kausalya, his\noldest wife, Bharata, whose mother was Kaikeyi, and twin sons,\nLakshmana and Satrughna, whose mother was Sumitra.

When he\npresented himself at court Janaka was at once won by his youth and beauty; and when the mighty bow, resting upon\nan eight-wheeled car, was drawn in by five thousand men, and Rama without apparent effort bent it until it broke,\nhe gladly gave him his beautiful daughter, and after the splendid wedding ceremonies were over, loaded the happy\npair with presents to carry back to Ayodhya.\nWhen Dasaratha, who had attended the marriage of his son at Mithila, returned home, he began to feel weary of\nreigning, and bethought himself of the ancient Hindu custom of making the eldest son and heir apparent a Yuva-Raja,\u2014\nthat is appointing him assistant king. Rama deserved this honor, and would, moreover, be of great assistance to him.\nHis happy people received the announcement of his intention with delight; the priests approved of it as well,\nand the whole city was in the midst of the most splendid preparations for the ceremony, when it occurred to\nDasaratha that all he lacked was the congratulations of his youngest and favorite wife, Kaikeyi, on this great event.\nThe well-watered streets and the garlanded houses had already aroused the suspicions of Kaikeyi,\u2014suspicions\nspeedily confirmed by the report of her maid. Angered and jealous because the son of Kausalya and not her darling\nBharata, at that time absent from the city, was to be made Yuva-Raja, she fled to the \u201cChamber of Sorrows,\u201d and was\nthere found by the old Raja.\n536 The R\u00e2m\u00e2yana\nThough Kaikeyi was his youngest and most beautiful wife, her tears, threats, and entreaties would have been\nof no avail had she not recalled that, months before, the old Raja, in gratitude for her devoted nursing during his\nillness, had granted her two promises. She now demanded the fulfilment of these before she would consent to smile\nupon him, and the consent won, she required him, first, to appoint Bharata Yuva-Raja; and, second, to exile Rama\nfor fourteen years to the terrible forest of Dandaka.\nThe promise of a Hindu, once given, cannot be revoked. In spite of the grief of the old Raja, of Kausalya, his old\nwife, and of all the people, who were at the point of revolt at the sudden disgrace of their favorite prince, the terrible\nnews was announced to Rama, and he declared himself ready to go, to save his father from dishonor.\nHe purposed to go alone, but Sita would not suffer herself to be thus deserted. Life without him, she pleaded,\nwas worse than death; and so eloquent was her grief at the thought of parting that she was at last permitted to don\nthe rough garment of bark provided by the malicious Kaikeyi.\nThe people of Ayodhya, determined to share the fate of their favorites, accompanied them from the city, their\ntears laying the dust raised by Rama\u2019s chariot wheels. But when sleep overcame them, Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana\nescaped from them, dismissed their charioteer, and, crossing the Ganges, made their way to the mountain of Ci-\ntra-kuta, where they took up their abode.\nNo more beautiful place could be imagined. Flowers of every kind, delicious fruits, and on every side the most\npleasing prospects, together with perfect love, made their hermitage a paradise on earth. Here the exiles led an\nidyllic existence until sought out by Bharata, who, learning from his mother on his return home the ruin she had\nwrought in the Raj, had indignantly spurned her, and hastened to Dandaka. The old Raja had died from grief soon\nafter the departure of the exiles, and Bharata now demanded that Rama should return to Ayodhya and become\nRaja, as was his right, as eldest son.\nWhen Rama refused to do this until the end of his fourteen years of exile, Bharata vowed that for fourteen years\nhe would wear the garb of a devotee and live outside the city, committing the management of the Raj to a pair of\ngolden sandals which he took from Rama\u2019s feet. All the affairs of state would be transacted under the authority of\nthe sandals, and Bharata, while ruling the Raj, would pay homage to them.\nSoon after the departure of Bharata the exiles were warned to depart from their home on Citra-kuta and seek\na safer hermitage, for terrible rakshasas filled this part of the forest. They accordingly sought the abode of Atri the\nhermit, whose wife Anasuya was so pleased with Sita\u2019s piety and devotion to her husband that she bestowed upon\nher the crown of immortal youth and beauty. They soon found a new abode in the forest of Pancarati, on the banks\nof the river Godavari, where Lakshmana erected a spacious bamboo house.\nTheir happiness in this elysian spot was destined to be short-lived. Near them dwelt a horrible rakshasa,\nSurpanakha by name, who fell in love with Rama. When she found that he did not admire the beautiful form she\nassumed to win him, and that both he and Lakshmana laughed at her advances, she attempted to destroy Sita, only\nto receive in the attempt a disfiguring wound from the watchful Lakshmana. Desiring revenge for her disfigured\ncountenance and her scorned love, she hastened to the court of her brother Ravana, in Ceylon, and in order to\ninduce him to avenge her wrongs, dwelt upon the charms of the beautiful wife of Rama.\nSome days after, Sita espied a golden fawn, flecked with silver, among the trees near their home. Its shining\nbody, its jewel-like horns, so captivated her fancy that she implored Rama, if possible, to take it alive for her; if\nnot, at least to bring her its skin for a couch. As Rama departed, he warned Lakshmana not to leave Sita for one\nmoment; he would surely return, since no weapon could harm him. In the depths of the forest the fawn fell by his\narrow, crying as it fell, \u201cO Sita! O Lakshmana!\u201d in Rama\u2019s very tones.\nWhen Sita heard the cry she reproached Lakshmana for not going to his brother\u2019s aid, until he left her to escape\nher bitter words. He had no sooner disappeared in the direction of the cry than a hermit appeared and asked her to\nminister unto his wants.\nSita carried him food, bathed his feet, and conversed with him until, able no longer to conceal his admiration\nfor her, he revealed himself in his true form as the demon god of Ceylon.\nWhen she indignantly repulsed him he seized her, and mounting his chariot drove rapidly towards Ceylon.\nWhen Rama and Lakshmana returned home, soon after, they found the house empty. As they searched through\nthe forest for traces of her they found a giant vulture dying from wounds received while endeavoring to rescue the\nshrieking Sita. Going farther, they encountered the monkey king Sugriva and his chiefs, among whom Sita had\ndropped from the chariot her scarf and ornaments.\nSugriva had been deposed from his kingdom by his brother Bali, who had also taken his wife from him. Rama\nagreed to conquer Bali if Sugriva would assist in the search for Sita; and, the agreement made, they at once marched\nupon Kishkindha, together slew Bali, and gained possession of the wealthy city and the queen Tara. They were now\nready to search for the lost Sita.\nIn his quest through every land, Hanuman, the monkey general, learned from the king of the vultures that she\nhad been carried to Ceylon. He immediately set out for the coast with his army, only to find a bridgeless ocean\n537 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nstretching between them and the island. Commanding his soldiers to remain where they were, Hanuman expanded\nhis body to enormous proportions, leaped the vast expanse of water, and alighted upon a mountain, from which\nhe could look down upon Lanka, the capital city of Ceylon. Perceiving the city to be closely guarded, he assumed\nthe form of a cat, and thus, unsuspected, crept through the barriers and examined the city. He found the demon\ngod in his apartments, surrounded by beautiful women, but Sita was not among them. Continuing his search, he at\nlast discovered her, her beauty dimmed by grief, seated under a tree in a beautiful asoka grove, guarded by hideous\nrakshasas with the faces of buffaloes, dogs, and swine.\nAssuming the form of a tiny monkey, Hanuman crept down the tree, and giving her the ring of Rama, took\none from her. He offered to carry her away with him, but Sita declared that Rama must himself come to her res-\ncue. While they were talking together, the demon god appeared, and, after fruitless wooing, announced that if Sita\ndid not yield herself to him in two months he would have her guards \u201cmince her limbs with steel\u201d for his morning\nrepast.\nIn his rage, Hanuman destroyed a mango grove and was captured by the demon\u2019s guards, who were ordered to\nset his tail on fire. As soon as this was done, Hanuman made himself so small that he slipped from his bonds, and,\njumping upon the roofs, spread a conflagration through the city of Lanka.\nHe leaped back to the mainland, conveyed the news of Sita\u2019s captivity to Rama and Sugriva, and was soon en-\ngaged in active preparations for the campaign.\nAs long as the ocean was unbridged it was impossible for any one save Hanuman to cross it. In his anger at be-\ning so thwarted, Rama turned his weapons against it, until from the terrified waves rose the god of the ocean, who\npromised him that if Nala built a bridge, the waves should support the materials as firmly as though it were built on\nland.\nTerror reigned in Lanka at the news of the approach of Rama. Vibishana, Ravana\u2019s brother, deserted to Rama,\nbecause of the demon\u2019s rage when he advised him to make peace with Rama. Fiercely fought battles ensued, in\nwhich even the gods took part, Vishnu and Indra taking sides with Rama, and the evil spirits fighting with Ravana.\nAfter the war had been carried on for some time, with varying results, it was decided to determine it by single\ncombat between Ravana and Rama. Then even the gods were terrified at the fierceness of the conflict. At each shot\nRama\u2019s mighty bow cut off a head of the demon, which at once grew back, and the hero was in despair until he\nremembered the all-powerful arrow given him by Brahma.\nAs the demon fell by this weapon, flowers rained from heaven upon the happy victor, and his ears were ravished\nwith celestial music.\nTouched by the grief of Ravana\u2019s widows, Rama ordered his foe a splendid funeral, and then sought the con-\nquered city.\nSita was led forth, beaming with happiness at finding herself re-united to her husband; but her happiness was\ndestined to be of short duration. Rama received her with coldness and with downcast eyes, saying that she could no\nlonger be his wife, after having dwelt in the zenana of the demon. Sita assured him of her innocence; but on his con-\ntinuing to revile her, she ordered her funeral pyre to be built, since she would rather die by fire than live despised by\nRama. The sympathy of all the bystanders was with Sita, but Rama saw her enter the flames without a tremor. Soon\nAgni, the god of fire, appeared, bearing the uninjured Sita in his arms. Her innocence thus publicly proved by the\ntrial by fire, she was welcomed by Rama, whose treatment she tenderly forgave.\nThe conquest made, the demon destroyed, and Sita restored, Rama returned in triumph to Ayodhya, and\nassumed the government. The city was prosperous, the people were happy, and for a time all went well. It was not\nlong, however, before whispers concerning Sita\u2019s long abode in Ceylon spread abroad, and some one whispered to\nRama that a famine in the country was due to the guilt of Sita, who had suffered the caresses of the demon while in\ncaptivity in Ceylon. Forgetful of the trial by fire, forgetful of Sita\u2019s devotion to him through weal and woe, the un-\ngrateful Rama immediately ordered her to the forest in which they had spent together the happy years of their exile.\nWithout a murmur the unhappy Sita, alone and unbefriended, dragged herself to the forest, and, torn with grief\nof body and spirit, found the hermitage of Valmiki, where she gave birth to twin sons, Lava and Ku\u00e7a. Here she\nreared them, with the assistance of the hermit, who was their teacher, and under whose care they grew to manhood,\nhandsome and strong.\nIt chanced about the time the youths were twenty years old, that Rama, who had grown peevish and disagree-\nable with age, began to think the gods were angered with him because he had killed Ravana, who was the son of a\nBrahman. Determined to propitiate them by means of the great sacrifice, he caused a horse to be turned loose in the\nforest. When his men went to retake it, at the end of the year, it was caught by two strong and beautiful youths who\nresisted all efforts to capture them. In his rage Rama went to the forest in person, only to learn that the youths were\nhis twin sons, Lava and Ku\u00e7a. Struck with remorse, Rama recalled the sufferings of his wife Sita, and on learning\nthat she was at the hermitage of Valmiki, ordered her to come to him, that he might take her to him again, having\nfirst caused her to endure the trial by fire to prove her innocence to all his court.\n538 The R\u00e2m\u00e2yana\nSita had had time to recover from the love of her youth, and the prospect of life with Rama, without the couleur\nde rose of youthful love, was not altogether pleasant. At first, she even refused to see him; but finally, moved by the\nappeals of Valmiki and his wife, she clad herself in her richest robes, and, young and beautiful as when first won by\nRama, she stood before him. Not deigning to look in his face, she appealed to the earth. If she had never loved any\nman but Rama, if her truth and purity were known to the earth, let it open its bosom and take her to it. While the\narmies stood trembling with horror, the earth opened, a gorgeous throne appeared, and the goddess of earth, seated\nupon it, took Sita beside her and conveyed her to the realms of eternal happiness, leaving the too late repentant\nRama to wear out his remaining years in shame and penitence.\n[The first selection covers Rama\u2019s sudden exile, with the reactions of those around him.]\nBook II\nLicense: Public Domain\nTranslated by Ralph T.

Her lord\u2019s address\nThe lady heard with deep distress,\nAnd, as the tear bedimmed her eye,\n552 The R\u00e2m\u00e2yana\nIn soft low accents made reply:\n\u201cThe perils of the wood, and all 5\nThe woes thou countest to appal,\nLed by my love I deem not pain;\nEach woe a charm, each loss a gain.\nTiger, and elephant, and deer,\nBull, lion, buffalo, in fear, 10\nSoon as thy matchless form they see,\nWith every silvan beast will flee.\nWith thee, O R\u00e1ma, I must go:\nMy sire\u2019s command ordains it so.\nBereft of thee, my lonely heart 15\nMust break, and life and I must part.\nWhile thou, O mighty lord, art nigh,\nNot even He who rules the sky,\nThough He is strongest of the strong,\nWith all his might can do me wrong. 20\nNor can a lonely woman left\nBy her dear husband live bereft.\nIn my great love, my lord, I ween,\nThe truth of this thou mayst have seen.\nIn my sire\u2019s palace long ago 25\nI heard the chief of those who know,\nThe truth-declaring Br\u00e1hmans, tell\nMy fortune, in the wood to dwell.\nI heard their promise who divine\nThe future by each mark and sign, 30\nAnd from that hour have longed to lead\nThe forest life their lips decreed.\nNow, mighty R\u00e1ma, I must share\nThy father\u2019s doom which sends thee there;\nIn this I will not be denied, 35\nBut follow, love, where thou shalt guide.\nO husband, I will go with thee,\nObedient to that high decree.\nNow let the Br\u00e1hmans\u2019 words be true,\nFor this the time they had in view. 40\nI know full well the wood has woes;\nBut they disturb the lives of those\nWho in the forest dwell, nor hold\nTheir rebel senses well controlled.\nIn my sire\u2019s halls, ere I was wed, 45\nI heard a dame who begged her bread\nBefore my mother\u2019s face relate\nWhat griefs a forest life await.\nAnd many a time in sport I prayed\nTo seek with thee the greenwood shade, 50\nFor O, my heart on this is set,\nTo follow thee, dear anchoret.\nMay blessings on thy life attend:\nI long with thee my steps to bend,\nFor with such hero as thou art 55\nThis pilgrimage enchants my heart.\nStill close, my lord, to thy dear side\nMy spirit will be purified:\nLove from all sin my soul will free:\nMy husband is a God to me. 60\n553 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSo, love, with thee shall I have bliss\nAnd share the life that follows this.\nI heard a Br\u00e1hman, dear to fame,\nThis ancient Scripture text proclaim:\n\u201cThe woman whom on earth below 65\nHer parents on a man bestow,\nAnd lawfully their hands unite\nWith water and each holy rite,\nShe in this world shall be his wife,\nHis also in the after life.\u201d 70\nThen tell me, O beloved, why\nThou wilt this earnest prayer deny,\nNor take me with thee to the wood,\nThine own dear wife so true and good.\nBut if thou wilt not take me there 75\nThus grieving in my wild despair,\nTo fire or water I will fly,\nOr to the poisoned draught, and die.\u201d\nSo thus to share his exile, she\nBesought him with each earnest plea, 80\nNor could she yet her lord persuade\nTo take her to the lonely shade.\nThe answer of the strong-armed chief\nSmote the Videhan\u2019s soul with grief,\nAnd from her eyes the torrents came 85\nbathing the bosom of the dame.\nCanto XXX.

faultless mould, 5\nWith glossy skin like polished gold.\nAnd loudly to her husband cried\nAnd bow-armed Lakshma\u1e47 by his side:\nAgain, again she called in glee:\n\u201cO come this glorious creature see; 10\nQuick, quick, my lord, this deer to view.\nAnd bring thy brother Lakshma\u1e47 too.\u201d\nAs through the wood her clear tones rang,\nSwift to her side the brothers sprang.\nWith eager eyes the grove they scanned, 15\nAnd saw the deer before them stand.\nBut doubt was strong in Lakshma\u1e47\u2019s breast,\nWho thus his thought and fear expressed:\n\u201cStay, for the wondrous deer we see\nThe fiend M\u00e1r\u00edcha\u2019s self may be. 20\nEre now have kings who sought this place\nTo take their pastime in the chase,\nMet from his wicked art defeat,\nAnd fallen slain by like deceit.\nHe wears, well trained in magic guile, 25\nThe figure of a deer a while,\nBright as the very sun, or place\nWhere dwell the gay Gandharva race.\nNo deer, O R\u00e1ma, e\u2019er was seen\nThus decked with gold and jewels\u2019 sheen. 30\n\u2018Tis magic, for the world has ne\u2019er,\nLord of the world, shown aught so fair.\u201d\nBut S\u00edt\u00e1 of the lovely smile,\nA captive to the giant\u2019s wile,\nTurned Lakshma\u1e47\u2019s prudent speech aside 35\nAnd thus with eager words replied:\n\u201cMy honoured lord, this deer I see\nWith beauty rare enraptures me.\nGo, chief of mighty arm, and bring\nFor my delight this precious thing. 40\nFair creatures of the woodland roam\nUntroubled near our hermit home.\nThe forest cow and stag are there,\nThe fawn, the monkey, and the bear,\nWhere spotted deer delight to play, 45\nAnd strong and beauteous Kinnars stray.\nBut never, as they wandered by,\nHas such a beauty charmed mine eye\nAs this with limbs so fair and slight,\nSo gentle, beautiful and bright. 50\nO see, how fair it is to view\nWith jewels of each varied hue:\nBright as the rising moon it glows,\nLighting the wood where\u2019er it goes.\n563 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAh me, what form and grace are there! 55\nIts limbs how fine, its hues how fair!\nTranscending all that words express,\nIt takes my soul with loveliness.\nO, if thou would, to please me, strive\nTo take the beauteous thing alive, 60\nHow thou wouldst gaze with wondering eyes\nDelighted on the lovely prize!\nAnd when our woodland life is o\u2019er,\nAnd we enjoy our realm once more,\nThe wondrous animal will grace 65\nThe chambers of my dwelling-place,\nAnd a dear treasure will it be\nTo Bharat and the queens and me,\nAnd all with rapture and amaze\nUpon its heavenly form will gaze. 70\nBut if the beauteous deer, pursued,\nThine arts to take it still elude,\nStrike it, O chieftain, and the skin\nWill be a treasure, laid within.\nO, how I long my time to pass 75\nSitting upon the tender grass,\nWith that soft fell beneath me spread\nBright with its hair of golden thread!\nThis strong desire, this eager will,\nBefits a gentle lady ill: 80\nBut when I first beheld, its look\nMy breast with fascination took.\nSee, golden hair its flank adorns,\nAnd sapphires tip its branching horns.\nResplendent as the lunar way, 85\nOr the first blush of opening day,\nWith graceful form and radiant hue\nIt charmed thy heart, O chieftain, too.\u201d\nHe heard her speech with willing ear,\nHe looked again upon the deer. 90\nIts lovely shape his breast beguiled\nMoved by the prayer of Janak\u2019s child,\nAnd yielding for her pleasure\u2019s sake,\nTo Lakshma\u1e47 R\u00e1ma turned and spake:\n\u201cMark, Lakshma\u1e47, mark how S\u00edt\u00e1\u2019s breast 95\nWith eager longing is possessed.\nTo-day this deer of wondrous breed\nMust for his passing beauty bleed,\nBrighter than e\u2019er in Nandan strayed,\nOr Chaitraratha\u2019s heavenly shade. 100\nHow should the groves of earth possess\nSuch all-surpassing loveliness!\nThe hair lies smooth and bright and fine,\nOr waves upon each curving line,\nAnd drops of living gold bedeck 105\nThe beauty of his side and neck.\nO look, his crimson tongue between\nHis teeth like flaming fire is seen,\nFlashing, whene\u2019er his lips he parts,\n564 The R\u00e2m\u00e2yana\nAs from a cloud the lightning darts. 110\nO see his sunlike forehead shine\nWith emerald tints and almandine,\nWhile pearly light and roseate glow\nOf shells adorn his neck below.\nNo eye on such a deer can rest 115\nBut soft enchantment takes the breast:\nNo man so fair a thing behold\nAblaze with light of radiant gold,\nCelestial, bright with jewels\u2019 sheen,\nNor marvel when his eyes have seen. 120\nA king equipped with bow and shaft\nDelights in gentle forest craft,\nAnd as in boundless woods he strays\nThe quarry for the venison slays.\nThere as he wanders with his train 125\nA store of wealth he oft may gain.\nHe claims by right the precious ore,\nHe claims the jewels\u2019 sparkling store.\nSuch gains are dearer in his eyes\nThan wealth that in his chamber lies, 130\nThe dearest things his spirit knows,\nDear as the bliss which \u015aukra chose.\nBut oft the rich expected gain\nWhich heedless men pursue in vain,\nThe sage, who prudent counsels know, 135\nExplain and in a moment show.\nThis best of deer, this gem of all,\nTo yield his precious spoils must fall,\nAnd tender S\u00edt\u00e1 by my side\nShall sit upon the golden hide. 140\nNe\u2019er could I find so rich a coat\nOn spotted deer or sheep or goat.\nNo buck or antelope has such,\nSo bright to view, so soft to touch.\nThis radiant deer and one on high 145\nThat moves in glory through the sky,\nAlike in heavenly beauty are,\nOne on the earth and one a star.\nBut, brother, if thy fears be true,\nAnd this bright creature that we view 150\nBe fierce M\u00e1r\u00edcha in disguise,\nThen by this hand he surely dies.\nFor that dire fiend who spurns control\nWith bloody hand and cruel soul,\nHas roamed this forest and dismayed 155\nThe holiest saints who haunt the shade.\nGreat archers, sprung of royal race,\nPursuing in the wood the chase,\nHave fallen by his wicked art,\nAnd now my shaft shall strike his heart. 160\nVat\u00e1pi, by his magic power\nMade heedless saints his flesh devour,\nThen, from within their frames he rent\nForth bursting from imprisonment.\nBut once his art in senseless pride 165\nUpon the mightiest saint he tried,\n565 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAgastya\u2019s self, and caused him taste\nThe baited meal before him placed.\nV\u00e1t\u00e1pi, when the rite was o\u2019er,\nWould take the giant form he wore, 170\nBut Saint Agastya knew his wile\nAnd checked the giant with smile.\n\u201cV\u00e1t\u00e1pi, thou with cruel spite\nHast conquered many an anchorite\nThe noblest of the Br\u00e1hman caste,\u2014 175\nAnd now thy ruin comes at last.\u201d\nNow if my power he thus defies,\nThis giant, like V\u00e1t\u00e1pi dies,\nDaring to scorn a man like me,\nA self subduing devotee. 180\nYea, as Agastya slew the foe,\nMy hand shall lay M\u00e1r\u00edcha low\nClad in thine arms thy bow in hand,\nTo guard the Maithil lady stand,\nWith watchful eye and thoughtful breast 185\nKeeping each word of my behest\nI go, and hunting through the brake\nThis wondrous deer will bring or take.\nYea surely I will bring the spoil\nReturning from my hunter\u2019s toil 190\nSee, Lakshma\u1e47 how my consort\u2019s eyes\nAre longing for the lovely prize.\nThis day it falls, that I may win\nThe treasure of so fair a skin.\nDo thou and S\u00edt\u00e1 watch with care 195\nLest danger seize you unaware.\nSwift from my bow one shaft will fly;\nThe stricken deer will fall and die\nThen quickly will I strip the game\nAnd bring the trophy to my dame. 200\nJa\u1e6d\u00e1yus, guardian good and wise,\nOur old and faithful friend,\nThe best and strongest bird that flies,\nHis willing aid will lend\nThe Maithil lady well protect, 205\nFor every chance provide,\nAnd in thy tender care suspect\nA foe on every side.\u201d\nCanto XLIV. M\u00e1r\u00edcha\u2019s Death\nThus having warned his brother bold\nHe grasped his sword with haft of gold,\nAnd bow with triple flexure bent,\nHis own delight and ornament;\nThen bound two quivers to his side, 5\nAnd hurried forth with eager stride.\nSoon as the antlered monarch saw\nThe lord of monarchs near him draw,\nA while with trembling heart he fled,\nThen turned and showed his stately head. 10\nWith sword and bow the chief pursued\nWhere\u2019er the fleeing deer he viewed\nSending from dell and lone recess\n566 The R\u00e2m\u00e2yana\nThe splendour of his loveliness.\nNow full in view the creature stood 15\nNow vanished in the depth of wood;\nNow running with a languid flight,\nNow like a meteor lost to sight.\nWith trembling limbs away he sped;\nThen like the moon with clouds o\u2019erspread 20\nGleamed for a moment bright between\nThe trees, and was again unseen.\nThus in the magic deer\u2019s disguise\nM\u00e1r\u00edcha lured him to the prize,\nAnd seen a while, then lost to view, 25\nFar from his cot the hero drew.\nStill by the flying game deceived\nThe hunter\u2019s heart was wroth and grieved,\nAnd wearied with the fruitless chase\nHe stayed him in a shady place. 30\nAgain the rover of the night\nEnraged the chieftain, full in sight,\nSlow moving in the coppice near,\nSurrounded by the woodland deer.\nAgain the hunter sought the game 35\nThat seemed a while to court his aim:\nBut seized again with sudden dread,\nBeyond his sight the creature fled.\nAgain the hero left the shade,\nAgain the deer before him strayed. 40\nWith surer hope and stronger will\nThe hunter longed his prey to kill.\nThen as his soul impatient grew,\nAn arrow from his side he drew,\nResplendent at the sunbeam\u2019s glow, 45\nThe crusher of the smitten foe.\nWith skillful heed the mighty lord\nFixed well shaft and strained the cord.\nUpon the deer his eyes he bent,\nAnd like a fiery serpent went 50\nThe arrow Brahma\u2019s self had framed,\nAlive with sparks that hissed and flamed,\nLike Indra\u2019s flashing levin, true\nTo the false deer the missile flew\nCleaving his flesh that wonderous dart 55\nStood quivering in M\u00e1r\u00edcha\u2019s heart.\nScarce from the ground one foot he sprang,\nThen stricken fell with deadly pang.\nHalf lifeless, as he pressed the ground,\nHe gave a roar of awful sound 60\nAnd ere the wounded giant died\nHe threw his borrowed form aside\nRemembering still his lord\u2019s behest\nHe pondered in his heart how best\nS\u00edt\u00e1 might send her guard away, 65\nAnd R\u00e1va\u1e47 seize the helpless prey.\nThe monster knew the time was nigh,\nAnd called aloud with eager cry,\n\u201cHo, S\u00edt\u00e1, Lakshma\u1e47\u201d and the tone\nHe borrowed was like R\u00e1ma\u2019s own. 70\n567 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSo by that matchless arrow cleft,\nThe deer\u2019s bright form M\u00e1r\u00edcha left,\nResumed his giant shape and size\nAnd closed in death his languid eyes.\nWhen R\u00e1ma saw his awful foe 75\nGasp, smeared with blood, in deadly throe,\nHis anxious thoughts to S\u00edt\u00e1 sped,\nAnd the wise words that Lakshma\u1e47 said,\nThat this was false M\u00e1r\u00edcha\u2019s art,\nReturned again upon his heart. 80\nHe knew the foe he triumphed o\u2019er\nThe name of great M\u00e1r\u00edcha bore.\n\u201cThe fiend,\u201d he pondered, \u2018ere he died,\n\u201cHo, Lakshma\u1e47! ho, my S\u00edt\u00e1!\u201d cried\nAh, if that cry has reached her ear, 85\nHow dire must be my darling\u2019s fear!\nAnd Lakshma\u1e47 of the mighty arm,\nWhat thinks he in his wild alarm?\nAs thus he thought in sad surmise,\nEach startled hair began to rise, 90\nAnd when he saw the giant slain\nAnd thought upon that cry again,\nHis spirit sank and terror pressed\nFull sorely on the hero\u2019s breast.\nAnother deer he chased and struck, 95\nHe bore away the the fallen buck,\nTo Janasth\u00e1n then turned his face\nAnd hastened to his dwelling place.\nCanto XLV. Lakshman\u2019s Departure\nBut S\u00edt\u00e1 hearing as she thought,\nHer husband\u2019s cry with anguish fraught,\nCalled to her guardian, \u201cLakshma\u1e47, run\nAnd in the wood seek Raghu\u2019s son.\nScarce can my heart retain its throne, 5\nScarce can my life be called mine own,\nAs all my powers and senses fail\nAt that long, loud and bitter wail.\nHaste to the wood with all thy speed\nAnd save thy brother in his need. 10\nGo, save him in the distant glade\nWhere loud he calls, for timely aid.\nHe falls beneath some giant foe\u2014\nA bull whom lions overthrow.\u201d\nDeaf to her prayer, no step he stirred 15\nObedient to his mother\u2019s word,\nThen Janak\u2019s child, with ire inflamed,\nIn words of bitter scorn exclaimed exclaimed\n\u201cSumitr\u00e1\u2019s son, a friend in show,\nThou art in truth thy brother\u2019s foe, 20\nWho canst at such any hour deny\nThy succour and neglect his cry.\nYes, Lakshma\u1e47, smit with love of me\nThy brother\u2019s death thou fain wouldst see.\nThis guilty love thy heart has swayed 25\n568 The R\u00e2m\u00e2yana\nAnd makes thy feet so loth to aid.\nThou hast no love for R\u00e1ma, no:\nThy joy is vice, thy thoughts are low\nHence thus unmoved thou yet canst stay\nWhile my dear lord is far away. 30\nIf aught of ill my lord betide\nWho led thee here, thy chief and guide,\nAh, what will be my hapless fate\nLeft in the wild wood desolate!\u201d\nThus spoke the lady sad with fear, 35\nWith many a sigh and many a tear,\nStill trembling like a captured doe:\nAnd Lakshma\u1e47 spoke to calm her woe:\n\u201cVidehan Queen, be sure of this,\u2014\nAnd at the thought thy fear dismiss,\u2014 40\nThy husband\u2019s mightier power defies\nAll Gods and angels of the skies,\nGandharvas, and the sons of light,\nSerpents, and rovers of the night.\nI tell thee, of the sons of earth, 45\nOf Gods who boast celestial birth,\nOf beasts and birds and giant hosts,\nOf demigods, Gandharvas, ghosts,\nOf awful fiends, O thou most fair,\nThere lives not one whose heart would dare 50\nTo meet thy R\u00e1ma in the fight,\nLike Indra\u2019s self unmatched in might.\nSuch idle words thou must not say\nThy R\u00e1ma lives whom none may slay.\nI will not, cannot leave thee here 55\nIn the wild wood till he be near.\nThe mightiest strength can ne\u2019er withstand\nHis eager force, his vigorous hand.\nNo, not the triple world allied\nWith all the immortal Gods beside. 60\nDismiss thy fear, again take heart,\nLet all thy doubt and woe depart.\nThy lord, be sure, will soon be here\nAnd bring thee back that best of deer.\nNot his, not his that mournful cry, 65\nNor haply came it from the sky.\nSome giant\u2019s art was busy there\nAnd framed a castle based on air.\nA precious pledge art thou, consigned\nTo me by him of noblest mind, 70\nNor can I fairest dame, forsake\nThe pledge which R\u00e1ma bade me take.\nUpon our heads, O Queen, we drew\nThe giants\u2019 hate when R\u00e1ma slew\nTheir chieftain Khara, and the shade 75\nOf Janasth\u00e1n in ruin laid.\nThrough all this mighty wood they rove\nWith varied cries from grove to grove\nOn rapine bent they wander here:\nBut O, dismiss thy causeless fear.\u201d 80\n569 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nBright flashed her eye as Lakshma\u1e47 spoke\nAnd forth her words of fury broke\nUpon her truthful guardian, flung\nWith bitter taunts that pierced and stung:\n\u201cShame on such false compassion, base 85\nDefiler of thy glorious race!\n\u2018Twere joyous sight I ween to thee\nMy lord in direst strait to see.\nThou knowest R\u00e1ma sore bested,\nOr word like this thou ne\u2019er hadst said. 90\nNo marvel if we find such sin\nIn rivals false to kith and kin.\nWretches like thee of evil kind,\nConcealing crime with crafty mind.\nThou, wretch, thine aid wilt still deny, 95\nAnd leave my lord alone to die.\nHas love of me unnerved thy hand,\nOr Bharat\u2019s art this ruin planned?\nBut be the treachery his or thine,\nIn vain, in vain the base design. 100\nFor how shall I, the chosen bride\nOf dark-hued R\u00e1ma, lotus-eyed,\nThe queen who once called R\u00e1ma mine,\nTo love of other men decline?\nBelieve me, Lakshma\u1e47, R\u00e1ma\u2019s wife 105\nBefore thine eyes will quit this life,\nAnd not a moment will she stay\nIf her dear lord have passed away.\u201d\nThe lady\u2019s bitter speech, that stirred\nEach hair upon his frame, he heard. 110\nWith lifted hands together laid,\nHis calm reply he gently made:\n\u201cNo words have I to answer now:\nMy deity, O Queen, art thou.\nBut \u2018tis no marvel, dame, to find 115\nSuch lack of sense in womankind.\nThroughout this world, O Maithil dame,\nWeak women\u2019s hearts are still the same.\nInconstant, urged by envious spite,\nThey sever friends and hate the right. 120\nI cannot brook, Videhan Queen,\nThy words intolerably keen.\nMine ears thy fierce reproaches pain\nAs boiling water seethes the brain.\nAnd now to bear me witness all 125\nThe dwellers in the

Ah, grief, that still\nEager to do my brother\u2019s will, 130\nMourning thy woman\u2019s nature, I\nMust see thee doubt my truth and die.\nI fly to R\u00e1ma\u2019s side, and Oh,\nMay bliss attend thee while I go!\nMay all attendant wood-gods screen 135\n570 The R\u00e2m\u00e2yana\nThy head from harm, O large-eyed Queen!\nAnd though dire omens meet my sight\nAnd fill my soul with wild affright,\nMay I return in peace and see\nThe son of Raghu safe with thee!\u201d 140\nThe child of Janak heard him speak,\nAnd the hot tear-drops down her cheek,\nIncreasing to a torrent, ran,\nAs thus once more the dame began:\n\u201cO Lakshma\u1e47, if I widowed be 145\nGod\u00e1var\u00ed\u2019s flood shall cover me,\nOr I will die by cord, or leap,\nLife weary, from yon rocky steep;\nOr deadly poison will I drink,\nOr \u2018neath the kindled flames will sink, 150\nBut never, reft of R\u00e1ma, can\nConsent to touch a meaner man.\u201d\nThe Maithil dame with many sighs,\nAnd torrents pouring from her eyes,\nThe faithful Lakshma\u1e47 thus addressed, 155\nAnd smote her hands upon her breast.\nSumitr\u00e1\u2019s son, o\u2019erwhelmed by fears,\nLooked on the large-eyed queen:\nHe saw that flood of burning tears,\nHe saw that piteous mien. 160\nHe yearned sweet comfort to afford,\nHe strove to soothe her pain;\nBut to the brother of her lord\nShe spoke no word again.\nHis reverent hands once more he raised, 165\nHis head he slightly bent,\nUpon her face he sadly gazed,\nAnd then toward R\u00e1ma went.\nCanto XLVI. The Guest\nThe angry Lakshma\u1e47 scarce could brook\nHer bitter words, her furious look.\nWith dark forebodings in his breast\nTo R\u00e1ma\u2019s side he quickly pressed.\nThen ten necked R\u00e1va\u1e47 saw the time 5\nPropitious for his purposed crime.\nA mendicant in guise he came\nAnd stood before the Maithil dame.\nHis garb was red, with tufted hair\nAnd sandalled feet a shade he bare, 10\nAnd from the fiend\u2019s left shoulder slung\nA staff and water-vessel hung.\nNear to the lovely dame he drew,\nWhile both the chiefs were far from view,\nAs darkness takes the evening air 15\nWhen neither sun nor moon is there.\nHe bent his eye upon the dame,\nA princess fair, of spotless fame:\n571 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSo might some baleful planet be\nNear Moon-forsaken Rohi\u1e47\u00ed. 20\nAs the fierce tyrant nearer drew,\nThe trees in Janasth\u00e1n that grew\nWaved not a leaf for fear and woe,\nAnd the hushed wind forbore to blow.\nGod\u00e1var\u00ed\u2019s waters as they fled, 25\nSaw his fierce eye-balls flashing red,\nAnd from each swiftly-gliding wave\nA melancholy murmur gave.\nThen R\u00e1va\u1e47, when his eager eye\nBeheld the longed-for moment nigh, 30\nIn mendicant\u2019s apparel dressed\nNear to the Maithil lady pressed.\nIn holy guise, a fiend abhorred,\nHe found her mourning for her lord.\nThus threatening draws \u015aani\u015bchar nigh 35\nTo Chitr\u00e1 in the evening sky;\nThus the deep well by grass concealed\nYawns treacherous in the verdant field.\nHe stood and looked upon the dame\nOf R\u00e1ma, queen of spotless fame 40\nWith her bright teeth and each fair limb\nLike the full moon she seemed to him,\nSitting within her leafy cot,\nWeeping for woe that left her not.\nThus, while with joy his pulses beat, 45\nHe saw her in her lone retreat,\nEyed like the lotus, fair to view\nIn silken robes of amber hue.\nPierced to the core by K\u00e1ma\u2019s dart\nHe murmured texts with lying art, 50\nAnd questioned with a soft address\nThe lady in her loneliness.\nThe fiend essayed with gentle speech\nThe heart of that fair dame to reach,\nPride of the worlds, like Beauty\u2019s Queen 55\nWithout her darling lotus seen:\n\u201cO thou whose silken robes enfold\nA form more fair than finest gold,\nWith lotus garland on thy head,\nLike a sweet spring with bloom o\u2019erspread, 60\nWho art thou, fair one, what thy name,\nBeauty, or Honour, Fortune, Fame,\nSpirit, or nymph, or Queen of love\nDescended from thy home above?\nBright as the dazzling jasmine shine 65\nThy small square teeth in level line.\nLike two black stars aglow with light\nThine eyes are large and pure and bright.\nThy charms of smile and teeth and hair\nAnd winning eyes, O thou most fair, 70\nSteal all my spirit, as the flow\nOf rivers mines the bank below.\nHow bright, how fine each flowing tress!\nHow firm those orbs beneath thy dress!\n572 The R\u00e2m\u00e2yana\nThat dainty waist with ease were spanned, 75\nSweet lady, by a lover\u2019s hand.\nMine eyes, O beauty, ne\u2019er have seen\nGoddess or nymph so fair of mien,\nOr bright Gandharva\u2019s heavenly dame,\nOr woman of so perfect frame. 80\nIn youth\u2019s soft prime thy years are few,\nAnd earth has naught so fair to view.\nI marvel one like thee in face\nShould make the woods her dwelling-place.\nLeave, lady, leave this lone retreat 85\nIn forest wilds for thee unmeet,\nWhere giants fierce and strong assume\nAll shapes and wander in the gloom.\nThese dainty feet were formed to tread\nSome palace floor with carpets spread, 90\nOr wander in trim gardens where\nEach opening bud perfumes the air.\nThe richest robe thy form should deck,\nThe rarest gems adorn thy neck,\nThe sweetest wreath should bind thy hair, 95\nThe noblest lord thy bed should share.\nArt thou akin, O fair of form,\nTo Rudras, or the Gods of storm,\nOr to the glorious Vasus? How\nCan less than these be bright as thou? 100\nBut never nymph or heavenly maid\nOr Goddess haunts this gloomy shade.\nHere giants roam, a savage race;\nWhat led thee to so dire a place?\nHere monkeys leap from tree to tree, 105\nAnd bears and tigers wander free;\nHere ravening lions prowl, and fell\nHyenas in the thickets yell,\nAnd elephants infuriate roam,\nMighty and fierce, their woodland home. 110\nDost thou not dread, so soft and fair,\nTiger and lion, wolf and bear?\nHast thou, O beauteous dame, no fear\nIn the wild wood so lone and drear?\nWhose and who art thou? whence and why 115\nSweet lady, with no guardian nigh,\nDost thou this awful forest tread\nBy giant bands inhabited?\u201d\nThe praise the high-souled R\u00e1va\u1e47 spoke\nNo doubt within her bosom woke. 120\nHis saintly look and Br\u00e1hman guise\nDeceived the lady\u2019s trusting eyes.\nWith due attention on the guest\nHer hospitable rites she pressed.\nShe bade the stranger to a seat, 125\nAnd gave him water for his feet.\nThe bowl and water-pot he bare,\nAnd garb which wandering Br\u00e1hmans wear\nForbade a doubt to rise.\nWon by his holy look she deemed 130\n573 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThe stranger even as he seemed\nTo her deluded eyes.\nIntent on hospitable care,\nShe brought her best of woodland fare,\nAnd showed her guest a seat. 135\nShe bade the saintly stranger lave\nHis feet in water which she gave,\nAnd sit and rest and eat.\nHe kept his eager glances bent\nOn her so kindly eloquent, 140\nWife of the noblest king;\nAnd longed in heart to steal her thence,\nPreparing by the dire offence,\nDeath on his head to bring.\nThe lady watched with anxious face 145\nFor R\u00e1ma coming from the chase\nWith Lakshma\u1e47 by his side:\nBut nothing met her wandering glance\nSave the wild forest\u2019s green expanse\nExtending far and wide. 150\nCanto XLVII. R\u00e1van\u2019s Wooing\nAs, clad in mendicant\u2019s disguise,\nHe questioned thus his destined prize,\nShe to the seeming saintly man\nThe story of her life began.\n\u201cMy guest is he,\u201d she thought, \u201cand I, 5\nTo \u2018scape his curse, must needs reply:\u201d\n\u201cChild of a noble sire I spring\nFrom Janak, fair Videha\u2019s king.\nMay every good be thine! my name\nIs S\u00edt\u00e1, R\u00e1ma\u2019s cherished dame. 10\nTwelve winters with my lord I spent\nMost happily with sweet content\nIn the rich home of Raghu\u2019s line,\nAnd every earthly joy was mine.\nTwelve pleasant years flew by, and then 15\nHis peers advised the king of men,\nR\u00e1ma, my lord, to consecrate\nJoint ruler of his ancient state.\nBut when the rites were scarce begun,\nTo consecrate Ikshv\u00e1ku\u2019s son, 20\nThe queen Kaikey\u00ed, honoured dame,\nSought of her lord an ancient claim.\nHer plea of former service pressed,\nAnd made him grant her new request,\nTo banish R\u00e1ma to the wild 25\nAnd consecrate instead her child.\nThis double prayer on him, the best\nAnd truest king, she strongly pressed:\n\u201cMine eyes in sleep I will not close,\nNor eat, nor drink, nor take repose. 30\nThis very day my death shall bring\nIf R\u00e1ma be anointed king.\u201d\nAs thus she spake in envious ire,\nThe aged king, my husband\u2019s sire,\n574 The R\u00e2m\u00e2yana\nBesought with fitting words; but she 35\nWas cold and deaf to every plea.\nAs yet my days are few; eighteen\nThe years of life that I have seen;\nAnd R\u00e1ma, best of all alive,\nHas passed of years a score and five\u2014 40\nR\u00e1ma the great and gentle, through\nAll region famed as pure and true,\nLarge-eyed and mighty-armed and tall,\nWith tender heart that cares for all.\nBut Da\u015baratha, led astray 45\nBy woman\u2019s wile and passion\u2019s sway,\nBy his strong love of her impelled,\nThe consecrating rites withheld.\nWhen, hopeful of the promised grace,\nMy R\u00e1ma sought his father\u2019s face, 50\nThe queen Kaikey\u00ed, ill at ease,\nSpoke to my lord brief words like these:\n\u201cHear, son of Raghu, hear from me\nThe words thy father says to thee:\n\u201cI yield this day to Bharat\u2019s hand, 55\nFree from all foes, this ancient land.\nFly from this home no longer thine,\nAnd dwell in woods five years and nine.\nLive in the forest and maintain\nMine honour pure from falsehood\u2019s stain.\u2019 \u201d 60\nThen R\u00e1ma spoke, untouched by dread:\n\u201cYea, it shall be as thou hast said.\u201d\nAnd answered, faithful to his vows,\nObeying Da\u015baratha\u2019s spouse:\n\u201cThe offered realm I would not take, 65\nBut still keep true the words he spake.\u201d\nThus, gentle Br\u00e1hman, R\u00e1ma still\nClung to his vow with firmest will.\nAnd valiant Lakshma\u1e47, dear to fame,\nHis brother by a younger dame, 70\nBold victor in the deadly fray,\nWould follow R\u00e1ma on his way.\nOn sternest vows his heart was set,\nAnd he, a youthful anchoret,\nBound up in twisted coil his hair 75\nAnd took the garb which hermits wear;\nThen with his bow to guard us, he\nWent forth with R\u00e1ma and with me.\nBy Queen Kaikey\u00ed\u2019s art bereft\nThe kingdom and our home we left, 80\nAnd bound by stern religious vows\nWe sought this shade of forest boughs.\nNow, best of Br\u00e1hmans, here we tread\nThese pathless regions dark and dread.\nBut come, refresh thy soul, and rest 85\nHere for a while an honoured guest,\nFor he, my lord, will soon be here\nWith fresh supply of woodland cheer,\nLarge store of venison of the buck,\nOr some great boar his hand has struck. 90\nMeanwhile, O stranger, grant my prayer:\n575 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThy name, thy race, thy birth declare,\nAnd why with no companion thou\nRoamest in Da\u1e47\u1e0dak forest now.\u201d\nThus questioned S\u00edt\u00e1, R\u00e1ma\u2019s dame. 95\nThen fierce the stranger\u2019s answer came:\n\u201cLord of the giant legions, he\nFrom whom celestial armies flee,\u2014\nThe dread of hell and earth and sky,\nR\u00e1va\u1e47 the R\u00e1kshas king am I. 100\nNow when thy gold-like form I view\nArrayed in silks of amber hue,\nMy love, O thou of perfect mould,\nFor all my dames is dead and cold.\nA thousand fairest women, torn 105\nFrom many a land my home adorn.\nBut come, loveliest lady, be\nThe queen of every dame and me.\nMy city Lank\u00e1, glorious town,\nLooks from a mountain\u2019s forehead down 110\nWhere ocean with his flash and foam\nBeats madly on mine island home.\nWith me, O S\u00edt\u00e1, shalt thou rove\nDelighted through each shady grove,\nNor shall thy happy breast retain 115\nFond memory of this life of pain.\nIn gay attire, a glittering band,\nFive thousand maids shall round thee stand,\nAnd serve thee at thy beck and sign,\nIf thou, fair S\u00edt\u00e1, wilt be mine.\u201d 120\nThen forth her noble passion broke\nAs thus in turn the lady spoke:\n\u201cMe, me the wife of R\u00e1ma, him\nThe lion lord with lion\u2019s limb,\nStrong as the sea, firm as the rock, 125\nLike Indra in the battle shock.\nThe lord of each auspicious sign,\nThe glory of his princely line,\nLike some fair Bodh tree strong and tall,\nThe noblest and the best of all, 130\nR\u00e1ma, the heir of happy fate\nWho keeps his word inviolate,\nLord of the lion gait, possessed\nOf mighty arm and ample chest,\nR\u00e1ma the lion-warrior, him 135\nWhose moon bright face no fear can dim,\nR\u00e1ma, his bridled passions\u2019 lord,\nThe darling whom his sire adored,\u2014\nMe, me the true and loving dame\nOf R\u00e1ma, prince of deathless fame\u2014 140\nMe wouldst thou vainly woo and press?\nA jackal woo a lioness!\nSteal from the sun his glory! such\nThy hope Lord R\u00e1ma\u2019s wife to touch.\nHa!

80\nFair as the lotus when the bud\nIs rising from the parent flood.\nWith faultless lip and nose and eye,\nDear as the moon that floods the sky\nWith gentle light, of perfect mould, 85\nShe seemed a thing of burnished gold,\nThough on her cheek the traces lay\nOf tears her hand had brushed away.\nBut as the moon-beams swiftly fade\nEre the great Day-God shines displayed, 90\n589 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSo in that form of perfect grace\nStill trembling in the fiend\u2019s embrace,\nFrom her beloved R\u00e1ma reft,\nNo light of pride or joy was left.\nThe lady with her golden hue 95\nO\u2019er the swart fiend a lustre threw,\nAs when embroidered girths enfold\nAn elephant with gleams of gold.\nFair as the lily\u2019s bending stem,\u2014\nHer arms adorned with many a gem, 100\nA lustre to the fiend she lent\nGleaming from every ornament,\nAs when the cloud-shot flashes light\nThe shadows of a mountain height.\nWhene\u2019er the breezes earthward bore 105\nThe tinkling of the zone she wore,\nHe seemed a cloud of darkness hue\nSending forth murmurs as it flew.\nAs on her way the dame was sped\nFrom her sweet neck fair flowers were shed, 110\nThe swift wind caught the flowery rain\nAnd poured it o\u2019er the fiend again.\nThe wind-stirred blossoms, sweet to smell,\nOn the dark brows of R\u00e1va\u1e47 fell,\nLike lunar constellations set 115\nOn Meru for a coronet.\nFrom her small foot an anklet fair\nWith jewels slipped, and through the air,\nLike a bright circlet of the flame\nOf thunder, to the valley came. 120\nThe Maithil lady, fair to see\nAs the young leaflet of a tree\nClad in the tender hues of spring,\nFlashed glory on the giant king,\nAs when a gold-embroidered zone 125\nAround an elephant is thrown.\nWhile, bearing far the lady, through\nThe realms of sky the giant flew,\nShe like a gleaming meteor cast\nA glory round her as she passed. 130\nThen from each limb in swift descent\nDropped many a sparkling ornament:\nOn earth they rested dim and pale\nLike fallen stars when virtues fail.\nAround her neck a garland lay 135\nBright as the Star-God\u2019s silvery ray:\nIt fell and flashed like Gang\u00e1 sent\nFrom heaven above the firmament.\nThe birds of every wing had flocked\nTo stately trees by breezes rocked: 140\nThese bowed their wind-swept heads and said:\n\u201cMy lady sweet, be comforted.\u201d\nWith faded blooms each brook within\nWhose waters moved no gleamy fin,\nStole sadly through the forest dell 145\nMourning the dame it loved so well.\nFrom every woodland region near\n590 The R\u00e2m\u00e2yana\nCame lions, tigers, birds, and deer,\nAnd followed, each with furious look,\nThe way her flying shadow took. 150\nFor S\u00edt\u00e1\u2019s loss each lofty hill\nWhose tears were waterfall, and rill,\nLifting on high each arm-like steep,\nSeemed in the general woe to weep.\nWhen the great sun, the lord of day, 155\nSaw R\u00e1va\u1e47 tear the dame away,\nHis glorious light began to fail\nAnd all his disk grew cold and pale.\n\u201cIf R\u00e1va\u1e47 from the forest flies\nWith R\u00e1ma\u2019s S\u00edt\u00e1 as his prize, 160\nJustice and truth have vanished hence,\nHonour and right and innocence.\u201d\nThus rose the cry of wild despair\nFrom spirits as they gathered there.\nIn trembling troops in open lawns 165\nWept, wild with woe, the startled fawns,\nAnd a strange terror changed the eyes\nThey lifted to the distant skies.\nOn silvan Gods who love the dell\nA sudden fear and trembling fell, 170\nAs in the deepest woe they viewed\nThe lady by the fiend subdued.\nStill in loud shrieks was heard afar\nThat voice whose sweetness naught could mar,\nWhile eager looks of fear and woe 175\nShe bent upon the earth below.\nThe lady of each winning wile\nWith pearly teeth and lovely smile,\nSeized by the lord of Lank\u00e1\u2019s isle,\nLooked down for friends in vain. 180\nShe saw no friend to aid her, none,\nNot R\u00e1ma nor the younger son\nOf Da\u015baratha, and undone\nShe swooned with fear and pain.\nCanto LIII.

While Dante, as an Italian, obviously stacks the deck in favor\nof Roman poets, his list highlights the importance of the two selections in this chapter: Virgil\u2019s Aeneid and Ovid\u2019s\nMetamorphoses. While Horace and Lucan are no longer quite as famous as the others, literary critics today recog-\nnize the influence and quality of Virgil and Ovid\u2019s works.\nAlthough they were (roughly) contemporaries, the older Virgil had grown up in a world split by civil wars: first\nJulius Caesar against Pompey the Great, and later Mark Antony (and Cleopatra) against Julius Caesar\u2019s nephew Oc-\ntavian, who would take the name Augustus Caesar when he became the first Roman Emperor. Ovid was born after\nthe civil wars were over. As a result, Virgil was an advocate for stability in his poetry, while Ovid took a much freer\napproach in his works.\nVirgil reshapes the story of Aeneas to demonstrate what he (and Augustus) saw as the perfect Roman values.\nAeneas, however, is not simply a reflection of Virgil\u2019s time period; the Aeneid attempts to use literature to shape real\nlife by showing a model hero worthy of inspiring imitation. To a certain extent, Virgil succeeds, at least in future\ngenerations. Ovid is more of a reflection of Virgil\u2019s actual time period. Ovid\u2019s witty sophistication and humorous\nexcesses in his early love poetry provide us with a more decadent picture of Rome. Both poets turn to epic poet-\nry later in life, but for opposite reasons: one to create order out of chaos, and one to question (in all seriousness)\nwhether that order is artificial.\nAugustus Caesar\u2019s reaction to each poet epitomizes the difference between them. Virgil was directed by Augus-\ntus to write the Aeneid, which rewrites history to explain how Rome was pre-ordained by the gods to be an empire.\nVirgil\u2019s depiction of the fall of Troy includes Roman fighting techniques and religious beliefs (such as the lares, or\nhousehold gods) that would have been foreign to Homer\u2019s Greeks and Trojans. Since the Aeneid includes the dei-\nfication of Augustus (foretold in Aeneid 6), it is a splendid piece of propaganda for a man who only called himself\nthe son of the deified (Julius Caesar), rather than a god. When Virgil was dying, he asked that the nearly complete\nmanuscript be burnt; Augustus ordered the manuscript to be finished and published. Conversely, Ovid\u2019s work\nchallenged the very notion that the people around him were anything but human. Ovid\u2019s works included a book of\nletters by the women who are abandoned by the so-called heroes of mythology (the Heroides), a scandalous book of\nlove poetry (the Amores), and a manual on how to pick up women (the Ars Amatoria). In particular, the Ars Amato-\nria was so popular that he wrote a section on how women could pick up men (hardly an example of early feminism,\nbut unusual for the time). Ovid\u2019s view of power was skeptical, at best, since the Metamorphoses catalogues the bad\nbehavior of the gods that led us to the present state of affairs. In Metamorphoses 15, Ovid explains why the gods al-\nlowed Julius Caesar to be killed, followed by a prayer that Augustus should have more time on earth before the gods\ntake him too: not exactly the emphasis that Augustus might have preferred. Exiled by Augustus for his scandalous\npoetry, Ovid was never allowed to return to Rome.\nAlthough Roman culture had appropriated Greek literature and religion, changing the names of characters\nand gods but continuing their stories, there were significant differences in Roman religious practices. Worship of\nthe most important gods was directed by the flamines maiores (the \u201cmajor priests\u201d) of the three principle cults (to\nJupiter, Mars, and Quirinus), while the flamines minores (or \u201cminor priests\u201d) directed the worship of the rest of the\ngods. The Romans had quite a few gods that had no equivalent among the Greek gods, and their identities some-\ntimes altered over time. In certain cases, earlier Roman gods were absorbed into another god\u2019s identity or replaced\nentirely. For example, the Greek goddess Artemis was, over time, equated with the Roman goddess Diana, who\nalso came to be identified with the Greek goddess Hecate, whose rough equivalent was the Roman goddess Trivia.\nAll four figures eventually were identified as one goddess, who had multiple aspects to her power, and who was\nworshipped by multiple names. Apollo, however, had no equivalent match among the Roman gods, so he remained\nApollo. The following comparison of Greek and Roman gods is particularly useful for anyone who has read Ho-\nmer\u2019s works.\n621 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nRoman Name Greek Name\nJupiter\/Jove Zeus\nJuno hera\nMinerva Athena (or Pallas Athena)\nApollo Apollo\nVenus Aphrodite\ndiana Artemis\nMercury hermes\nNeptune Poseidon\nPluto hades\nMars Ares\nVulcan hephaestus\nBacchus dionysus\nProserpina Persephone\nCeres demeter\nPan Pan\nCupid eros\n(Ulysses) (Odysseus)\nAs you read, consider the following questions:\n\u2022 How does each epic portray the gods?

and there, for sums of gold,\nThe lifeless body of his son is sold.\nSo sad an object, and so well express\u2019d, 680\nDrew sighs and groans from the griev\u2019d hero\u2019s breast,\nTo see the figure of his lifeless friend,\nAnd his old sire his helpless hand extend.\nHimself he saw amidst the Grecian train,\nMix\u2019d in the bloody battle on the plain; 685\nAnd swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew,\nHis pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew.\nPenthisilea there, with haughty grace,\nLeads to the wars an Amazonian race:\nIn their right hands a pointed dart they wield; 690\nThe left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield.\nAthwart her breast a golden belt she throws,\nAmidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes,\nAnd dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose.\nThus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes, 695\nFix\u2019d on the walls with wonder and surprise,\nThe beauteous Dido, with a num\u2019rous train\nAnd pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane.\nSuch on Eurotas\u2019 banks, or Cynthus\u2019 height,\nDiana seems; and so she charms the sight, 700\nWhen in the dance the graceful goddess leads\nThe choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads:\n635 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nKnown by her quiver, and her lofty mien,\nShe walks majestic, and she looks their queen;\nLatona sees her shine above the rest, 705\nAnd feeds with secret joy her silent breast.\nSuch Dido was; with such becoming state,\nAmidst the crowd, she walks serenely great.\nTheir labor to her future sway she speeds,\nAnd passing with a gracious glance proceeds; 710\nThen mounts the throne, high plac\u2019d before the shrine:\nIn crowds around, the swarming people join.\nShe takes petitions, and dispenses laws,\nHears and determines ev\u2019ry private cause;\nTheir tasks in equal portions she divides, 715\nAnd, where unequal, there by lots decides.\nAnother way by chance Aeneas bends\nHis eyes, and unexpected sees his friends,\nAntheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong,\nAnd at their backs a mighty Trojan throng, 720\nWhom late the tempest on the billows toss\u2019d,\nAnd widely scatter\u2019d on another coast.\nThe prince, unseen, surpris\u2019d with wonder stands,\nAnd longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands;\nBut, doubtful of the wish\u2019d event, he stays, 725\nAnd from the hollow cloud his friends surveys,\nImpatient till they told their present state,\nAnd where they left their ships, and what their fate,\nAnd why they came, and what was their request;\nFor these were sent, commission\u2019d by the rest, 730\nTo sue for leave to land their sickly men,\nAnd gain admission to the gracious queen.\nEnt\u2019ring, with cries they fill\u2019d the holy fane;\nThen thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:\n\u201cO queen! indulg\u2019d by favor of the gods 735\nTo found an empire in these new abodes,\nTo build a town, with statutes to restrain\nThe wild inhabitants beneath thy reign,\nWe wretched Trojans, toss\u2019d on ev\u2019ry shore,\nFrom sea to sea, thy clemency implore. 740\nForbid the fires our shipping to deface!\nReceive th\u2019 unhappy fugitives to grace,\nAnd spare the remnant of a pious race!\nWe come not with design of wasteful prey,\nTo drive the country, force the swains away: 745\nNor such our strength, nor such is our desire;\nThe vanquish\u2019d dare not to such thoughts aspire.\nA land there is, Hesperia nam\u2019d of old;\nThe soil is fruitful, and the men are bold\u2014\nTh\u2019 Oenotrians held it once\u2014by common fame 750\nNow call\u2019d Italia, from the leader\u2019s name.\nTo that sweet region was our voyage bent,\nWhen winds and ev\u2019ry warring element\nDisturb\u2019d our course, and, far from sight of land,\nCast our torn vessels on the moving sand: 755\nThe sea came on; the South, with mighty roar,\nDispers\u2019d and dash\u2019d the rest upon the rocky shore.\nThose few you see escap\u2019d the Storm, and fear,\n636 The Aeneid\nUnless you interpose, a shipwreck here.\nWhat men, what monsters, what inhuman race, 760\nWhat laws, what barb\u2019rous customs of the place,\nShut up a desart shore to drowning men,\nAnd drive us to the cruel seas again?\nIf our hard fortune no compassion draws,\nNor hospitable rights, nor human laws, 765\nThe gods are just, and will revenge our cause.\nAeneas was our prince: a juster lord,\nOr nobler warrior, never drew a sword;\nObservant of the right, religious of his word.\nIf yet he lives, and draws this vital air, 770\nNor we, his friends, of safety shall despair;\nNor you, great queen, these offices repent,\nWhich he will equal, and perhaps augment.\nWe want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts,\nWhere King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts. 775\nPermit our ships a shelter on your shores,\nRefitted from your woods with planks and oars,\nThat, if our prince be safe, we may renew\nOur destin\u2019d course, and Italy pursue.\nBut if, O best of men, the Fates ordain 780\nThat thou art swallow\u2019d in the Libyan main,\nAnd if our young Iulus be no more,\nDismiss our navy from your friendly shore,\nThat we to good Acestes may return,\nAnd with our friends our common losses mourn.\u201d 785\nThus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew\nWith cries and clamors his request renew.\nThe modest queen a while, with downcast eyes,\nPonder\u2019d the speech; then briefly thus replies:\n\u201cTrojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel fate, 790\nAnd doubts attending an unsettled state,\nForce me to guard my coast from foreign foes.\nWho has not heard the story of your woes,\nThe name and fortune of your native place,\nThe fame and valor of the Phrygian race? 795\nWe Tyrians are not so devoid of sense,\nNor so remote from Phoebus\u2019 influence.\nWhether to Latian shores your course is bent,\nOr, driv\u2019n by tempests from your first intent,\nYou seek the good Acestes\u2019 government, 800\nYour men shall be receiv\u2019d, your fleet repair\u2019d,\nAnd sail, with ships of convoy for your guard:\nOr, would you stay, and join your friendly pow\u2019rs\nTo raise and to defend the Tyrian tow\u2019rs,\nMy wealth, my city, and myself are yours. 805\nAnd would to Heav\u2019n, the Storm, you felt, would bring\nOn Carthaginian coasts your wand\u2019ring king.\nMy people shall, by my command, explore\nThe ports and creeks of ev\u2019ry winding shore,\nAnd towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest 810\nOf so renown\u2019d and so desir\u2019d a guest.\u201d\nRais\u2019d in his mind the Trojan hero stood,\nAnd long\u2019d to break from out his ambient cloud:\n637 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAchates found it, and thus urg\u2019d his way:\n\u201cFrom whence, O goddess-born, this long delay? 815\nWhat more can you desire, your welcome sure,\nYour fleet in safety, and your friends secure?\nOne only wants; and him we saw in vain\nOppose the Storm, and swallow\u2019d in the main.\nOrontes in his fate our forfeit paid; 820\nThe rest agrees with what your mother said.\u201d\nScarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way,\nThe mists flew upward and dissolv\u2019d in day.\nThe Trojan chief appear\u2019d in open sight,\nAugust in visage, and serenely bright. 825\nHis mother goddess, with her hands divine,\nHad form\u2019d his curling locks, and made his temples shine,\nAnd giv\u2019n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace,\nAnd breath\u2019d a youthful vigor on his face;\nLike polish\u2019d ivory, beauteous to behold, 830\nOr Parian marble, when enchas\u2019d in gold:\nThus radiant from the circling cloud he broke,\nAnd thus with manly modesty he spoke:\n\u201cHe whom you seek am I; by tempests toss\u2019d,\nAnd sav\u2019d from shipwreck on your Libyan coast; 835\nPresenting, gracious queen, before your throne,\nA prince that owes his life to you alone.\nFair majesty, the refuge and redress\nOf those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress,\nYou, who your pious offices employ 840\nTo save the relics of abandon\u2019d Troy;\nReceive the shipwreck\u2019d on your friendly shore,\nWith hospitable rites relieve the poor;\nAssociate in your town a wand\u2019ring train,\nAnd strangers in your palace entertain: 845\nWhat thanks can wretched fugitives return,\nWho, scatter\u2019d thro\u2019 the world, in exile mourn?\nThe gods, if gods to goodness are inclin\u2019d;\nIf acts of mercy touch their heav\u2019nly mind,\nAnd, more than all the gods, your gen\u2019rous heart. 850\nConscious of worth, requite its own desert!\nIn you this age is happy, and this earth,\nAnd parents more than mortal gave you birth.\nWhile rolling rivers into seas shall run,\nAnd round the space of heav\u2019n the radiant sun; 855\nWhile trees the mountain tops with shades supply,\nYour honor, name, and praise shall never die.\nWhate\u2019er abode my fortune has assign\u2019d,\nYour image shall be present in my mind.\u201d\nThus having said, he turn\u2019d with pious haste, 860\nAnd joyful his expecting friends embrac\u2019d:\nWith his right hand Ilioneus was grac\u2019d,\nSerestus with his left; then to his breast\nCloanthus and the noble Gyas press\u2019d;\nAnd so by turns descended to the rest. 865\nThe Tyrian queen stood fix\u2019d upon his face,\nPleas\u2019d with his motions, ravish\u2019d with his grace;\n638 The Aeneid\nAdmir\u2019d his fortunes, more admir\u2019d the man;\nThen recollected stood, and thus began:\n\u201cWhat fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow\u2019rs 870\nHave cast you shipwrack\u2019d on our barren shores?\nAre you the great Aeneas, known to fame,\nWho from celestial seed your lineage claim?\nThe same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore\nTo fam\u2019d Anchises on th\u2019 Idaean shore? 875\nIt calls into my mind, tho\u2019 then a child,\nWhen Teucer came, from Salamis exil\u2019d,\nAnd sought my father\u2019s aid, to be restor\u2019d:\nMy father Belus then with fire and sword\nInvaded Cyprus, made the region bare, 880\nAnd, conqu\u2019ring, finish\u2019d the successful war.\nFrom him the Trojan siege I understood,\nThe Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood.\nYour foe himself the Dardan valor prais\u2019d,\nAnd his own ancestry from Trojans rais\u2019d. 885\nEnter, my noble guest, and you shall find,\nIf not a costly welcome, yet a kind:\nFor I myself, like you, have been distress\u2019d,\nTill Heav\u2019n afforded me this place of rest;\nLike you, an alien in a land unknown, 890\nI learn to pity woes so like my own.\u201d\nShe said, and to the palace led her guest;\nThen offer\u2019d incense, and proclaim\u2019d a feast.\nNor yet less careful for her absent friends,\nTwice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends; 895\nBesides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs,\nWith bleating cries, attend their milky dams;\nAnd jars of gen\u2019rous wine and spacious bowls\nShe gives, to cheer the sailors\u2019 drooping souls.\nNow purple hangings clothe the palace walls, 900\nAnd sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls:\nOn Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine;\nWith loads of massy plate the sideboards shine,\nAnd antique vases, all of gold emboss\u2019d\n(The gold itself inferior to the cost), 905\nOf curious work, where on the sides were seen\nThe fights and figures of illustrious men,\nFrom their first founder to the present queen.\nThe good Aeneas, paternal care\nIulus\u2019 absence could no longer bear, 910\nDispatch\u2019d Achates to the ships in haste,\nTo give a glad relation of the past,\nAnd, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,\nSnatch\u2019d from the ruins of unhappy Troy:\nA robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire; 915\nAn upper vest, once Helen\u2019s rich attire,\nFrom Argos by the fam\u2019d adultress brought,\nWith golden flow\u2019rs and winding foliage wrought,\nHer mother Leda\u2019s present, when she came\nTo ruin Troy and set the world on flame; 920\nThe scepter Priam\u2019s eldest daughter bore,\nHer orient necklace, and the crown she wore\n639 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nOf double texture, glorious to behold,\nOne order set with gems, and one with gold.\nInstructed thus, the wise Achates goes, 925\nAnd in his diligence his duty shows.\nBut Venus, anxious for her son\u2019s affairs,\nNew counsels tries, and new designs prepares:\nThat Cupid should assume the shape and face\nOf sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace; 930\nShould bring the presents, in her nephew\u2019s stead,\nAnd in Eliza\u2019s veins the gentle poison shed:\nFor much she fear\u2019d the Tyrians, double-tongued,\nAnd knew the town to Juno\u2019s care belong\u2019d.\nThese thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke, 935\nAnd thus alarm\u2019d, to winged Love she spoke:\n\u201cMy son, my strength, whose mighty pow\u2019r alone\nControls the Thund\u2019rer on his awful throne,\nTo thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,\nAnd on thy succor and thy faith relies. 940\nThou know\u2019st, my son, how Jove\u2019s revengeful wife,\nBy force and fraud, attempts thy brother\u2019s life;\nAnd often hast thou mourn\u2019d with me his pains.\nHim Dido now with blandishment detains;\nBut I suspect the town where Juno reigns. 945\nFor this \u2018t is needful to prevent her art,\nAnd fire with love the proud Phoenician\u2019s heart:\nA love so violent, so strong, so sure,\nAs neither age can change, nor art can cure.\nHow this may be perform\u2019d, now take my mind: 950\nAscanius by his father is design\u2019d\nTo come, with presents laden, from the port,\nTo gratify the queen, and gain the court.\nI mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,\nAnd, ravish\u2019d, in Idalian bow\u2019rs to keep, 955\nOr high Cythera, that the sweet deceit\nMay pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat.\nTake thou his form and shape. I beg the grace\nBut only for a night\u2019s revolving space:\nThyself a boy, assume a boy\u2019s dissembled face; 960\nThat when, amidst the fervor of the feast,\nThe Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast,\nAnd with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,\nThou may\u2019st infuse thy venom in her veins.\u201d\nThe God of Love obeys, and sets aside 965\nHis bow and quiver, and his plumy pride;\nHe walks Iulus in his mother\u2019s sight,\nAnd in the sweet resemblance takes delight.\nThe goddess then to young Ascanius flies,\nAnd in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes: 970\nLull\u2019d in her lap, amidst a train of Loves,\nShe gently bears him to her blissful groves,\nThen with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head,\nAnd softly lays him on a flow\u2019ry bed.\nCupid meantime assum\u2019d his form and face, 975\nFoll\u2019wing Achates with a shorter pace,\nAnd brought the gifts. The queen already sate\n640 The Aeneid\nAmidst the Trojan lords, in shining state,\nHigh on a golden bed: her princely guest\nWas next her side; in order sate the rest. 980\nThen canisters with bread are heap\u2019d on high;\nTh\u2019 attendants water for their hands supply,\nAnd, having wash\u2019d, with silken towels dry.\nNext fifty handmaids in long order bore\nThe censers, and with fumes the gods adore: 985\nThen youths, and virgins twice as many, join\nTo place the dishes, and to serve the wine.\nThe Tyrian train, admitted to the feast,\nApproach, and on the painted couches rest.\nAll on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze, 990\nBut view the beauteous boy with more amaze,\nHis rosy-color\u2019d cheeks, his radiant eyes,\nHis motions, voice, and shape, and all the god\u2019s disguise;\nNor pass unprais\u2019d the vest and veil divine,\nWhich wand\u2019ring foliage and rich flow\u2019rs entwine. 995\nBut, far above the rest, the royal dame,\n(Already doom\u2019d to love\u2019s disastrous flame,)\nWith eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy,\nBeholds the presents, and admires the boy.\nThe guileful god about the hero long, 1000\nWith children\u2019s play, and false embraces, hung;\nThen sought the queen: she took him to her arms\nWith greedy pleasure, and devour\u2019d his charms.\nUnhappy Dido little thought what guest,\nHow dire a god, she drew so near her breast; 1005\nBut he, not mindless of his mother\u2019s pray\u2019r,\nWorks in the pliant bosom of the fair,\nAnd molds her heart anew, and blots her former care.\nThe dead is to the living love resign\u2019d;\nAnd all Aeneas enters in her mind. 1010\nNow, when the rage of hunger was appeas\u2019d,\nThe meat remov\u2019d, and ev\u2019ry guest was pleas\u2019d,\nThe golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown\u2019d,\nAnd thro\u2019 the palace cheerful cries resound.\nFrom gilded roofs depending lamps display 1015\nNocturnal beams, that emulate the day.\nA golden bowl, that shone with gems divine,\nThe queen commanded to be crown\u2019d with wine:\nThe bowl that Belus us\u2019d, and all the Tyrian line.\nThen, silence thro\u2019 the hall proclaim\u2019d, she spoke: 1020\n\u201cO hospitable Jove!

their destin\u2019d way they take, 1345\nAnd to Laocoon and his children make;\nAnd first around the tender boys they wind,\nThen with their sharpen\u2019d fangs their limbs and bodies grind.\nThe wretched father, running to their aid\nWith pious haste, but vain, they next invade; 1350\nTwice round his waist their winding volumes roll\u2019d;\nAnd twice about his gasping throat they fold.\nThe priest thus doubly chok\u2019d, their crests divide,\nAnd tow\u2019ring o\u2019er his head in triumph ride.\nWith both his hands he labors at the knots; 1355\nHis holy fillets the blue venom blots;\nHis roaring fills the flitting air around.\nThus, when an ox receives a glancing wound,\nHe breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies,\nAnd with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies. 1360\nTheir tasks perform\u2019d, the serpents quit their prey,\nAnd to the tow\u2019r of Pallas make their way:\nCouch\u2019d at her feet, they lie protected there\nBy her large buckler and protended spear.\nAmazement seizes all;

some, more bold,\nSwerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold;\nTheir left hand gripes their bucklers in th\u2019 ascent, 1670\nWhile with their right they seize the battlement.\nFrom their demolish\u2019d tow\u2019rs the Trojans throw\nHuge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe;\nAnd heavy beams and rafters from the sides\n(Such arms their last necessity provides) 1675\nAnd gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high,\nThe marks of state and ancient royalty.\nThe guards below, fix\u2019d in the pass, attend\nThe charge undaunted, and the gate defend.\nRenew\u2019d in courage with recover\u2019d breath, 1680\nA second time we ran to tempt our death,\nTo clear the palace from the foe, succeed\nThe weary living, and revenge the dead.\n\u201cA postern door, yet unobserv\u2019d and free,\nJoin\u2019d by the length of a blind gallery, 1685\nTo the king\u2019s closet led: a way well known\nTo Hector\u2019s wife, while Priam held the throne,\nThro\u2019 which she brought Astyanax, unseen,\nTo cheer his grandsire and his grandsire\u2019s queen.\nThro\u2019 this we pass, and mount the tow\u2019r, from whence 1690\nWith unavailing arms the Trojans make defense.\nFrom this the trembling king had oft descried\nThe Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride.\nBeams from its lofty height with swords we hew,\nThen, wrenching with our hands, th\u2019 assault renew; 1695\nAnd, where the rafters on the columns meet,\nWe push them headlong with our arms and feet.\nThe lightning flies not swifter than the fall,\n653 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nNor thunder louder than the ruin\u2019d wall:\nDown goes the top at once;

and rais\u2019d on spires he rides;\nHigh o\u2019er the grass, hissing he rolls along,\nAnd brandishes by fits his forky tongue.\nProud Periphas, and fierce Automedon,\nHis father\u2019s charioteer, together run 1715\nTo force the gate; the Scyrian infantry\nRush on in crowds, and the barr\u2019d passage free.\nEnt\u2019ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend;\nAnd flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend.\nHimself, among the foremost, deals his blows, 1720\nAnd with his ax repeated strokes bestows\nOn the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply,\nTill from the posts the brazen hinges fly.\nHe hews apace; the double bars at length\nYield to his ax and unresisted strength. 1725\nA mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal\u2019d\nAppear, and all the palace is reveal\u2019d;\nThe halls of audience, and of public state,\nAnd where the lonely queen in secret sate.\nArm\u2019d soldiers now by trembling maids are seen, 1730\nWith not a door, and scarce a space, between.\nThe house is fill\u2019d with loud laments and cries,\nAnd shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies;\nThe fearful matrons run from place to place,\nAnd kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace. 1735\nThe fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies,\nAnd all his father sparkles in his eyes;\nNor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain:\nThe bars are broken, and the guards are slain.\nIn rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill; 1740\nThose few defendants whom they find, they kill.\nNot with so fierce a rage the foaming flood\nRoars, when he finds his rapid course withstood;\nBears down the dams with unresisted sway,\nAnd sweeps the cattle and the cots away. 1745\nThese eyes beheld him when he march\u2019d between\nThe brother kings: I saw th\u2019 unhappy queen,\nThe hundred wives, and where old Priam stood,\nTo stain his hallow\u2019d altar with his brood.\nThe fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he, 1750\nSo large a promise, of a progeny),\nThe posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils,\nFell the reward of the proud victor\u2019s toils.\nWhere\u2019er the raging fire had left a space,\nThe Grecians enter and possess the place. 1755\n654 The Aeneid\n\u201cPerhaps you may of Priam\u2019s fate enquire.\nHe, when he saw his regal town on fire,\nHis ruin\u2019d palace, and his ent\u2019ring foes,\nOn ev\u2019ry side inevitable woes,\nIn arms, disus\u2019d, invests his limbs, decay\u2019d, 1760\nLike them, with age;

near the hearth a laurel grew,\nDodder\u2019d with age, whose boughs encompass round\nThe household gods, and shade the holy ground.\nHere Hecuba, with all her helpless train\nOf dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain. 1770\nDriv\u2019n like a flock of doves along the sky,\nTheir images they hug, and to their altars fly.\nThe Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord,\nAnd hanging by his side a heavy sword,\n\u2018What rage,\u2019 she cried, \u2018has seiz\u2019d my husband\u2019s mind? 1775\nWhat arms are these, and to what use design\u2019d?\nThese times want other aids!

2220\nBut ev\u2019ry drop this living tree contains\nIs kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins.\nO fly from this unhospitable shore,\nWarn\u2019d by my fate; for I am Polydore!\nHere loads of lances, in my blood embrued, 2225\nAgain shoot upward, by my blood renew\u2019d.\u2019\n\u201cMy falt\u2019ring tongue and shiv\u2019ring limbs declare\nMy horror, and in bristles rose my hair.\nWhen Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent,\nOld Priam, fearful of the war\u2019s event, 2230\nThis hapless Polydore to Thracia sent:\nLoaded with gold, he sent his darling, far\nFrom noise and tumults, and destructive war,\nCommitted to the faithless tyrant\u2019s care;\nWho, when he saw the pow\u2019r of Troy decline, 2235\nForsook the weaker, with the strong to join;\nBroke ev\u2019ry bond of nature and of truth,\nAnd murder\u2019d, for his wealth, the royal youth.\nO sacred hunger of pernicious gold!\nWhat bands of faith can impious lucre hold? 2240\nNow, when my soul had shaken off her fears,\nI call my father and the Trojan peers;\nRelate the prodigies of Heav\u2019n, require\nWhat he commands, and their advice desire.\nAll vote to leave that execrable shore, 2245\nPolluted with the blood of Polydore;\nBut, ere we sail, his fun\u2019ral rites prepare,\nThen, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear.\nIn mournful pomp the matrons walk the round,\nWith baleful cypress and blue fillets crown\u2019d, 2250\nWith eyes dejected, and with hair unbound.\nThen bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour,\nAnd thrice invoke the soul of Polydore.\n663 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n\u201cNow, when the raging storms no longer reign,\nBut southern gales invite us to the main, 2255\nWe launch our vessels, with a prosp\u2019rous wind,\nAnd leave the cities and the shores behind.\n\u201cAn island in th\u2019 Aegaean main appears;\nNeptune and wat\u2019ry Doris claim it theirs.\nIt floated once, till Phoebus fix\u2019d the sides 2260\nTo rooted earth, and now it braves the tides.\nHere, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore,\nWith needful ease our weary limbs restore,\nAnd the Sun\u2019s temple and his town adore.\n\u201cAnius, the priest and king, with laurel crown\u2019d, 2265\nHis hoary locks with purple fillets bound,\nWho saw my sire the Delian shore ascend,\nCame forth with eager haste to meet his friend;\nInvites him to his palace; and, in sign\nOf ancient love, their plighted hands they join. 2270\nThen to the temple of the god I went,\nAnd thus, before the shrine, my vows present:\n\u2018Give, O Thymbraeus, give a resting place\nTo the sad relics of the Trojan race;\nA seat secure, a region of their own, 2275\nA lasting empire, and a happier town.\nWhere shall we fix? where shall our labors end?\nWhom shall we follow, and what fate attend?\nLet not my pray\u2019rs a doubtful answer find;\nBut in clear auguries unveil thy mind.\u2019 2280\nScarce had I said: he shook the holy ground,\nThe laurels, and the lofty hills around;\nAnd from the tripos rush\u2019d a bellowing sound.\nProstrate we fell; confess\u2019d the present god,\nWho gave this answer from his dark abode: 2285\n\u2018Undaunted youths, go, seek that mother earth\nFrom which your ancestors derive their birth.\nThe soil that sent you forth, her ancient race\nIn her old bosom shall again embrace.\nThro\u2019 the wide world th\u2019 Aeneian house shall reign, 2290\nAnd children\u2019s children shall the crown sustain.\u2019\nThus Phoebus did our future fates disclose:\nA mighty tumult, mix\u2019d with joy, arose.\n\u201cAll are concern\u2019d to know what place the god\nAssign\u2019d, and where determin\u2019d our abode. 2295\nMy father, long revolving in his mind\nThe race and lineage of the Trojan kind,\nThus answer\u2019d their demands: \u2018Ye princes, hear\nYour pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear.\nThe fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame, 2300\nSacred of old to Jove\u2019s imperial name,\nIn the mid ocean lies, with large command,\nAnd on its plains a hundred cities stand.\nAnother Ida rises there, and we\nFrom thence derive our Trojan ancestry. 2305\nFrom thence, as \u2018t is divulg\u2019d by certain fame,\nTo the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came;\n664 The Aeneid\nThere fix\u2019d, and there the seat of empire chose,\nEre Ilium and the Trojan tow\u2019rs arose.\nIn humble vales they built their soft abodes, 2310\nTill Cybele, the mother of the gods,\nWith tinkling cymbals charm\u2019d th\u2019 Idaean woods,\nShe secret rites and ceremonies taught,\nAnd to the yoke the savage lions brought.\nLet us the land which Heav\u2019n appoints, explore; 2315\nAppease the winds, and seek the Gnossian shore.\nIf Jove assists the passage of our fleet,\nThe third propitious dawn discovers Crete.\u2019\nThus having said, the sacrifices, laid\nOn smoking altars, to the gods he paid: 2320\nA bull, to Neptune an oblation due,\nAnother bull to bright Apollo slew;\nA milk-white ewe, the western winds to please,\nAnd one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas.\nEre this, a flying rumor had been spread 2325\nThat fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled,\nExpell\u2019d and exil\u2019d; that the coast was free\nFrom foreign or domestic enemy.\n\u201cWe leave the Delian ports, and put to sea;\nBy Naxos, fam\u2019d for vintage, make our way; 2330\nThen green Donysa pass; and sail in sight\nOf Paros\u2019 isle, with marble quarries white.\nWe pass the scatter\u2019d isles of Cyclades,\nThat, scarce distinguish\u2019d, seem to stud the seas.\nThe shouts of sailors double near the shores; 2335\nThey stretch their canvas, and they ply their oars.\n\u2018All hands aloft! for Crete! for Crete!\u2019 they cry,\nAnd swiftly thro\u2019 the foamy billows fly.\nFull on the promis\u2019d land at length we bore,\nWith joy descending on the Cretan shore. 2340\nWith eager haste a rising town I frame,\nWhich from the Trojan Pergamus I name:\nThe name itself was grateful; I exhort\nTo found their houses, and erect a fort.\nOur ships are haul\u2019d upon the yellow strand; 2345\nThe youth begin to till the labor\u2019d land;\nAnd I myself new marriages promote,\nGive laws, and dwellings I divide by lot;\nWhen rising vapors choke the wholesome air,\nAnd blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year; 2350\nThe trees devouring caterpillars burn;\nParch\u2019d was the grass, and blighted was the corn:\nNor \u2018scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on high,\nWith pestilential heat infects the sky:\nMy men\u2014some fall, the rest in fevers fry. 2355\nAgain my father bids me seek the shore\nOf sacred Delos, and the god implore,\nTo learn what end of woes we might expect,\nAnd to what clime our weary course direct.\n\u201c\u2018T was night, when ev\u2019ry creature, void of cares, 2360\nThe common gift of balmy slumber shares:\nThe statues of my gods (for such they seem\u2019d),\n665 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThose gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem\u2019d,\nBefore me stood, majestically bright,\nFull in the beams of Phoebe\u2019s ent\u2019ring light. 2365\nThen thus they spoke, and eas\u2019d my troubled mind:\n\u2018What from the Delian god thou go\u2019st to find,\nHe tells thee here, and sends us to relate.\nThose pow\u2019rs are we, companions of thy fate,\nWho from the burning town by thee were brought, 2370\nThy fortune follow\u2019d, and thy safety wrought.\nThro\u2019 seas and lands as we thy steps attend,\nSo shall our care thy glorious race befriend.\nAn ample realm for thee thy fates ordain,\nA town that o\u2019er the conquer\u2019d world shall reign. 2375\nThou, mighty walls for mighty nations build;\nNor let thy weary mind to labors yield:\nBut change thy seat; for not the Delian god,\nNor we, have giv\u2019n thee Crete for our abode.\nA land there is, Hesperia call\u2019d of old, 2380\n(The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold\u2014\nTh\u2019 Oenotrians held it once,) by later fame\nNow call\u2019d Italia, from the leader\u2019s name.\nIasius there and Dardanus were born;\nFrom thence we came, and thither must return. 2385\nRise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet.\nSearch Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.\u2019\n\u201cAstonish\u2019d at their voices and their sight,\n(Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night;\nI saw, I knew their faces, and descried, 2390\nIn perfect view, their hair with fillets tied;)\nI started from my couch; a clammy sweat\nOn all my limbs and shiv\u2019ring body sate.\nTo heav\u2019n I lift my hands with pious haste,\nAnd sacred incense in the flames I cast. 2395\nThus to the gods their perfect honors done,\nMore cheerful, to my good old sire I run,\nAnd tell the pleasing news. In little space\nHe found his error of the double race;\nNot, as before he deem\u2019d, deriv\u2019d from Crete; 2400\nNo more deluded by the doubtful seat:\nThen said: \u2018O son, turmoil\u2019d in Trojan fate!\nSuch things as these Cassandra did relate.\nThis day revives within my mind what she\nForetold of Troy renew\u2019d in Italy, 2405\nAnd Latian lands; but who could then have thought\nThat Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought,\nOr who believ\u2019d what mad Cassandra taught?\nNow let us go where Phoebus leads the way.\u2019\n\u201cHe said; and we with glad consent obey, 2410\nForsake the seat, and, leaving few behind,\nWe spread our sails before the willing wind.\nNow from the sight of land our galleys move,\nWith only seas around and skies above;\nWhen o\u2019er our heads descends a burst of rain, 2415\nAnd night with sable clouds involves the main;\nThe ruffling winds the foamy billows raise;\n666 The Aeneid\nThe scatter\u2019d fleet is forc\u2019d to sev\u2019ral ways;\nThe face of heav\u2019n is ravish\u2019d from our eyes,\nAnd in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies. 2420\nCast from our course, we wander in the dark.\nNo stars to guide, no point of land to mark.\nEv\u2019n Palinurus no distinction found\nBetwixt the night and day; such darkness reign\u2019d around.\nThree starless nights the doubtful navy strays, 2425\nWithout distinction, and three sunless days;\nThe fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds,\nWe view a rising land, like distant clouds;\nThe mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight,\nAnd curling smoke ascending from their height. 2430\nThe canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply;\nFrom the rude strokes the whirling waters fly.\nAt length I land upon the Strophades,\nSafe from the danger of the stormy seas.\nThose isles are compass\u2019d by th\u2019 Ionian main, 2435\nThe dire abode where the foul Harpies reign,\nForc\u2019d by the winged warriors to repair\nTo their old homes, and leave their costly fare.\nMonsters more fierce offended Heav\u2019n ne\u2019er sent\nFrom hell\u2019s abyss, for human punishment: 2440\nWith virgin faces, but with wombs obscene,\nFoul paunches, and with ordure still unclean;\nWith claws for hands, and looks for ever lean.\n\u201cWe landed at the port, and soon beheld\nFat herds of oxen graze the flow\u2019ry field, 2445\nAnd wanton goats without a keeper stray\u2019d.\nWith weapons we the welcome prey invade,\nThen call the gods for partners of our feast,\nAnd Jove himself, the chief invited guest.\nWe spread the tables on the greensward ground; 2450\nWe feed with hunger, and the bowls go round;\nWhen from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry,\nAnd clatt\u2019ring wings, the hungry Harpies fly;\nThey snatch the meat, defiling all they find,\nAnd, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind. 2455\nClose by a hollow rock, again we sit,\nNew dress the dinner, and the beds refit,\nSecure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade,\nWhere tufted trees a native arbor made.\nAgain the holy fires on altars burn; 2460\nAnd once again the rav\u2019nous birds return,\nOr from the dark recesses where they lie,\nOr from another quarter of the sky;\nWith filthy claws their odious meal repeat,\nAnd mix their loathsome ordures with their meat. 2465\nI bid my friends for vengeance then prepare,\nAnd with the hellish nation wage the war.\nThey, as commanded, for the fight provide,\nAnd in the grass their glitt\u2019ring weapons hide;\nThen, when along the crooked shore we hear 2470\nTheir clatt\u2019ring wings, and saw the foes appear,\nMisenus sounds a charge: we take th\u2019 alarm,\nAnd our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm.\n667 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nIn this new kind of combat all employ\nTheir utmost force, the monsters to destroy. 2475\nIn vain\u2014the fated skin is proof to wounds;\nAnd from their plumes the shining sword rebounds.\nAt length rebuff\u2019d, they leave their mangled prey,\nAnd their stretch\u2019d pinions to the skies display.\nYet one remain\u2019d\u2014the messenger of Fate: 2480\nHigh on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate,\nAnd thus her dismal errand did relate:\n\u2018What! not contented with our oxen slain,\nDare you with Heav\u2019n an impious war maintain,\nAnd drive the Harpies from their native reign? 2485\nHeed therefore what I say; and keep in mind\nWhat Jove decrees, what Phoebus has design\u2019d,\nAnd I, the Furies\u2019 queen, from both relate\u2014\nYou seek th\u2019 Italian shores, foredoom\u2019d by fate:\nTh\u2019 Italian shores are granted you to find, 2490\nAnd a safe passage to the port assign\u2019d.\nBut know, that ere your promis\u2019d walls you build,\nMy curses shall severely be fulfill\u2019d.\nFierce famine is your lot for this misdeed,\nReduc\u2019d to grind the plates on which you feed.\u2019 2495\nShe said, and to the neighb\u2019ring forest flew.\nOur courage fails us, and our fears renew.\nHopeless to win by war, to pray\u2019rs we fall,\nAnd on th\u2019 offended Harpies humbly call,\nAnd whether gods or birds obscene they were, 2500\nOur vows for pardon and for peace prefer.\nBut old Anchises, off\u2019ring sacrifice,\nAnd lifting up to heav\u2019n his hands and eyes,\nAdor\u2019d the greater gods: \u2018Avert,\u2019 said he,\n\u2018These omens; render vain this prophecy, 2505\nAnd from th\u2019 impending curse a pious people free!\u2019\n\u201cThus having said, he bids us put to sea;\nWe loose from shore our haulsers, and obey,\nAnd soon with swelling sails pursue the wat\u2019ry way.\nAmidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear; 2510\nAnd next by rocky Neritos we steer:\nWe fly from Ithaca\u2019s detested shore,\nAnd curse the land which dire Ulysses bore.\nAt length Leucate\u2019s cloudy top appears,\nAnd the Sun\u2019s temple, which the sailor fears. 2515\nResolv\u2019d to breathe a while from labor past,\nOur crooked anchors from the prow we cast,\nAnd joyful to the little city haste.\nHere, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay\nTo Jove, the guide and patron of our way. 2520\nThe customs of our country we pursue,\nAnd Trojan games on Actian shores renew.\nOur youth their naked limbs besmear with oil,\nAnd exercise the wrastlers\u2019 noble toil;\nPleas\u2019d to have sail\u2019d so long before the wind, 2525\nAnd left so many Grecian towns behind.\nThe sun had now fulfill\u2019d his annual course,\nAnd Boreas on the seas display\u2019d his force:\nI fix\u2019d upon the temple\u2019s lofty door\n668 The Aeneid\nThe brazen shield which vanquish\u2019d Abas bore; 2530\nThe verse beneath my name and action speaks:\n\u2018These arms Aeneas took from conqu\u2019ring Greeks.\u2019\nThen I command to weigh; the seamen ply\nTheir sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly.\nThe sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost, 2535\nAnd skimm\u2019d along Epirus\u2019 rocky coast.\n\u201cThen to Chaonia\u2019s port our course we bend,\nAnd, landed, to Buthrotus\u2019 heights ascend.\nHere wondrous things were loudly blaz\u2019d fame:\nHow Helenus reviv\u2019d the Trojan name, 2540\nAnd reign\u2019d in Greece; that Priam\u2019s captive son\nSucceeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne;\nAnd fair Andromache, restor\u2019d by fate,\nOnce more was happy in a Trojan mate.\nI leave my galleys riding in the port, 2545\nAnd long to see the new Dardanian court.\nBy chance, the mournful queen, before the gate,\nThen solemniz\u2019d her former husband\u2019s fate.\nGreen altars, rais\u2019d of turf, with gifts she crown\u2019d,\nAnd sacred priests in order stand around, 2550\nAnd thrice the name of hapless Hector sound.\nThe grove itself resembles Ida\u2019s wood;\nAnd Simois seem\u2019d the well-dissembled flood.\nBut when at nearer distance she beheld\nMy shining armor and my Trojan shield, 2555\nAstonish\u2019d at the sight, the vital heat\nForsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat:\nShe faints, she falls, and scarce recov\u2019ring strength,\nThus, with a falt\u2019ring tongue, she speaks at length:\n\u201c\u2018Are you alive, O goddess-born?\u2019 she said, 2560\n\u2018Or if a ghost, then where is Hector\u2019s shade?\u2019\nAt this, she cast a loud and frightful cry.\nWith broken words I made this brief reply:\n\u2018All of me that remains appears in sight;\nI live, if living be to loathe the light. 2565\nNo phantom; but I drag a wretched life,\nMy fate resembling that of Hector\u2019s wife.\nWhat have you suffer\u2019d since you lost your lord?\nBy what strange blessing are you now restor\u2019d?\nStill are you Hector\u2019s?

hail again,\nPaternal ashes, now review\u2019d in vain!\nThe gods permitted not, that you, with me, 4220\nShould reach the promis\u2019d shores of Italy,\nOr Tiber\u2019s flood, what flood soe\u2019er it be.\u201d\nScarce had he finish\u2019d, when, with speckled pride,\nA serpent from the tomb began to glide;\nHis hugy bulk on sev\u2019n high volumes roll\u2019d; 4225\nBlue was his breadth of back, but streak\u2019d with scaly gold:\nThus riding on his curls, he seem\u2019d to pass\nA rolling fire along, and singe the grass.\nMore various colors thro\u2019 his body run,\n699 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThan Iris when her bow imbibes the sun. 4230\nBetwixt the rising altars, and around,\nThe sacred monster shot along the ground;\nWith harmless play amidst the bowls he pass\u2019d,\nAnd with his lolling tongue assay\u2019d the taste:\nThus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest 4235\nWithin the hollow tomb retir\u2019d to rest.\nThe pious prince, surpris\u2019d at what he view\u2019d,\nThe fun\u2019ral honors with more zeal renew\u2019d,\nDoubtful if this place\u2019s genius were,\nOr guardian of his father\u2019s sepulcher. 4240\nFive sheep, according to the rites, he slew;\nAs many swine, and steers of sable hue;\nNew gen\u2019rous wine he from the goblets pour\u2019d.\nAnd call\u2019d his father\u2019s ghost, from hell restor\u2019d.\nThe glad attendants in long order come, 4245\nOff\u2019ring their gifts at great Anchises\u2019 tomb:\nSome add more oxen: some divide the spoil;\nSome place the chargers on the grassy soil;\nSome blow the fires, and offered entrails broil.\nNow came the day desir\u2019d. The skies were bright 4250\nWith rosy luster of the rising light:\nThe bord\u2019ring people, rous\u2019d by sounding fame\nOf Trojan feasts and great Acestes\u2019 name,\nThe crowded shore with acclamations fill,\nPart to behold, and part to prove their skill. 4255\nAnd first the gifts in public view they place,\nGreen laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors\u2019 grace:\nWithin the circle, arms and tripods lie,\nIngots of gold and silver, heap\u2019d on high,\nAnd vests embroider\u2019d, of the Tyrian dye. 4260\nThe trumpet\u2019s clangor then the feast proclaims,\nAnd all prepare for their appointed games.\nFour galleys first, which equal rowers bear,\nAdvancing, in the wat\u2019ry lists appear.\nThe speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind, 4265\nBore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind:\nGyas the vast Chimaera\u2019s bulk commands,\nWhich rising, like a tow\u2019ring city stands;\nThree Trojans tug at ev\u2019ry lab\u2019ring oar;\nThree banks in three degrees the sailors bore; 4270\nBeneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar.\nSergesthus, who began the Sergian race,\nIn the great Centaur took the leading place;\nCloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood,\nFrom whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood. 4275\nFar in the sea, against the foaming shore,\nThere stands a rock: the raging billows roar\nAbove his head in storms; but, when \u2018t is clear,\nUncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear.\nIn peace below the gentle waters run; 4280\nThe cormorants above lie basking in the sun.\nOn this the hero fix\u2019d an oak in sight,\nThe mark to guide the mariners aright.\nTo bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars;\n700 The Aeneid\nThen round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores. 4285\nThe lots decide their place. Above the rest,\nEach leader shining in his Tyrian vest;\nThe common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs\nTheir temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows:\nBesmear\u2019d with oil, their naked shoulders shine. 4290\nAll take their seats, and wait the sounding sign:\nThey gripe their oars; and ev\u2019ry panting breast\nIs rais\u2019d by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress\u2019d.\nThe clangor of the trumpet gives the sign;\nAt once they start, advancing in a line: 4295\nWith shouts the sailors rend the starry skies;\nLash\u2019d with their oars, the smoky billows rise;\nSparkles the briny main, and the vex\u2019d ocean fries.\nExact in time, with equal strokes they row:\nAt once the brushing oars and brazen prow 4300\nDash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below.\nNot fiery coursers, in a chariot race,\nInvade the field with half so swift a pace;\nNot the fierce driver with more fury lends\nThe sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends, 4305\nLow to the wheels his pliant body bends.\nThe partial crowd their hopes and fears divide,\nAnd aid with eager shouts the favor\u2019d side.\nCries, murmurs, clamors, with a mixing sound,\nFrom woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound. 4310\nAmidst the loud applauses of the shore,\nGyas outstripp\u2019d the rest, and sprung before:\nCloanthus, better mann\u2019d, pursued him fast,\nBut his o\u2019er-masted galley check\u2019d his haste.\nThe Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine 4315\nWith equal oars, advancing in a line;\nAnd now the mighty Centaur seems to lead,\nAnd now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead;\nNow board to board the rival vessels row,\nThe billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below. 4320\nThey reach\u2019d the mark. Proud Gyas and his train\nIn triumph rode, the victors of the main;\nBut, steering round, he charg\u2019d his pilot stand\nMore close to shore, and skim along the sand\u2014\n\u201cLet others bear to sea!\u201d Menoetes heard; 4325\nBut secret shelves too cautiously he fear\u2019d,\nAnd, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer\u2019d.\nWith louder cries the captain call\u2019d again:\n\u201cBear to the rocky shore, and shun the main.\u201d\nHe spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw 4330\nThe bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw.\nBetwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood,\nAnd in a closer compass plow\u2019d the flood.\nHe pass\u2019d the mark; and, wheeling, got before:\nGyas blasphem\u2019d the gods, devoutly swore, 4335\nCried out for anger, and his hair he tore.\nMindless of others\u2019 lives (so high was grown\nHis rising rage) and careless of his own,\nThe trembling dotard to the deck he drew;\nThen hoisted up, and overboard he threw: 4340\n701 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThis done, he seiz\u2019d the helm; his fellows cheer\u2019d,\nTurn\u2019d short upon the shelfs, and madly steer\u2019d.\nHardly his head the plunging pilot rears,\nClogg\u2019d with his clothes, and cumber\u2019d with his years:\nNow dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain. 4345\nThe crowd, that saw him fall and float again,\nShout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh\u2019d,\nTo see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught.\nThe following Centaur, and the Dolphin\u2019s crew,\nTheir vanish\u2019d hopes of victory renew; 4350\nWhile Gyas lags, they kindle in the race,\nTo reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place;\nMnestheus pursues; and while around they wind,\nComes up, not half his galley\u2019s length behind;\nThen, on the deck, amidst his mates appear\u2019d, 4355\nAnd thus their drooping courage he cheer\u2019d:\n\u201cMy friends, and Hector\u2019s followers heretofore,\nExert your vigor; tug the lab\u2019ring oar;\nStretch to your strokes, my still unconquer\u2019d crew,\nWhom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew. 4360\nIn this, our common int\u2019rest, let me find\nThat strength of hand, that courage of the mind,\nAs when you stemm\u2019d the strong Malean flood,\nAnd o\u2019er the Syrtes\u2019 broken billows row\u2019d.\nI seek not now the foremost palm to gain; 4365\nTho\u2019 yet\u2014but, ah! that haughty wish is vain!\nLet those enjoy it whom the gods ordain.\nBut to be last, the lags of all the race!\u2014\nRedeem yourselves and me from that disgrace.\u201d\nNow, one and all, they tug amain; they row 4370\nAt the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow.\nThe sea beneath \u2018em sinks; their lab\u2019ring sides\nAre swell\u2019d, and sweat runs gutt\u2019ring down in tides.\nChance aids their daring with unhop\u2019d success;\nSergesthus, eager with his beak to press 4375\nBetwixt the rival galley and the rock,\nShuts up th\u2019 unwieldly Centaur in the lock.\nThe vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock,\nHer oars she shiver\u2019d, and her head she broke.\nThe trembling rowers from their banks arise, 4380\nAnd, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize.\nWith iron poles they heave her off the shores,\nAnd gather from the sea their floating oars.\nThe crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds,\nUrge their success, and call the willing winds; 4385\nThen ply their oars, and cut their liquid way\nIn larger compass on the roomy sea.\nAs, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes,\nRous\u2019d in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes;\nThe cavern rings with clatt\u2019ring; out she flies, 4390\nAnd leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies:\nAt first she flutters; but at length she springs\nTo smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings:\nSo Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea;\nAnd, flying with a force, that force assists his way. 4395\nSergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass\u2019d,\n702 The Aeneid\nWedg\u2019d in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast.\nIn vain the victor he with cries implores,\nAnd practices to row with shatter\u2019d oars.\nThen Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies: 4400\nThe ship, without a pilot, yields the prize.\nUnvanquish\u2019d Scylla now alone remains;\nHer he pursues, and all his vigor strains.\nShouts from the fav\u2019ring multitude arise;\nApplauding Echo to the shouts replies; 4405\nShouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro\u2019 the skies.\nThese clamors with disdain the Scylla heard,\nMuch grudg\u2019d the praise, but more the robb\u2019d reward:\nResolv\u2019d to hold their own, they mend their pace,\nAll obstinate to die, or gain the race. 4410\nRais\u2019d with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran;\nFor they can conquer, who believe they can.\nBoth urge their oars, and fortune both supplies,\nAnd both perhaps had shar\u2019d an equal prize;\nWhen to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands, 4415\nAnd succor from the wat\u2019ry pow\u2019rs demands:\n\u201cGods of the liquid realms, on which I row!\nIf, giv\u2019n by you, the laurel bind my brow,\nAssist to make me guilty of my vow!\nA snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain; 4420\nHis offer\u2019d entrails cast into the main,\nAnd ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown,\nYour grateful gift and my return shall own.\u201d\nThe choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below,\nWith virgin Panopea, heard his vow; 4425\nAnd old Portunus, with his breadth of hand,\nPush\u2019d on, and sped the galley to the land.\nSwift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies,\nAnd, darting to the port, obtains the prize.\nThe herald summons all, and then proclaims 4430\nCloanthus conqu\u2019ror of the naval games.\nThe prince with laurel crowns the victor\u2019s head,\nAnd three fat steers are to his vessel led,\nThe ship\u2019s reward; with gen\u2019rous wine beside,\nAnd sums of silver, which the crew divide. 4435\nThe leaders are distinguish\u2019d from the rest;\nThe victor honor\u2019d with a nobler vest,\nWhere gold and purple strive in equal rows,\nAnd needlework its happy cost bestows.\nThere Ganymede is wrought with living art, 4440\nChasing thro\u2019 Ida\u2019s groves the trembling hart:\nBreathless he seems, yet eager to pursue;\nWhen from aloft descends, in open view,\nThe bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey,\nWith crooked talons bears the boy away. 4445\nIn vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes,\nHis guards behold him soaring thro\u2019 the skies,\nAnd dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries.\nMnestheus the second victor was declar\u2019d;\nAnd, summon\u2019d there, the second prize he shard. 4450\nA coat of mail, brave Demoleus bore,\n703 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nMore brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore,\nIn single combat on the Trojan shore:\nThis was ordain\u2019d for Mnestheus to possess;\nIn war for his defense, for ornament in peace. 4455\nRich was the gift, and glorious to behold,\nBut yet so pond\u2019rous with its plates of gold,\nThat scarce two servants could the weight sustain;\nYet, loaded thus, Demoleus o\u2019er the plain\nPursued and lightly seiz\u2019d the Trojan train. 4460\nThe third, succeeding to the last reward,\nTwo goodly bowls of massy silver shar\u2019d,\nWith figures prominent, and richly wrought,\nAnd two brass caldrons from Dodona brought.\nThus all, rewarded by the hero\u2019s hands, 4465\nTheir conqu\u2019ring temples bound with purple bands;\nAnd now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock,\nBrought back his galley shatter\u2019d with the shock.\nForlorn she look\u2019d, without an aiding oar,\nAnd, houted by the vulgar, made to shore. 4470\nAs when a snake, surpris\u2019d upon the road,\nIs crush\u2019d athwart her body by the load\nOf heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound\nHer belly bruis\u2019d, and trodden to the ground:\nIn vain, with loosen\u2019d curls, she crawls along; 4475\nYet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue;\nGlares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales;\nBut, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails:\nSo slowly to the port the Centaur tends,\nBut, what she wants in oars, with sails amends. 4480\nYet, for his galley sav\u2019d, the grateful prince\nIs pleas\u2019d th\u2019 unhappy chief to recompense.\nPholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care,\nBeauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair.\nFrom thence his way the Trojan hero bent 4485\nInto the neighb\u2019ring plain, with mountains pent,\nWhose sides were shaded with surrounding wood.\nFull in the midst of this fair valley stood\nA native theater, which, rising slow\nBy just degrees, o\u2019erlook\u2019d the ground below. 4490\nHigh on a sylvan throne the leader sate;\nA num\u2019rous train attend in solemn state.\nHere those that in the rapid course delight,\nDesire of honor and the prize invite.\nThe rival runners without order stand; 4495\nThe Trojans mix\u2019d with the Sicilian band.\nFirst Nisus, with Euryalus, appears;\nEuryalus a boy of blooming years,\nWith sprightly grace and equal beauty crown\u2019d;\nNisus, for friendship to the youth renown\u2019d. 4500\nDiores next, of Priam\u2019s royal race,\nThen Salius joined with Patron, took their place;\n(But Patron in Arcadia had his birth,\nAnd Salius his from Arcananian earth;)\nThen two Sicilian youths\u2014the names of these, 4505\nSwift Helymus, and lovely Panopes:\n704 The Aeneid\nBoth jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred,\nAnd owning old Acestes for their head;\nWith sev\u2019ral others of ignobler name,\nWhom time has not deliver\u2019d o\u2019er to fame. 4510\nTo these the hero thus his thoughts explain\u2019d,\nIn words which gen\u2019ral approbation gain\u2019d:\n\u201cOne common largess is for all design\u2019d,\n(The vanquish\u2019d and the victor shall be join\u2019d,)\nTwo darts of polish\u2019d steel and Gnosian wood, 4515\nA silver-studded ax, alike bestow\u2019d.\nThe foremost three have olive wreaths decreed:\nThe first of these obtains a stately steed,\nAdorn\u2019d with trappings; and the next in fame,\nThe quiver of an Amazonian dame, 4520\nWith feather\u2019d Thracian arrows well supplied:\nA golden belt shall gird his manly side,\nWhich with a sparkling diamond shall be tied.\nThe third this Grecian helmet shall content.\u201d\nHe said. To their appointed base they went; 4525\nWith beating hearts th\u2019 expected sign receive,\nAnd, starting all at once, the barrier leave.\nSpread out, as on the winged winds, they flew,\nAnd seiz\u2019d the distant goal with greedy view.\nShot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o\u2019erpass\u2019d; 4530\nNor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste.\nThe next, but tho\u2019 the next, yet far disjoin\u2019d,\nCame Salius, and Euryalus behind;\nThen Helymus, whom young Diores plied,\nStep after step, and almost side by side, 4535\nHis shoulders pressing; and, in longer space,\nHad won, or left at least a dubious race.\nNow, spent, the goal they almost reach at last,\nWhen eager Nisus, hapless in his haste,\nSlipp\u2019d first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain, 4540\nSoak\u2019d with the blood of oxen newly slain.\nThe careless victor had not mark\u2019d his way;\nBut, treading where the treach\u2019rous puddle lay,\nHis heels flew up; and on the grassy floor\nHe fell, besmear\u2019d with filth and holy gore. 4545\nNot mindless then, Euryalus, of thee,\nNor of the sacred bonds of amity,\nHe strove th\u2019 immediate rival\u2019s hope to cross,\nAnd caught the foot of Salius as he rose.\nSo Salius lay extended on the plain; 4550\nEuryalus springs out, the prize to gain,\nAnd leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend\nThe victor to the goal, who vanquish\u2019d by his friend.\nNext Helymus; and then Diores came,\nBy two misfortunes made the third in fame. 4555\nBut Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud\nFor justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd;\nUrges his cause may in the court be heard;\nAnd pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr\u2019d.\nBut favor for Euryalus appears; 4560\n705 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nHis blooming beauty, with his tender tears,\nHad brib\u2019d the judges for the promis\u2019d prize.\nBesides, Diores fills the court with cries,\nWho vainly reaches at the last reward,\nIf the first palm on Salius be conferr\u2019d. 4565\nThen thus the prince: \u201cLet no disputes arise:\nWhere fortune plac\u2019d it, I award the prize.\nBut fortune\u2019s errors give me leave to mend,\nAt least to pity my deserving friend.\u201d\nHe said, and, from among the spoils, he draws 4570\n(Pond\u2019rous with shaggy mane and golden paws)\nA lion\u2019s hide: to Salius this he gives.\nNisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves.\n\u201cIf such rewards to vanquish\u2019d men are due.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cand falling is to rise by you, 4575\nWhat prize may Nisus from your bounty claim,\nWho merited the first rewards and fame?\nIn falling, both an equal fortune tried;\nWould fortune for my fall so well provide!\u201d\nWith this he pointed to his face, and show\u2019d 4580\nHis hand and all his habit smear\u2019d with blood.\nTh\u2019 indulgent father of the people smil\u2019d,\nAnd caus\u2019d to be produc\u2019d an ample shield,\nOf wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought,\nLong since from Neptune\u2019s bars in triumph brought. 4585\nThis giv\u2019n to Nisus, he divides the rest,\nAnd equal justice in his gifts express\u2019d.\nThe race thus ended, and rewards bestow\u2019d,\nOnce more the prince bespeaks th\u2019 attentive crowd:\n\u201cIf there he here whose dauntless courage dare 4590\nIn gauntlet-fight, with limbs and body bare,\nHis opposite sustain in open view,\nStand forth the champion, and the games renew.\nTwo prizes I propose, and thus divide:\nA bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied, 4595\nShall be the portion of the conqu\u2019ring chief;\nA sword and helm shall cheer the loser\u2019s grief.\u201d\nThen haughty Dares in the lists appears;\nStalking he strides, his head erected bears:\nHis nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield, 4600\nAnd loud applauses echo thro\u2019 the field.\nDares alone in combat us\u2019d to stand\nThe match of mighty Paris, hand to hand;\nThe same, at Hector\u2019s fun\u2019rals, undertook\nGigantic Butes, of th\u2019 Amycian stock, 4605\nAnd, by the stroke of his resistless hand,\nStretch\u2019d the vast bulk upon the yellow sand.\nSuch Dares was; and such he strode along,\nAnd drew the wonder of the gazing throng.\nHis brawny back and ample breast he shows, 4610\nHis lifted arms around his head he throws,\nAnd deals in whistling air his empty blows.\nHis match is sought; but, thro\u2019 the trembling band,\nNot one dares answer to the proud demand.\nPresuming of his force, with sparkling eyes 4615\n706 The Aeneid\nAlready he devours the promis\u2019d prize.\nHe claims the bull with awless insolence,\nAnd having seiz\u2019d his horns, accosts the prince:\n\u201cIf none my matchless valor dares oppose,\nHow long shall Dares wait his dastard foes? 4620\nPermit me, chief, permit without delay,\nTo lead this uncontended gift away.\u201d\nThe crowd assents, and with redoubled cries\nFor the proud challenger demands the prize.\nAcestes, fir\u2019d with just disdain, to see 4625\nThe palm usurp\u2019d without a victory,\nReproach\u2019d Entellus thus, who sate beside,\nAnd heard and saw, unmov\u2019d, the Trojan\u2019s pride:\n\u201cOnce, but in vain, a champion of renown,\nSo tamely can you bear the ravish\u2019d crown, 4630\nA prize in triumph borne before your sight,\nAnd shun, for fear, the danger of the fight?\nWhere is our Eryx now, the boasted name,\nThe god who taught your thund\u2019ring arm the game?\nWhere now your baffled honor? Where the spoil 4635\nThat fill\u2019d your house, and fame that fill\u2019d our isle?\u201d\nEntellus, thus: \u201cMy soul is still the same,\nUnmov\u2019d with fear, and mov\u2019d with martial fame;\nBut my chill blood is curdled in my veins,\nAnd scarce the shadow of a man remains. 4640\nO could I turn to that fair prime again,\nThat prime of which this boaster is so vain,\nThe brave, who this decrepid age defies,\nShould feel my force, without the promis\u2019d prize.\u201d\nHe said; and, rising at the word, he threw 4645\nTwo pond\u2019rous gauntlets down in open view;\nGauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield,\nAnd sheathe his hands with in the listed field.\nWith fear and wonder seiz\u2019d, the crowd beholds\nThe gloves of death, with sev\u2019n distinguish\u2019d folds 4650\nOf tough bull hides; the space within is spread\nWith iron, or with loads of heavy lead:\nDares himself was daunted at the sight,\nRenounc\u2019d his challenge, and refus\u2019d to fight.\nAstonish\u2019d at their weight, the hero stands, 4655\nAnd pois\u2019d the pond\u2019rous engines in his hands.\n\u201cWhat had your wonder,\u201d said Entellus, \u201cbeen,\nHad you the gauntlets of Alcides seen,\nOr view\u2019d the stern debate on this unhappy green!\nThese which I bear your brother Eryx bore, 4660\nStill mark\u2019d with batter\u2019d brains and mingled gore.\nWith these he long sustain\u2019d th\u2019 Herculean arm;\nAnd these I wielded while my blood was warm,\nThis languish\u2019d frame while better spirits fed,\nEre age unstrung my nerves, or time o\u2019ersnow\u2019d my head. 4665\nBut if the challenger these arms refuse,\nAnd cannot wield their weight, or dare not use;\nIf great Aeneas and Acestes join\nIn his request, these gauntlets I resign;\nLet us with equal arms perform the fight, 4670\nAnd let him leave to fear, since I resign my right.\u201d\n707 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThis said, Entellus for the strife prepares;\nStripp\u2019d of his quilted coat, his body bares;\nCompos\u2019d of mighty bones and brawn he stands,\nA goodly tow\u2019ring object on the sands. 4675\nThen just Aeneas equal arms supplied,\nWhich round their shoulders to their wrists they tied.\nBoth on the tiptoe stand, at full extent,\nTheir arms aloft, their bodies inly bent;\nTheir heads from aiming blows they bear afar; 4680\nWith clashing gauntlets then provoke the war.\nOne on his youth and pliant limbs relies;\nOne on his sinews and his giant size.\nThe last is stiff with age, his motion slow;\nHe heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro, 4685\nAnd clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow.\nYet equal in success, they ward, they strike;\nTheir ways are diff\u2019rent, but their art alike.\nBefore, behind, the blows are dealt; around\nTheir hollow sides the rattling thumps resound. 4690\nA storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies,\nAnd errs about their temples, ears, and eyes.\nNor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws\nA sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws.\nHeavy with age, Entellus stands his ground, 4695\nBut with his warping body wards the wound.\nHis hand and watchful eye keep even pace;\nWhile Dares traverses and shifts his place,\nAnd, like a captain who beleaguers round\nSome strong-built castle on a rising ground, 4700\nViews all th\u2019 approaches with observing eyes:\nThis and that other part in vain he tries,\nAnd more on industry than force relies.\nWith hands on high, Entellus threats the foe;\nBut Dares watch\u2019d the motion from below, 4705\nAnd slipp\u2019d aside, and shunn\u2019d the long descending blow.\nEntellus wastes his forces on the wind,\nAnd, thus deluded of the stroke design\u2019d,\nHeadlong and heavy fell; his ample breast\nAnd weighty limbs his ancient mother press\u2019d. 4710\nSo falls a hollow pine, that long had stood\nOn Ida\u2019s height, or Erymanthus\u2019 wood,\nTorn from the roots. The diff\u2019ring nations rise,\nAnd shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies,\nAcestus runs with eager haste, to raise 4715\nThe fall\u2019n companion of his youthful days.\nDauntless he rose, and to the fight return\u2019d;\nWith shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn\u2019d.\nDisdain and conscious virtue fir\u2019d his breast,\nAnd with redoubled force his foe he press\u2019d. 4720\nHe lays on load with either hand, amain,\nAnd headlong drives the Trojan o\u2019er the plain;\nNor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows;\nBut storms of strokes descend about his brows,\nA rattling tempest, and a hail of blows. 4725\nBut now the prince, who saw the wild increase\nOf wounds, commands the combatants to cease,\nAnd bounds Entellus\u2019 wrath, and bids the peace.\n708 The Aeneid\nFirst to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,\nAnd sooth\u2019d his sorrow for the suffer\u2019d shame. 4730\n\u201cWhat fury seiz\u2019d my friend? The gods,\u201d said he,\n\u201cTo him propitious, and averse to thee,\nHave giv\u2019n his arm superior force to thine.\n\u2018T is madness to contend with strength divine.\u201d\nThe gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore 4735\nHis faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:\nHis mouth and nostrils pour\u2019d a purple flood,\nAnd pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.\nFaintly he stagger\u2019d thro\u2019 the hissing throng,\nAnd hung his head, and trail\u2019d his legs along. 4740\nThe sword and casque are carried by his train;\nBut with his foe the palm and ox remain.\nThe champion, then, before Aeneas came,\nProud of his prize, but prouder of his fame:\n\u201cO goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host, 4745\nMark with attention, and forgive my boast;\nLearn what I was, by what remains; and know\nFrom what impending fate you sav\u2019d my foe.\u201d\nSternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull;\nAnd, on his ample forehead aiming full, 4750\nThe deadly stroke, descending, pierc\u2019d the skull.\nDown drops the beast, nor needs a second wound,\nBut sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground.\nThen, thus: \u201cIn Dares\u2019 stead I offer this.\nEryx, accept a nobler sacrifice; 4755\nTake the last gift my wither\u2019d arms can yield:\nThy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field.\u201d\nThis done, Aeneas orders, for the close,\nThe strife of archers with contending bows.\nThe mast Sergesthus\u2019 shatter\u2019d galley bore 4760\nWith his own hands he raises on the shore.\nA flutt\u2019ring dove upon the top they tie,\nThe living mark at which their arrows fly.\nThe rival archers in a line advance,\nTheir turn of shooting to receive from chance. 4765\nA helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn:\nOn the first scroll was read Hippocoon.\nThe people shout. Upon the next was found\nYoung Mnestheus, late with naval honors crown\u2019d.\nThe third contain\u2019d Eurytion\u2019s noble name, 4770\nThy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame,\nWhom Pallas urg\u2019d the treaty to confound,\nAnd send among the Greeks a feather\u2019d wound.\nAcestes in the bottom last remain\u2019d,\nWhom not his age from youthful sports restrain\u2019d. 4775\nSoon all with vigor bend their trusty bows,\nAnd from the quiver each his arrow chose.\nHippocoon\u2019s was the first: with forceful sway\nIt flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way.\nFix\u2019d in the mast the feather\u2019d weapon stands: 4780\nThe fearful pigeon flutters in her bands,\nAnd the tree trembled, and the shouting cries\nOf the pleas\u2019d people rend the vaulted skies.\n709 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThen Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove,\nWith lifted eyes, and took his aim above, 4785\nBut made a glancing shot, and missed the dove;\nYet miss\u2019d so narrow, that he cut the cord\nWhich fasten\u2019d by the foot the flitting bird.\nThe captive thus releas\u2019d, away she flies,\nAnd beats with clapping wings the yielding skies. 4790\nHis bow already bent, Eurytion stood;\nAnd, having first invok\u2019d his brother god,\nHis winged shaft with eager haste he sped.\nThe fatal message reach\u2019d her as she fled:\nShe leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground, 4795\nAnd renders back the weapon in the wound.\nAcestes, grudging at his lot, remains,\nWithout a prize to gratify his pains.\nYet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show\nAn archer\u2019s art, and boast his twanging bow. 4800\nThe feather\u2019d arrow gave a dire portent,\nAnd latter augurs judge from this event.\nChaf\u2019d by the speed, it fir\u2019d; and, as it flew,\nA trail of following flames ascending drew:\nKindling they mount, and mark the shiny way; 4805\nAcross the skies as falling meteors play,\nAnd vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay.\nThe Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare,\nAnd, trembling, turn their wonder into pray\u2019r.\nThe Dardan prince put on a smiling face, 4810\nAnd strain\u2019d Acestes with a close embrace;\nThen, hon\u2019ring him with gifts above the rest,\nTurn\u2019d the bad omen, nor his fears confess\u2019d.\n\u201cThe gods,\u201d said he, \u201cthis miracle have wrought,\nAnd order\u2019d you the prize without the lot. 4815\nAccept this goblet, rough with figur\u2019d gold,\nWhich Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old:\nThis pledge of ancient amity receive,\nWhich to my second sire I justly give.\u201d\nHe said, and, with the trumpets\u2019 cheerful sound, 4820\nProclaim\u2019d him victor, and with laurel-crown\u2019d.\nNor good Eurytion envied him the prize,\nTho\u2019 he transfix\u2019d the pigeon in the skies.\nWho cut the line, with second gifts was grac\u2019d;\nThe third was his whose arrow pierc\u2019d the mast. 4925\nThe chief, before the games were wholly done,\nCall\u2019d Periphantes, tutor to his son,\nAnd whisper\u2019d thus: \u201cWith speed Ascanius find;\nAnd, if his childish troop be ready join\u2019d,\nOn horseback let him grace his grandsire\u2019s day, 4930\nAnd lead his equals arm\u2019d in just array.\u201d\nHe said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears.\nThe crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears.\nAnd now the noble youths, of form divine,\nAdvance before their fathers, in a line; 4935\nThe riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine.\nThus marching on in military pride,\nShouts of applause resound from side to side.\n710 The Aeneid\nTheir casques adorn\u2019d with laurel wreaths they wear,\nEach brandishing aloft a cornel spear. 4940\nSome at their backs their gilded quivers bore;\nTheir chains of burnish\u2019d gold hung down before.\nThree graceful troops they form\u2019d upon the green;\nThree graceful leaders at their head were seen;\nTwelve follow\u2019d ev\u2019ry chief, and left a space between. 4945\nThe first young Priam led; a lovely boy,\nWhose grandsire was th\u2019 unhappy king of Troy;\nHis race in after times was known to fame,\nNew honors adding to the Latian name;\nAnd well the royal boy his Thracian steed became. 4950\nWhite were the fetlocks of his feet before,\nAnd on his front a snowy star he bore.\nThen beauteous Atys, with Iulus bred,\nOf equal age, the second squadron led.\nThe last in order, but the first in place, 4955\nFirst in the lovely features of his face,\nRode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed,\nQueen Dido\u2019s gift, and of the Tyrian breed.\nSure coursers for the rest the king ordains,\nWith golden bits adorn\u2019d, and purple reins. 4960\nThe pleas\u2019d spectators peals of shouts renew,\nAnd all the parents in the children view;\nTheir make, their motions, and their sprightly grace,\nAnd hopes and fears alternate in their face.\nTh\u2019 unfledg\u2019d commanders and their martial train 4965\nFirst make the circuit of the sandy plain\nAround their sires, and, at th\u2019 appointed sign,\nDrawn up in beauteous order, form a line.\nThe second signal sounds, the troop divides\nIn three distinguish\u2019d parts, with three distinguish\u2019d guides 4970\nAgain they close, and once again disjoin;\nIn troop to troop oppos\u2019d, and line to line.\nThey meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar\nWith harmless rage and well-dissembled war.\nThen in a round the mingled bodies run: 4975\nFlying they follow, and pursuing shun;\nBroken, they break; and, rallying, they renew\nIn other forms the military shew.\nAt last, in order, undiscern\u2019d they join,\nAnd march together in a friendly line. 4980\nAnd, as the Cretan labyrinth of old,\nWith wand\u2019ring ways and many a winding fold,\nInvolv\u2019d the weary feet, without redress,\nIn a round error, which denied recess;\nSo fought the Trojan boys in warlike play, 4985\nTurn\u2019d and return\u2019d, and still a diff\u2019rent way.\nThus dolphins in the deep each other chase\nIn circles, when they swim around the wat\u2019ry race.\nThis game, these carousels, Ascanius taught;\nAnd, building Alba, to the Latins brought; 4990\nShew\u2019d what he learn\u2019d: the Latin sires impart\nTo their succeeding sons the graceful art;\nFrom these imperial Rome receiv\u2019d the game,\nWhich Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name.\n711 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThus far the sacred sports they celebrate: 4995\nBut Fortune soon resum\u2019d her ancient hate;\nFor, while they pay the dead his annual dues,\nThose envied rites Saturnian Juno views;\nAnd sends the goddess of the various bow,\nTo try new methods of revenge below; 5000\nSupplies the winds to wing her airy way,\nWhere in the port secure the navy lay.\nSwiftly fair Iris down her arch descends,\nAnd, undiscern\u2019d, her fatal voyage ends.\nShe saw the gath\u2019ring crowd; and, gliding thence, 5005\nThe desart shore, and fleet without defense.\nThe Trojan matrons, on the sands alone,\nWith sighs and tears Anchises\u2019 death bemoan;\nThen, turning to the sea their weeping eyes,\nTheir pity to themselves renews their cries. 5010\n\u201cAlas!\u201d said one, \u201cwhat oceans yet remain\nFor us to sail! what labors to sustain!\u201d\nAll take the word, and, with a gen\u2019ral groan,\nImplore the gods for peace, and places of their own.\nThe goddess, great in mischief, views their pains, 5015\nAnd in a woman\u2019s form her heav\u2019nly limbs restrains.\nIn face and shape old Beroe she became,\nDoryclus\u2019 wife, a venerable dame,\nOnce blest with riches, and a mother\u2019s name.\nThus chang\u2019d, amidst the crying crowd she ran, 5020\nMix\u2019d with the matrons, and these words began:\n\u201cO wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow\u2019r,\nNor flames, destroy\u2019d, in Troy\u2019s unhappy hour!\nO wretched we, reserv\u2019d by cruel fate,\nBeyond the ruins of the sinking state! 5025\nNow sev\u2019n revolving years are wholly run,\nSince this improsp\u2019rous voyage we begun;\nSince, toss\u2019d from shores to shores, from lands to lands,\nInhospitable rocks and barren sands,\nWand\u2019ring in exile thro\u2019 the stormy sea, 5030\nWe search in vain for flying Italy.\nNow cast by fortune on this kindred land,\nWhat should our rest and rising walls withstand,\nOr hinder here to fix our banish\u2019d band?\nO country lost, and gods redeem\u2019d in vain, 5035\nIf still in endless exile we remain!\nShall we no more the Trojan walls renew,\nOr streams of some dissembled Simois view!\nHaste, join with me, th\u2019 unhappy fleet consume!\nCassandra bids; and I declare her doom. 5040\nIn sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands\n(For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands:\n\u2018With these,\u2019 said she, \u2018these wand\u2019ring ships destroy:\nThese are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.\u2019\nTime calls you now;

A banish\u2019d band,\nDriv\u2019n with Evander from th\u2019 Arcadian land,\nHave planted here, and plac\u2019d on high their walls;\nTheir town the founder Pallanteum calls, 7980\nDeriv\u2019d from Pallas, his great-grandsire\u2019s name:\nBut the fierce Latians old possession claim,\nWith war infesting the new colony.\nThese make thy friends, and on their aid rely.\nTo thy free passage I submit my streams. 7985\nWake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams;\nAnd, when the setting stars are lost in day,\nTo Juno\u2019s pow\u2019r thy just devotion pay;\nWith sacrifice the wrathful queen appease:\nHer pride at length shall fall, her fury cease. 7990\nWhen thou return\u2019st victorious from the war,\nPerform thy vows to me with grateful care.\nThe god am I, whose yellow water flows\nAround these fields, and fattens as it goes:\nTiber my name; among the rolling floods 7995\nRenown\u2019d on earth, esteem\u2019d among the gods.\nThis is my certain seat.

While yet he spoke,\nHis dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook. 8000\nHe rose, and looking up, beheld the skies\nWith purple blushing, and the day arise.\nThen water in his hollow palm he took\nFrom Tiber\u2019s flood, and thus the pow\u2019rs bespoke:\n\u201cLaurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed, 8005\nAnd Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed\nReceive Aeneas, and from danger keep.\n762 The Aeneid\nWhatever fount, whatever holy deep,\nConceals thy wat\u2019ry stores; where\u2019er they rise,\nAnd, bubbling from below, salute the skies; 8010\nThou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn\nSuffices fatness to the fruitful corn,\nFor this thy kind compassion of our woes,\nShalt share my morning song and ev\u2019ning vows.\nBut, O be present to thy people\u2019s aid, 8015\nAnd firm the gracious promise thou hast made!\u201d\nThus having said, two galleys from his stores,\nWith care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars.\nNow on the shore the fatal swine is found.\nWondrous to tell!\u2014She lay along the ground: 8020\nHer well-fed offspring at her udders hung;\nShe white herself, and white her thirty young.\nAeneas takes the mother and her brood,\nAnd all on Juno\u2019s altar are bestow\u2019d.\nThe foll\u2019wing night, and the succeeding day, 8025\nPropitious Tiber smooth\u2019d his wat\u2019ry way:\nHe roll\u2019d his river back, and pois\u2019d he stood,\nA gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood.\nThe Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore,\nBorne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar. 8030\nShouts from the land give omen to their course,\nAnd the pitch\u2019d vessels glide with easy force.\nThe woods and waters wonder at the gleam\nOf shields, and painted ships that stem the stream.\nOne summer\u2019s night and one whole day they pass 8035\nBetwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass.\nThe fiery sun had finish\u2019d half his race,\nLook\u2019d back, and doubted in the middle space,\nWhen they from far beheld the rising tow\u2019rs,\nThe tops of sheds, and shepherds\u2019 lowly bow\u2019rs, 8040\nThin as they stood, which, then of homely clay,\nNow rise in marble, from the Roman sway.\nThese cots (Evander\u2019s kingdom, mean and poor)\nThe Trojan saw, and turn\u2019d his ships to shore.\n\u2018T was on a solemn day: th\u2019 Arcadian states, 8045\nThe king and prince, without the city gates,\nThen paid their off\u2019rings in a sacred grove\nTo Hercules, the warrior son of Jove.\nThick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies,\nAnd fat of entrails on his altar fries. 8050\nBut, when they saw the ships that stemm\u2019d the flood,\nAnd glitter\u2019d thro\u2019 the covert of the wood,\nThey rose with fear, and left th\u2019 unfinish\u2019d feast,\nTill dauntless Pallas reassur\u2019d the rest\nTo pay the rites.

Trembling he springs,\nAs terror had increas\u2019d his feet with wings; 8200\nNor stay\u2019d for stairs; but down the depth he threw\nHis body, on his back the door he drew\n(The door, a rib of living rock; with pains\nHis father hew\u2019d it out, and bound with iron chains):\nHe broke the heavy links, the mountain clos\u2019d, 8205\nAnd bars and levers to his foe oppos\u2019d.\nThe wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast;\nThe fierce avenger came with bounding haste;\nSurvey\u2019d the mouth of the forbidden hold,\nAnd here and there his raging eyes he roll\u2019d. 8210\nHe gnash\u2019d his teeth; and thrice he compass\u2019d round\nWith winged speed the circuit of the ground.\nThrice at the cavern\u2019s mouth he pull\u2019d in vain,\nAnd, panting, thrice desisted from his pain.\nA pointed flinty rock, all bare and black, 8215\nGrew gibbous from behind the mountain\u2019s back;\nOwls, ravens, all ill omens of the night,\nHere built their nests, and hither wing\u2019d their flight.\nThe leaning head hung threat\u2019ning o\u2019er the flood,\nAnd nodded to the left.

With like design 8275\nThe rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine.\nMeantime the sun descended from the skies,\nAnd the bright evening star began to rise.\nAnd now the priests, Potitius at their head,\nIn skins of beasts involv\u2019d, the long procession led; 8280\nHeld high the flaming tapers in their hands,\nAs custom had prescrib\u2019d their holy bands;\nThen with a second course the tables load,\nAnd with full chargers offer to the god.\nThe Salii sing, and cense his altars round 8285\n767 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nWith Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound\u2014\nOne choir of old, another of the young,\nTo dance, and bear the burthen of the song.\nThe lay records the labors, and the praise,\nAnd all th\u2019 immortal acts of Hercules: 8290\nFirst, how the mighty babe, when swath\u2019d in bands,\nThe serpents strangled with his infant hands;\nThen, as in years and matchless force he grew,\nTh\u2019 Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew.\nBesides, a thousand hazards they relate, 8295\nProcur\u2019d by Juno\u2019s and Eurystheus\u2019 hate:\n\u201cThy hands, unconquer\u2019d hero, could subdue\nThe cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew:\nNor thy resistless arm the bull withstood,\nNor he, the roaring terror of the wood. 8300\nThe triple porter of the Stygian seat,\nWith lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet,\nAnd, seiz\u2019d with fear, forgot his mangled meat.\nTh\u2019 infernal waters trembled at thy sight;\nThee, god, no face of danger could affright; 8305\nNot huge Typhoeus, nor th\u2019 unnumber\u2019d snake,\nIncreas\u2019d with hissing heads, in Lerna\u2019s lake.\nHail, Jove\u2019s undoubted son! an added grace\nTo heav\u2019n and the great author of thy race!\nReceive the grateful off\u2019rings which we pay, 8310\nAnd smile propitious on thy solemn day!\u201d\nIn numbers thus they sung; above the rest,\nThe den and death of Cacus crown the feast.\nThe woods to hollow vales convey the sound,\nThe vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound. 8315\nThe rites perform\u2019d, the cheerful train retire.\nBetwixt young Pallas and his aged sire,\nThe Trojan pass\u2019d, the city to survey,\nAnd pleasing talk beguil\u2019d the tedious way.\nThe stranger cast around his curious eyes, 8320\nNew objects viewing still, with new surprise;\nWith greedy joy enquires of various things,\nAnd acts and monuments of ancient kings.\nThen thus the founder of the Roman tow\u2019rs:\n\u201cThese woods were first the seat of sylvan pow\u2019rs, 8325\nOf Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took\nTheir birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.\nNor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care\nOf lab\u2019ring oxen, or the shining share,\nNor arts of gain, nor what they gain\u2019d to spare. 8330\nTheir exercise the chase; the running flood\nSupplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food.\nThen Saturn came, who fled the pow\u2019r of Jove,\nRobb\u2019d of his realms, and banish\u2019d from above.\nThe men, dispers\u2019d on hills, to towns he brought, 8335\nAnd laws ordain\u2019d, and civil customs taught,\nAnd Latium call\u2019d the land where safe he lay\nFrom his unduteous son, and his usurping sway.\nWith his mild empire, peace and plenty came;\nAnd hence the golden times deriv\u2019d their name. 8340\nA more degenerate and discolor\u2019d age\n768 The Aeneid\nSucceeded this, with avarice and rage.\nTh\u2019 Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came;\nAnd Saturn\u2019s empire often chang\u2019d the name.\nThen kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest, 8345\nWith arbitrary sway the land oppress\u2019d:\nFor Tiber\u2019s flood was Albula before,\nTill, from the tyrant\u2019s fate, his name it bore.\nI last arriv\u2019d, driv\u2019n from my native home\nBy fortune\u2019s pow\u2019r, and fate\u2019s resistless doom. 8350\nLong toss\u2019d on seas, I sought this happy land,\nWarn\u2019d by my mother nymph, and call\u2019d by Heav\u2019n\u2019s command.\u201d\nThus, walking on, he spoke, and shew\u2019d the gate,\nSince call\u2019d Carmental by the Roman state;\nWhere stood an altar, sacred to the name 8355\nOf old Carmenta, the prophetic dame,\nWho to her son foretold th\u2019 Aenean race,\nSublime in fame, and Rome\u2019s imperial place:\nThen shews the forest, which, in after times,\nFierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes 8360\nA sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine\nWhere Pan below the rock had rites divine:\nThen tells of Argus\u2019 death, his murder\u2019d guest,\nWhose grave and tomb his innocence attest.\nThence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads; 8365\nNow roof\u2019d with gold, then thatch\u2019d with homely reeds.\nA reverent fear (such superstition reigns\nAmong the rude) ev\u2019n then possess\u2019d the swains.\nSome god, they knew\u2014what god, they could not tell\u2014\nDid there amidst the sacred horror dwell. 8370\nTh\u2019 Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw\nThe mighty Thund\u2019rer with majestic awe,\nWho took his shield, and dealt his bolts around,\nAnd scatter\u2019d tempests on the teeming ground.\nThen saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood 8375\nTwo stately towns, on either side the flood,)\nSaturnia\u2019s and Janicula\u2019s remains;\nAnd either place the founder\u2019s name retains.\nDiscoursing thus together, they resort\nWhere poor Evander kept his country court. 8380\nThey view\u2019d the ground of Rome\u2019s litigious hall;\n(Once oxen low\u2019d, where now the lawyers bawl;)\nThen, stooping, thro\u2019 the narrow gate they press\u2019d,\nWhen thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest:\n\u201cMean as it is, this palace, and this door, 8385\nReceiv\u2019d Alcides, then a conqueror.\nDare to be poor; accept our homely food,\nWhich feasted him, and emulate a god.\u201d\nThen underneath a lowly roof he led\nThe weary prince, and laid him on a bed; 8390\nThe stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o\u2019erspread.\nNow Night had shed her silver dews around,\nAnd with her sable wings embrac\u2019d the ground,\nWhen love\u2019s fair goddess, anxious for her son,\n(New tumults rising, and new wars begun,) 8395\nCouch\u2019d with her husband in his golden bed,\nWith these alluring words invokes his aid;\n769 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAnd, that her pleasing speech his mind may move,\nInspires each accent with the charms of love:\n\u201cWhile cruel fate conspir\u2019d with Grecian pow\u2019rs, 8400\nTo level with the ground the Trojan tow\u2019rs,\nI ask\u2019d not aid th\u2019 unhappy to restore,\nNor did the succor of thy skill implore;\nNor urg\u2019d the labors of my lord in vain,\nA sinking empire longer to sustain, 8405\nTho\u2019 much I ow\u2019d to Priam\u2019s house, and more\nThe dangers of Aeneas did deplore.\nBut now, by Jove\u2019s command, and fate\u2019s decree,\nHis race is doom\u2019d to reign in Italy:\nWith humble suit I beg thy needful art, 8410\nO still propitious pow\u2019r, that rules my heart!\nA mother kneels a suppliant for her son.\nBy Thetis and Aurora thou wert won\nTo forge impenetrable shields, and grace\nWith fated arms a less illustrious race. 8415\nBehold, what haughty nations are combin\u2019d\nAgainst the relics of the Phrygian kind,\nWith fire and sword my people to destroy,\nAnd conquer Venus twice, in conqu\u2019ring Troy.\u201d\nShe said;

10520\nOr, forcing these, the Trojan trenches gain.\u201d\nThis said, he strode with eager haste along,\nAnd bore amidst the thickest of the throng.\nLagus, the first he met, with fate to foe,\nHad heav\u2019d a stone of mighty weight, to throw: 10525\nStooping, the spear descended on his chine,\nJust where the bone distinguished either loin:\nIt stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay,\nThat scarce the victor forc\u2019d the steel away.\nHisbon came on: but, while he mov\u2019d too slow 10530\nTo wish\u2019d revenge, the prince prevents his blow;\nFor, warding his at once, at once he press\u2019d,\nAnd plung\u2019d the fatal weapon in his breast.\nThen lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust,\nWho stain\u2019d his stepdam\u2019s bed with impious lust. 10535\nAnd, after him, the Daucian twins were slain,\nLaris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain;\nSo wondrous like in feature, shape, and size,\nAs caus\u2019d an error in their parents\u2019 eyes\u2014\n809 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nGrateful mistake! but soon the sword decides 10540\nThe nice distinction, and their fate divides:\nFor Thymbrus\u2019 head was lopp\u2019d;

contagion spreads,\nAnd catching flames infect the neighb\u2019ring heads; 10560\nAround the forest flies the furious blast,\nAnd all the leafy nation sinks at last,\nAnd Vulcan rides in triumph o\u2019er the waste;\nThe pastor, pleas\u2019d with his dire victory,\nBeholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky: 10565\nSo Pallas\u2019 troops their scatter\u2019d strength unite,\nAnd, pouring on their foes, their prince delight.\nHalesus came, fierce with desire of blood;\nBut first collected in his arms he stood:\nAdvancing then, he plied the spear so well, 10570\nLadon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell.\nAround his head he toss\u2019d his glitt\u2019ring brand,\nAnd from Strymonius hew\u2019d his better hand,\nHeld up to guard his throat; then hurl\u2019d a stone\nAt Thoas\u2019 ample front, and pierc\u2019d the bone: 10575\nIt struck beneath the space of either eye;\nAnd blood, and mingled brains, together fly.\nDeep skill\u2019d in future fates, Halesus\u2019 sire\nDid with the youth to lonely groves retire:\nBut, when the father\u2019s mortal race was run, 10580\nDire destiny laid hold upon the son,\nAnd haul\u2019d him to the war, to find, beneath\nTh\u2019 Evandrian spear, a memorable death.\nPallas th\u2019 encounter seeks, but, ere he throws,\nTo Tuscan Tiber thus address\u2019d his vows: 10585\n\u201cO sacred stream, direct my flying dart,\nAnd give to pass the proud Halesus\u2019 heart!\nHis arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear.\u201d\nPleas\u2019d with the bribe, the god receiv\u2019d his pray\u2019r:\nFor, while his shield protects a friend distress\u2019d, 10590\nThe dart came driving on, and pierc\u2019d his breast.\nBut Lausus, no small portion of the war,\nPermits not panic fear to reign too far,\n810 The Aeneid\nCaus\u2019d by the death of so renown\u2019d a knight;\nBut by his own example cheers the fight. 10595\nFierce Abas first he slew; Abas, the stay\nOf Trojan hopes, and hindrance of the day.\nThe Phrygian troops escap\u2019d the Greeks in vain:\nThey, and their mix\u2019d allies, now load the plain.\nTo the rude shock of war both armies came; 10600\nTheir leaders equal, and their strength the same.\nThe rear so press\u2019d the front, they could not wield\nTheir angry weapons, to dispute the field.\nHere Pallas urges on, and Lausus there:\nOf equal youth and beauty both appear, 10605\nBut both by fate forbid to breathe their native air.\nTheir congress in the field great Jove withstands:\nBoth doom\u2019d to fall, but fall by greater hands.\nMeantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief\nOf Lausus\u2019 danger, urging swift relief. 10610\nWith his driv\u2019n chariot he divides the crowd,\nAnd, making to his friends, thus calls aloud:\n\u201cLet none presume his needless aid to join;\nRetire, and clear the field; the fight is mine:\nTo this right hand is Pallas only due; 10615\nO were his father here, my just revenge to view!\u201d\nFrom the forbidden space his men retir\u2019d.\nPallas their awe, and his stern words, admir\u2019d;\nSurvey\u2019d him o\u2019er and o\u2019er with wond\u2019ring sight,\nStruck with his haughty mien, and tow\u2019ring height. 10620\nThen to the king: \u201cYour empty vaunts forbear;\nSuccess I hope, and fate I cannot fear;\nAlive or dead, I shall deserve a name;\nJove is impartial, and to both the same.\u201d\nHe said, and to the void advanc\u2019d his pace: 10625\nPale horror sate on each Arcadian face.\nThen Turnus, from his chariot leaping light,\nAddress\u2019d himself on foot to single fight.\nAnd, as a lion\u2014when he spies from far\nA bull that seems to meditate the war, 10630\nBending his neck, and spurning back the sand\u2014\nRuns roaring downward from his hilly stand:\nImagine eager Turnus not more slow,\nTo rush from high on his unequal foe.\nYoung Pallas, when he saw the chief advance 10635\nWithin due distance of his flying lance,\nPrepares to charge him first, resolv\u2019d to try\nIf fortune would his want of force supply;\nAnd thus to Heav\u2019n and Hercules address\u2019d:\n\u201cAlcides, once on earth Evander\u2019s guest, 10640\nHis son adjures you by those holy rites,\nThat hospitable board, those genial nights;\nAssist my great attempt to gain this prize,\nAnd let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes,\nHis ravish\u2019d spoils.\u201d \u2018T was heard, the vain request;

10710\nHis plighted hand, and hospitable ties.\nFour sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,\nHe took in fight, and living victims led,\nTo please the ghost of Pallas, and expire,\nIn sacrifice, before his fun\u2019ral fire. 10715\nAt Magus next he threw: he stoop\u2019d below\nThe flying spear, and shunn\u2019d the promis\u2019d blow;\nThen, creeping, clasp\u2019d the hero\u2019s knees, and pray\u2019d:\n\u201cBy young Iulus, by thy father\u2019s shade,\nO spare my life, and send me back to see 10720\nMy longing sire, and tender progeny!\nA lofty house I have, and wealth untold,\nIn silver ingots, and in bars of gold:\nAll these, and sums besides, which see no day,\nThe ransom of this one poor life shall pay. 10725\nIf I survive, will Troy the less prevail?\nA single soul\u2019s too light to turn the scale.\u201d\nHe said.

The former wav\u2019d in air\nHis flaming sword: Aeneas couch\u2019d his spear, 10805\nUnus\u2019d to threats, and more unus\u2019d to fear.\nThen Liger thus: \u201cThy confidence is vain\nTo scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain:\nNor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode,\nNor this the chariot where Achilles rode; 10810\n814 The Aeneid\nNor Venus\u2019 veil is here, near Neptune\u2019s shield;\nThy fatal hour is come, and this the field.\u201d\nThus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan peer\nReturn\u2019d his answer with his flying spear.\nAs Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends, 10815\nProne to the wheels, and his left foot protends,\nPrepar\u2019d for fight; the fatal dart arrives,\nAnd thro\u2019 the borders of his buckler drives;\nPass\u2019d thro\u2019 and pierc\u2019d his groin: the deadly wound,\nCast from his chariot, roll\u2019d him on the ground. 10820\nWhom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite:\n\u201cBlame not the slowness of your steeds in flight;\nVain shadows did not force their swift retreat;\nBut you yourself forsake your empty seat.\u201d\nHe said, and seiz\u2019d at once the loosen\u2019d rein; 10825\nFor Liger lay already on the plain,\nBy the same shock: then, stretching out his hands,\nThe recreant thus his wretched life demands:\n\u201cNow, by thyself, O more than mortal man!\nBy her and him from whom thy breath began, 10830\nWho form\u2019d thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare\nThis forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant\u2019s pray\u2019r.\u201d\nThus much he spoke, and more he would have said;\nBut the stern hero turn\u2019d aside his head,\nAnd cut him short: \u201cI hear another man; 10835\nYou talk\u2019d not thus before the fight began.\nNow take your turn; and, as a brother should,\nAttend your brother to the Stygian flood.\u201d\nThen thro\u2019 his breast his fatal sword he sent,\nAnd the soul issued at the gaping vent. 10840\nAs storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground,\nThus rag\u2019d the prince, and scatter\u2019d deaths around.\nAt length Ascanius and the Trojan train\nBroke from the camp, so long besieg\u2019d in vain.\nMeantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man 10845\nHeld conference with his queen, and thus began:\n\u201cMy sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife,\nStill think you Venus\u2019 aid supports the strife\u2014\nSustains her Trojans\u2014or themselves, alone,\nWith inborn valor force their fortune on? 10850\nHow fierce in fight, with courage undecay\u2019d!\nJudge if such warriors want immortal aid.\u201d\nTo whom the goddess with the charming eyes,\nSoft in her tone, submissively replies:\n\u201cWhy, O my sov\u2019reign lord, whose frown I fear, 10855\nAnd cannot, unconcern\u2019d, your anger bear;\nWhy urge you thus my grief? when, if I still\n(As once I was) were mistress of your will,\nFrom your almighty pow\u2019r your pleasing wife\nMight gain the grace of length\u2019ning Turnus\u2019 life, 10860\nSecurely snatch him from the fatal fight,\nAnd give him to his aged father\u2019s sight.\nNow let him perish, since you hold it good,\nAnd glut the Trojans with his pious blood.\nYet from our lineage he derives his name, 10865\n815 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAnd, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came;\nYet he devoutly pays you rites divine,\nAnd offers daily incense at your shrine.\u201d\nThen shortly thus the sov\u2019reign god replied:\n\u201cSince in my pow\u2019r and goodness you confide, 10870\nIf for a little space, a lengthen\u2019d span,\nYou beg reprieve for this expiring man,\nI grant you leave to take your Turnus hence\nFrom instant fate, and can so far dispense.\nBut, if some secret meaning lies beneath, 10875\nTo save the short-liv\u2019d youth from destin\u2019d death,\nOr if a farther thought you entertain,\nTo change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain.\u201d\nTo whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes:\n\u201cAnd what if that request, your tongue denies, 10880\nYour heart should grant; and not a short reprieve,\nBut length of certain life, to Turnus give?\nNow speedy death attends the guiltless youth,\nIf my presaging soul divines with truth;\nWhich, O! I wish, might err thro\u2019 causeless fears, 10885\nAnd you (for you have pow\u2019r) prolong his years!\u201d\nThus having said, involv\u2019d in clouds, she flies,\nAnd drives a storm before her thro\u2019 the skies.\nSwift she descends, alighting on the plain,\nWhere the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain. 10890\nOf air condens\u2019d a specter soon she made;\nAnd, what Aeneas was, such seem\u2019d the shade.\nAdorn\u2019d with Dardan arms, the phantom bore\nHis head aloft; a plumy crest he wore;\nThis hand appear\u2019d a shining sword to wield, 10895\nAnd that sustain\u2019d an imitated shield.\nWith manly mien he stalk\u2019d along the ground,\nNor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound.\n(Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight,\nOr dreadful visions in our dreams by night.) 10900\nThe specter seems the Daunian chief to dare,\nAnd flourishes his empty sword in air.\nAt this, advancing, Turnus hurl\u2019d his spear:\nThe phantom wheel\u2019d, and seem\u2019d to fly for fear.\nDeluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled, 10905\nAnd with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed.\n\u201cWhether, O coward?\u201d (thus he calls aloud,\nNor found he spoke to wind, and chas\u2019d a cloud,)\n\u201cWhy thus forsake your bride! Receive from me\nThe fated land you sought so long by sea.\u201d 10910\nHe said, and, brandishing at once his blade,\nWith eager pace pursued the flying shade.\nBy chance a ship was fasten\u2019d to the shore,\nWhich from old Clusium King Osinius bore:\nThe plank was ready laid for safe ascent; 10915\nFor shelter there the trembling shadow bent,\nAnd skipp\u2019t and skulk\u2019d, and under hatches went.\nExulting Turnus, with regardless haste,\nAscends the plank, and to the galley pass\u2019d.\nScarce had he reach\u2019d the prow: Saturnia\u2019s hand 10920\n816 The Aeneid\nThe haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.\nWith wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea,\nAnd measures back with speed her former way.\nMeantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe,\nAnd sends his slaughter\u2019d troops to shades below. 10925\nThe guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,\nAnd flew sublime, and vanish\u2019d in a cloud.\nToo late young Turnus the delusion found,\nFar on the sea, still making from the ground.\nThen, thankless for a life redeem\u2019d by shame, 10930\nWith sense of honor stung, and forfeit fame,\nFearful besides of what in fight had pass\u2019d,\nHis hands and haggard eyes to heav\u2019n he cast;\n\u201cO Jove!\u201d he cried, \u201cfor what offense have\nDeserv\u2019d to bear this endless infamy? 10935\nWhence am I forc\u2019d, and whether am I borne?\nHow, and with what reproach, shall I return?\nShall ever I behold the Latian plain,\nOr see Laurentum\u2019s lofty tow\u2019rs again?\nWhat will they say of their deserting chief 10940\nThe war was mine: I fly from their relief;\nI led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave;\nAnd ev\u2019n from hence their dying groans receive.\nHere, overmatch\u2019d in fight, in heaps they lie;\nThere, scatter\u2019d o\u2019er the fields, ignobly fly. 10945\nGape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive!\nOr, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve!\nOn sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive;\nOr set me shipwrack\u2019d on some desart shore,\nWhere no Rutulian eyes may see me more, 10950\nUnknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame,\nLest she should follow, and my flight proclaim.\u201d\nThus Turnus rav\u2019d, and various fates revolv\u2019d:\nThe choice was doubtful, but the death resolv\u2019d.\nAnd now the sword, and now the sea took place, 10955\nThat to revenge, and this to purge disgrace.\nSometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,\nBy stretch of arms the distant shore to gain.\nThrice he the sword assay\u2019d, and thrice the flood;\nBut Juno, mov\u2019d with pity, both withstood. 10960\nAnd thrice repress\u2019d his rage;

10995\nTh\u2019 invaders dart their jav\u2019lins from afar:\nAll keep aloof, and safely shout around;\nBut none presumes to give a nearer wound:\nHe frets and froths, erects his bristled hide,\nAnd shakes a grove of lances from his side: 11000\nNot otherwise the troops, with hate inspir\u2019d,\nAnd just revenge against the tyrant fir\u2019d,\nTheir darts with clamor at a distance drive,\nAnd only keep the languish\u2019d war alive.\nFrom Coritus came Acron to the fight, 11005\nWho left his spouse betroth\u2019d, and unconsummate night.\nMezentius sees him thro\u2019 the squadrons ride,\nProud of the purple favors of his bride.\nThen, as a hungry lion, who beholds\nA gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds, 11010\nOr beamy stag, that grazes on the plain\u2014\nHe runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane,\nHe grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws;\nThe prey lies panting underneath his paws:\nHe fills his famish\u2019d maw; his mouth runs o\u2019er 11015\nWith unchew\u2019d morsels, while he churns the gore:\nSo proud Mezentius rushes on his foes,\nAnd first unhappy Acron overthrows:\nStretch\u2019d at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground;\nThe lance, besmear\u2019d with blood, lies broken in the wound. 11020\nThen with disdain the haughty victor view\u2019d\nOrodes flying, nor the wretch pursued,\nNor thought the dastard\u2019s back deserv\u2019d a wound,\nBut, running, gain\u2019d th\u2019 advantage of the ground:\nThen turning short, he met him face to face, 11025\nTo give his victor the better grace.\nOrodes falls, in equal fight oppress\u2019d:\nMezentius fix\u2019d his foot upon his breast,\n818 The Aeneid\nAnd rested lance; and thus aloud he cries:\n\u201cLo! here the champion of my rebels lies!\u201d 11030\nThe fields around with Io Paean! ring;\nAnd peals of shouts applaud the conqu\u2019ring king.\nAt this the vanquish\u2019d, with his dying breath,\nThus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death:\n\u201cNor thou, proud man, unpunish\u2019d shalt remain: 11035\nLike death attends thee on this fatal plain.\u201d\nThen, sourly smiling, thus the king replied:\n\u201cFor what belongs to me, let Jove provide;\nBut die thou first, whatever chance ensue.\u201d\nHe said, and from the wound the weapon drew. 11040\nA hov\u2019ring mist came swimming o\u2019er his sight,\nAnd seal\u2019d his eyes in everlasting night.\nBy Caedicus, Alcathous was slain;\nSacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain;\nOrses the strong to greater strength must yield; 11045\nHe, with Parthenius, were by Rapo kill\u2019d.\nThen brave Messapus Ericetes slew,\nWho from Lycaon\u2019s blood his lineage drew.\nBut from his headstrong horse his fate he found,\nWho threw his master, as he made a bound: 11050\nThe chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground;\nThen Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails:\nThe Trojan sinks, and Neptune\u2019s son prevails.\nAgis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride,\nTo single fight the boldest foe defied;

in clouds he hides his head.\nThe Trojan prince beheld him from afar, 11080\nAnd dauntless undertook the doubtful war.\n819 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nCollected in his strength, and like a rock,\nPois\u2019d on his base, Mezentius stood the shock.\nHe stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes\nThe space his spear could reach, aloud he cries: 11085\n\u201cMy strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke!\n(Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.)\nHis armor, from the Trojan pirate torn,\nBy my triumphant Lausus shall be worn.\u201d\nHe said; and with his utmost force he threw 11090\nThe massy spear, which, hissing as it flew,\nReach\u2019d the celestial shield, that stopp\u2019d the course;\nBut, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force\nTook a new bent obliquely, and betwixt\nThe side and bowels fam\u2019d Anthores fix\u2019d. 11095\nAnthores had from Argos travel\u2019d far,\nAlcides\u2019 friend, and brother of the war;\nTill, tir\u2019d with toils, fair Italy he chose,\nAnd in Evander\u2019s palace sought repose.\nNow, falling by another\u2019s wound, his eyes 11100\nHe cast to heav\u2019n, on Argos thinks, and dies.\nThe pious Trojan then his jav\u2019lin sent;\nThe shield gave way; thro\u2019 treble plates it went\nOf solid brass, of linen trebly roll\u2019d,\nAnd three bull hides which round the buckler fold. 11105\nAll these it pass\u2019d, resistless in the course,\nTranspierc\u2019d his thigh, and spent its dying force.\nThe gaping wound gush\u2019d out a crimson flood.\nThe Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood,\nHis faunchion drew, to closer fight address\u2019d, 11110\nAnd with new force his fainting foe oppress\u2019d.\nHis father\u2019s peril Lausus view\u2019d with grief;\nHe sigh\u2019d, he wept, he ran to his relief.\nAnd here, heroic youth, \u2018t is here I must\nTo thy immortal memory be just, 11115\nAnd sing an act so noble and so new,\nPosterity will scarce believe \u2018t is true.\nPain\u2019d with his wound, and useless for the fight,\nThe father sought to save himself by flight:\nIncumber\u2019d, slow he dragg\u2019d the spear along, 11120\nWhich pierc\u2019d his thigh, and in his buckler hung.\nThe pious youth, resolv\u2019d on death, below\nThe lifted sword springs forth to face the foe;\nProtects his parent, and prevents the blow.\nShouts of applause ran ringing thro\u2019 the field, 11125\nTo see the son the vanquish\u2019d father shield.\nAll, fir\u2019d with gen\u2019rous indignation, strive,\nAnd with a storm of darts to distance drive\nThe Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far,\nOn his Vulcanian orb sustain\u2019d the war. 11130\nAs, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind,\nThe plowman, passenger, and lab\u2019ring hind\nFor shelter to the neighb\u2019ring covert fly,\nOr hous\u2019d, or safe in hollow caverns lie;\n820 The Aeneid\nBut, that o\u2019erblown, when heav\u2019n above \u2018em smiles, 11135\nReturn to travel, and renew their toils:\nAeneas thus, o\u2019erwhelmed on ev\u2019ry side,\nThe storm of darts, undaunted, did abide;\nAnd thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat\u2019ning cried:\n\u201cWhy wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage 11140\nIn rash attempts, beyond thy tender age,\nBetray\u2019d by pious love?\u201d Nor, thus forborne,\nThe youth desists, but with insulting scorn\nProvokes the ling\u2019ring prince, whose patience, tir\u2019d,\nGave place; and all his breast with fury fir\u2019d. 11145\nFor now the Fates prepar\u2019d their sharpen\u2019d shears;\nAnd lifted high the flaming sword appears,\nWhich, full descending with a frightful sway,\nThro\u2019 shield and corslet forc\u2019d th\u2019 impetuous way,\nAnd buried deep in his fair bosom lay. 11150\nThe purple streams thro\u2019 the thin armor strove,\nAnd drench\u2019d th\u2019 imbroider\u2019d coat his mother wove;\nAnd life at length forsook his heaving heart,\nLoth from so sweet a mansion to depart.\nBut when, with blood and paleness all o\u2019erspread, 11155\nThe pious prince beheld young Lausus dead,\nHe griev\u2019d; he wept; the sight an image brought\nOf his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought:\nThen stretch\u2019d his hand to hold him up, and said:\n\u201cPoor hapless youth! what praises can be paid 11160\nTo love so great, to such transcendent store\nOf early worth, and sure presage of more?\nAccept whate\u2019er Aeneas can afford;\nUntouch\u2019d thy arms, untaken be thy sword;\nAnd all that pleas\u2019d thee living, still remain 11165\nInviolate, and sacred to the slain.\nThy body on thy parents I bestow,\nTo rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know,\nOr have a sense of human things below.\nThere to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell: 11170\n\u2018\u2018T was by the great Aeneas hand I fell.\u2019\u201d\nWith this, his distant friends he beckons near,\nProvokes their duty, and prevents their fear:\nHimself assists to lift him from the ground,\nWith clotted locks, and blood that well\u2019d from out the wound. 11175\nMeantime, his father, now no father, stood,\nAnd wash\u2019d his wounds by Tiber\u2019s yellow flood:\nOppress\u2019d with anguish, panting, and o\u2019erspent,\nHis fainting limbs against an oak he leant.\nA bough his brazen helmet did sustain; 11180\nHis heavier arms lay scatter\u2019d on the plain:\nA chosen train of youth around him stand;\nHis drooping head was rested on his hand:\nHis grisly beard his pensive bosom sought;\nAnd all on Lausus ran his restless thought. 11185\nCareful, concern\u2019d his danger to prevent,\nHe much enquir\u2019d, and many a message sent\nTo warn him from the field\u2014alas! in vain!\n821 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nBehold, his mournful followers bear him slain!\nO\u2019er his broad shield still gush\u2019d the yawning wound, 11190\nAnd drew a bloody trail along the ground.\nFar off he heard their cries, far off divin\u2019d\nThe dire event, with a foreboding mind.\nWith dust he sprinkled first his hoary head;\nThen both his lifted hands to heav\u2019n he spread; 11195\nLast, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said:\n\u201cWhat joys, alas! could this frail being give,\nThat I have been so covetous to live?\nTo see my son, and such a son, resign\nHis life, a ransom for preserving mine! 11200\nAnd am I then preserv\u2019d, and art thou lost?\nHow much too dear has that redemption cost!\n\u2018T is now my bitter banishment I feel:\nThis is a wound too deep for time to heal.\nMy guilt thy growing virtues did defame; 11205\nMy blackness blotted thy unblemish\u2019d name.\nChas\u2019d from a throne, abandon\u2019d, and exil\u2019d\nFor foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild:\nI ow\u2019d my people these, and, from their hate,\nWith less resentment could have borne my fate. 11210\nAnd yet I live, and yet sustain the sight\nOf hated men, and of more hated light:\nBut will not long.\u201d With that he rais\u2019d from ground\nHis fainting limbs, that stagger\u2019d with his wound;\nYet, with a mind resolv\u2019d, and unappall\u2019d 11215\nWith pains or perils, for his courser call\u2019d\nWell-mouth\u2019d, well-manag\u2019d, whom himself did dress\nWith daily care, and mounted with success;\nHis aid in arms, his ornament in peace.\nSoothing his courage with a gentle stroke, 11220\nThe steed seem\u2019d sensible, while thus he spoke:\n\u201cO Rhoebus, we have liv\u2019d too long for me\u2014\nIf life and long were terms that could agree!\nThis day thou either shalt bring back the head\nAnd bloody trophies of the Trojan dead; 11225\nThis day thou either shalt revenge my woe,\nFor murther\u2019d Lausus, on his cruel foe;\nOr, if inexorable fate deny\nOur conquest, with thy conquer\u2019d master die:\nFor, after such a lord, I rest secure, 11230\nThou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure.\u201d\nHe said; and straight th\u2019 officious courser kneels,\nTo take his wonted weight. His hands he fills\nWith pointed jav\u2019lins; on his head he lac\u2019d\nHis glitt\u2019ring helm, which terribly was grac\u2019d 11235\nWith waving horsehair, nodding from afar;\nThen spurr\u2019d his thund\u2019ring steed amidst the war.\nLove, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought,\nDespair, and secret shame, and conscious thought\nOf inborn worth, his lab\u2019ring soul oppress\u2019d, 11240\nRoll\u2019d in his eyes, and rag\u2019d within his breast.\nThen loud he call\u2019d Aeneas thrice by name:\nThe loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came.\n\u201cGreat Jove,\u201d he said, \u201cand the far-shooting god,\n822 The Aeneid\nInspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!\u201d 11245\nHe spoke no more; but hasten\u2019d, void of fear,\nAnd threaten\u2019d with his long protended spear.\nTo whom Mezentius thus: \u201cThy vaunts are vain.\nMy Lausus lies extended on the plain:\nHe\u2019s lost! thy conquest is already won; 11250\nThe wretched sire is murther\u2019d in the son.\nNor fate I fear, but all the gods defy.\nForbear thy threats: my bus\u2019ness is to die;\nBut first receive this parting legacy.\u201d\nHe said; and straight a whirling dart he sent; 11255\nAnother after, and another went.\nRound in a spacious ring he rides the field,\nAnd vainly plies th\u2019 impenetrable shield.\nThrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel\u2019d,\nTurn\u2019d as he turn\u2019d: the golden orb withstood 11260\nThe strokes, and bore about an iron wood.\nImpatient of delay, and weary grown,\nStill to defend, and to defend alone,\nTo wrench the darts which in his buckler light,\nUrg\u2019d and o\u2019er-labor\u2019d in unequal fight; 11265\nAt length resolv\u2019d, he throws with all his force\nFull at the temples of the warrior horse.\nJust where the stroke was aim\u2019d, th\u2019 unerring spear\nMade way, and stood transfix\u2019d thro\u2019 either ear.\nSeiz\u2019d with unwonted pain, surpris\u2019d with fright, 11270\nThe wounded steed curvets, and, rais\u2019d upright,\nLights on his feet before; his hoofs behind\nSpring up in air aloft, and lash the wind.\nDown comes the rider headlong from his height:\nHis horse came after with unwieldy weight, 11275\nAnd, flound\u2019ring forward, pitching on his head,\nHis lord\u2019s incumber\u2019d shoulder overlaid.\nFrom either host, the mingled shouts and cries\nOf Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies.\nAeneas, hast\u2019ning, wav\u2019d his fatal sword 11280\nHigh o\u2019er his head, with this reproachful word:\n\u201cNow; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain\nOf proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?\u201d\nStruggling, and wildly staring on the skies,\nWith scarce recover\u2019d sight he thus replies: 11285\n\u201cWhy these insulting words, this waste of breath,\nTo souls undaunted, and secure of death?\n\u2018T is no dishonor for the brave to die,\nNor came I here with hope victory;\nNor ask I life, nor fought with that design: 11290\nAs I had us\u2019d my fortune, use thou thine.\nMy dying son contracted no such band;\nThe gift is hateful from his murd\u2019rer\u2019s hand.\nFor this, this only favor let me sue,\nIf pity can to conquer\u2019d foes be due: 11295\nRefuse it not; but let my body have\nThe last retreat of humankind, a grave.\nToo well I know th\u2019 insulting people\u2019s hate;\n823 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nProtect me from their vengeance after fate:\nThis refuge for my poor remains provide, 11300\nAnd lay my much-lov\u2019d Lausus by my side.\u201d\nHe said, and to the sword his throat applied.\nThe crimson stream distain\u2019d his arms around,\nAnd the disdainful soul came rushing thro\u2019 the wound.\nBook XI\nScarce had the rosy Morning rais\u2019d her head 11305\nAbove the waves, and left her wat\u2019ry bed;\nThe pious chief, whom double cares attend\nFor his unburied soldiers and his friend,\nYet first to Heav\u2019n perform\u2019d a victor\u2019s vows:\nHe bar\u2019d an ancient oak of all her boughs; 11310\nThen on a rising ground the trunk he plac\u2019d,\nWhich with the spoils of his dead foe he grac\u2019d.\nThe coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn,\nNow on a naked snag in triumph borne,\nWas hung on high, and glitter\u2019d from afar, 11315\nA trophy sacred to the God of War.\nAbove his arms, fix\u2019d on the leafless wood,\nAppear\u2019d his plumy crest, besmear\u2019d with blood:\nHis brazen buckler on the left was seen;\nTruncheons of shiver\u2019d lances hung between; 11320\nAnd on the right was placed his corslet, bor\u2019d;\nAnd to the neck was tied his unavailing sword.\nA crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man,\nWho thus, conspicuous in the midst, began:\n\u201cOur toils, my friends, are crown\u2019d with sure success; 11325\nThe greater part perform\u2019d, achieve the less.\nNow follow cheerful to the trembling town;\nPress but an entrance, and presume it won.\nFear is no more, for fierce Mezentius lies,\nAs the first fruits of war, a sacrifice. 11330\nTurnus shall fall extended on the plain,\nAnd, in this omen, is already slain.\nPrepar\u2019d in arms, pursue your happy chance;\nThat none unwarn\u2019d may plead his ignorance,\nAnd I, at Heav\u2019n\u2019s appointed hour, may find 11335\nYour warlike ensigns waving in the wind.\nMeantime the rites and fun\u2019ral pomps prepare,\nDue to your dead companions of the war:\nThe last respect the living can bestow,\nTo shield their shadows from contempt below. 11340\nThat conquer\u2019d earth be theirs, for which they fought,\nAnd which for us with their own blood they bought;\nBut first the corpse of our unhappy friend\nTo the sad city of Evander send,\nWho, not inglorious, in his age\u2019s bloom, 11345\nWas hurried hence by too severe a doom.\u201d\nThus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way,\nWhere, new in death, lamented Pallas lay.\nAcoetes watch\u2019d the corpse; whose youth deserv\u2019d\nThe father\u2019s trust; and now the son he serv\u2019d 11350\nWith equal faith, but less auspicious care.\n824 The Aeneid\nTh\u2019 attendants of the slain his sorrow share.\nA troop of Trojans mix\u2019d with these appear,\nAnd mourning matrons with dishevel\u2019d hair.\nSoon as the prince appears, they raise a cry; 11355\nAll beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky.\nThey rear his drooping forehead from the ground;\nBut, when Aeneas view\u2019d the grisly wound\nWhich Pallas in his manly bosom bore,\nAnd the fair flesh distain\u2019d with purple gore; 11360\nFirst, melting into tears, the pious man\nDeplor\u2019d so sad a sight, then thus began:\n\u201cUnhappy youth! when Fortune gave the rest\nOf my full wishes, she refus\u2019d the best!\nShe came; but brought not thee along, to bless 11365\nMy longing eyes, and share in my success:\nShe grudg\u2019d thy safe return, the triumphs due\nTo prosp\u2019rous valor, in the public view.\nNot thus I promis\u2019d, when thy father lent\nThy needless succor with a sad consent; 11370\nEmbrac\u2019d me, parting for th\u2019 Etrurian land,\nAnd sent me to possess a large command.\nHe warn\u2019d, and from his own experience told,\nOur foes were warlike, disciplin\u2019d, and bold.\nAnd now perhaps, in hopes of thy return, 11375\nRich odors on his loaded altars burn,\nWhile we, with vain officious pomp, prepare\nTo send him back his portion of the war,\nA bloody breathless body, which can owe\nNo farther debt, but to the pow\u2019rs below. 11380\nThe wretched father, ere his race is run,\nShall view the fun\u2019ral honors of his son.\nThese are my triumphs of the Latian war,\nFruits of my plighted faith and boasted care!\nAnd yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see 11385\nA son whose death disgrac\u2019d his ancestry;\nThou shalt not blush, old man, however griev\u2019d:\nThy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv\u2019d.\nHe died no death to make thee wish, too late,\nThou hadst not liv\u2019d to see his shameful fate: 11390\nBut what a champion has th\u2019 Ausonian coast,\nAnd what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!\u201d\nThus having mourn\u2019d, he gave the word around,\nTo raise the breathless body from the ground;\nAnd chose a thousand horse, the flow\u2019r of all 11395\nHis warlike troops, to wait the funeral,\nTo bear him back and share Evander\u2019s grief:\nA well-becoming, but a weak relief.\nOf oaken twigs they twist an easy bier,\nThen on their shoulders the sad burden rear. 11400\nThe body on this rural hearse is borne:\nStrew\u2019d leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn.\nAll pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow\u2019r,\nNew cropp\u2019d by virgin hands, to dress the bow\u2019r:\nUnfaded yet, but yet unfed below, 11405\nNo more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe.\nThen two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost,\nOf purple woven, and with gold emboss\u2019d,\n825 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nFor ornament the Trojan hero brought,\nWhich with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought. 11410\nOne vest array\u2019d the corpse; and one they spread\nO\u2019er his clos\u2019d eyes, and wrapp\u2019d around his head,\nThat, when the yellow hair in flame should fall,\nThe catching fire might burn the golden caul.\nBesides, the spoils of foes in battle slain, 11415\nWhen he descended on the Latian plain;\nArms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led\nIn long array\u2014th\u2019 achievements of the dead.\nThen, pinion\u2019d with their hands behind, appear\nTh\u2019 unhappy captives, marching in the rear, 11420\nAppointed off\u2019rings in the victor\u2019s name,\nTo sprinkle with their blood the fun\u2019ral flame.\nInferior trophies by the chiefs are borne;\nGauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn;\nAnd fair inscriptions fix\u2019d, and titles read 11425\nOf Latian leaders conquer\u2019d by the dead.\nAcoetes on his pupil\u2019s corpse attends,\nWith feeble steps, supported by his friends.\nPausing at ev\u2019ry pace, in sorrow drown\u2019d,\nBetwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground; 11430\nWhere grov\u2019ling while he lies in deep despair,\nHe beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair.\nThe champion\u2019s chariot next is seen to roll,\nBesmear\u2019d with hostile blood, and honorably foul.\nTo close the pomp, Aethon, the steed of state, 11435\nIs led, the fun\u2019rals of his lord to wait.\nStripp\u2019d of his trappings, with a sullen pace\nHe walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face.\nThe lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest,\nAre borne behind: the victor seiz\u2019d the rest. 11440\nThe march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound;\nThe pikes and lances trail along the ground.\nThus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse\nTo Pallantean tow\u2019rs direct their course,\nIn long procession rank\u2019d, the pious chief 11445\nStopp\u2019d in the rear, and gave a vent to grief:\n\u201cThe public care,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich war attends,\nDiverts our present woes, at least suspends.\nPeace with the manes of great Pallas dwell!\nHail, holy relics! and a last farewell!\u201d 11450\nHe said no more, but, inly thro\u2019 he mourn\u2019d,\nRestrained his tears, and to the camp return\u2019d.\nNow suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand\nA truce, with olive branches in their hand;\nObtest his clemency, and from the plain 11455\nBeg leave to draw the bodies of their slain.\nThey plead, that none those common rites deny\nTo conquer\u2019d foes that in fair battle die.\nAll cause of hate was ended in their death;\nNor could he war with bodies void of breath. 11460\nA king, they hop\u2019d, would hear a king\u2019s request,\nWhose son he once was call\u2019d, and once his guest.\n826 The Aeneid\nTheir suit, which was too just to be denied,\nThe hero grants, and farther thus replied:\n\u201cO Latian princes, how severe a fate 11465\nIn causeless quarrels has involv\u2019d your state,\nAnd arm\u2019d against an unoffending man,\nWho sought your friendship ere the war began!\nYou beg a truce, which I would gladly give,\nNot only for the slain, but those who live. 11470\nI came not hither but by Heav\u2019n\u2019s command,\nAnd sent by fate to share the Latian land.\nNor wage I wars unjust: your king denied\nMy proffer\u2019d friendship, and my promis\u2019d bride;\nLeft me for Turnus. Turnus then should try 11475\nHis cause in arms, to conquer or to die.\nMy right and his are in dispute: the slain\nFell without fault, our quarrel to maintain.\nIn equal arms let us alone contend;\nAnd let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend. 11480\nThis is the way (so tell him) to possess\nThe royal virgin, and restore the peace.\nBear this message back, with ample leave,\nThat your slain friends may fun\u2019ral rites receive.\u201d\nThus having said\u2014th\u2019 embassadors, amaz\u2019d, 11485\nStood mute a while, and on each other gaz\u2019d.\nDrances, their chief, who harbor\u2019d in his breast\nLong hate to Turnus, as his foe profess\u2019d,\nBroke silence first, and to the godlike man,\nWith graceful action bowing, thus began: 11490\n\u201cAuspicious prince, in arms a mighty name,\nBut yet whose actions far transcend your fame;\nWould I your justice or your force express,\nThought can but equal; and all words are less.\nYour answer we shall thankfully relate, 11495\nAnd favors granted to the Latian state.\nIf wish\u2019d success our labor shall attend,\nThink peace concluded, and the king your friend:\nLet Turnus leave the realm to your command,\nAnd seek alliance in some other land: 11500\nBuild you the city which your fates assign;\nWe shall be proud in the great work to join.\u201d\nThus Drances; and his words so well persuade\nThe rest impower\u2019d, that soon a truce is made.\nTwelve days the term allow\u2019d: and, during those, 11505\nLatians and Trojans, now no longer foes,\nMix\u2019d in the woods, for fun\u2019ral piles prepare\nTo fell the timber, and forget the war.\nLoud axes thro\u2019 the groaning groves resound;\nOak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground;

and groaning there he lies, 11530\nWith silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.\nShort sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks\nA passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:\n\u201cO Pallas! thou hast fail\u2019d thy plighted word,\nTo fight with caution, not to tempt the sword! 11535\nI warn\u2019d thee, but in vain;

Thus Indian iv\u2019ry shows,\nWhich with the bord\u2019ring paint of purple glows;\nOr lilies damask\u2019d by the neighb\u2019ring rose.\nThe lover gaz\u2019d, and, burning with desire, 12740\nThe more he look\u2019d, the more he fed the fire:\nRevenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite,\nRoll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight.\nThen fixing on the queen his ardent eyes,\nFirm to his first intent, he thus replies: 12745\n\u201cO mother, do not by your tears prepare\nSuch boding omens, and prejudge the war.\nResolv\u2019d on fight, I am no longer free\nTo shun my death, if Heav\u2019n my death decree.\u201d\nThen turning to the herald, thus pursues: 12750\n\u201cGo, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news;\nDenounce from me, that, when to-morrow\u2019s light\nShall gild the heav\u2019ns, he need not urge the fight;\nThe Trojan and Rutulian troops no more\nShall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore: 12755\nOur single swords the quarrel shall decide,\nAnd to the victor be the beauteous bride.\u201d\nHe said, and striding on, with speedy pace,\nHe sought his coursers of the Thracian race.\nAt his approach they toss their heads on high, 12760\nAnd, proudly neighing, promise victory.\nThe sires of these Orythia sent from far,\nTo grace Pilumnus, when he went to war.\nThe drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white,\nNor northern winds in fleetness match\u2019d their flight. 12765\nOfficious grooms stand ready by his side;\nAnd some with combs their flowing manes divide,\nAnd others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride.\nHe sheath\u2019d his limbs in arms; a temper\u2019d mass\nOf golden metal those, and mountain brass. 12770\nThen to his head his glitt\u2019ring helm he tied,\nAnd girt his faithful fauchion to his side.\nIn his Aetnaean forge, the God of Fire\nThat fauchion labor\u2019d for the hero\u2019s sire;\nImmortal keenness on the blade bestow\u2019d, 12775\nAnd plung\u2019d it hissing in the Stygian flood.\nPropp\u2019d on a pillar, which the ceiling bore,\nWas plac\u2019d the lance Auruncan Actor wore;\nWhich with such force he brandish\u2019d in his hand,\nThe tough ash trembled like an osier wand: 12780\nThen cried: \u201cO pond\u2019rous spoil of Actor slain,\nAnd never yet by Turnus toss\u2019d in vain,\nFail not this day thy wonted force;

violate the truce:\nWho knows what changeful fortune may produce?\n\u2018T is not a crime t\u2019 attempt what I decree;\nOr, if it were, discharge the crime on me.\u201d\nShe said, and, sailing on the winged wind, 12875\nLeft the sad nymph suspended in her mind.\nAnd now pomp the peaceful kings appear:\nFour steeds the chariot of Latinus bear;\nTwelve golden beams around his temples play,\nTo mark his lineage from the God of Day. 12880\nTwo snowy coursers Turnus\u2019 chariot yoke,\nAnd in his hand two massy spears he shook:\nThen issued from the camp, in arms divine,\nAeneas, author of the Roman line;\nAnd by his side Ascanius took his place, 12885\nThe second hope of Rome\u2019s immortal race.\nAdorn\u2019d in white, a rev\u2019rend priest appears,\nAnd off\u2019rings to the flaming altars bears;\nA porket, and a lamb that never suffer\u2019d shears.\nThen to the rising sun he turns his eyes, 12890\nAnd strews the beasts, design\u2019d for sacrifice,\nWith salt and meal: with like officious care\nHe marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair.\n852 The Aeneid\nBetwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds;\nWith the same gen\u2019rous juice the flame he feeds. 12895\nAeneas then unsheath\u2019d his shining sword,\nAnd thus with pious pray\u2019rs the gods ador\u2019d:\n\u201cAll-seeing sun, and thou, Ausonian soil,\nFor which I have sustain\u2019d so long a toil,\nThou, King of Heav\u2019n, and thou, the Queen of Air, 12900\nPropitious now, and reconcil\u2019d by pray\u2019r;\nThou, God of War, whose unresisted sway\nThe labors and events of arms obey;\nYe living fountains, and ye running floods,\nAll pow\u2019rs of ocean, all ethereal gods, 12905\nHear, and bear record: if I fall in field,\nOr, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield,\nMy Trojans shall encrease Evander\u2019s town;\nAscanius shall renounce th\u2019 Ausonian crown:\nAll claims, all questions of debate, shall cease;

Then, with erected eyes and hands,\nThe Latian king before his altar stands. 12925\n\u201cBy the same heav\u2019n,\u201d said he, \u201cand earth, and main,\nAnd all the pow\u2019rs that all the three contain;\nBy hell below, and by that upper god\nWhose thunder signs the peace, who seals it with his nod;\nSo let Latona\u2019s double offspring hear, 12930\nAnd double-fronted Janus, what I swear:\nI touch the sacred altars, touch the flames,\nAnd all those pow\u2019rs attest, and all their names;\nWhatever chance befall on either side,\nNo term of time this union shall divide: 12935\nNo force, no fortune, shall my vows unbind,\nOr shake the steadfast tenor of my mind;\nNot tho\u2019 the circling seas should break their bound,\nO\u2019erflow the shores, or sap the solid ground;\nNot tho\u2019 the lamps of heav\u2019n their spheres forsake, 12940\nHurl\u2019d down, and hissing in the nether lake:\nEv\u2019n as this royal scepter\u201d (for he bore\nA scepter in his hand) \u201cshall never more\nShoot out in branches, or renew the birth:\nAn orphan now, cut from the mother earth 12945\nBy the keen ax, dishonor\u2019d of its hair,\nAnd cas\u2019d in brass, for Latian kings to bear.\u201d\n853 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nWhen thus in public view the peace was tied\nWith solemn vows, and sworn on either side,\nAll dues perform\u2019d which holy rites require; 12950\nThe victim beasts are slain before the fire,\nThe trembling entrails from their bodies torn,\nAnd to the fatten\u2019d flames in chargers borne.\nAlready the Rutulians deem their man\nO\u2019ermatch\u2019d in arms, before the fight began. 12955\nFirst rising fears are whisper\u2019d thro\u2019 the crowd;\nThen, gath\u2019ring sound, they murmur more aloud.\nNow, side to side, they measure with their eyes\nThe champions\u2019 bulk, their sinews, and their size:\nThe nearer they approach, the more is known 12960\nTh\u2019 apparent disadvantage of their own.\nTurnus himself appears in public sight\nConscious of fate, desponding of the fight.\nSlowly he moves, and at his altar stands\nWith eyes dejected, and with trembling hands; 12965\nAnd, while he mutters undistinguish\u2019d pray\u2019rs,\nA livid deadness in his cheeks appears.\nWith anxious pleasure when Juturna view\u2019d\nTh\u2019 increasing fright of the mad multitude,\nWhen their short sighs and thick\u2019ning sobs she heard, 12970\nAnd found their ready minds for change prepar\u2019d;\nDissembling her immortal form, she took\nCamertus\u2019 mien, his habit, and his look;\nA chief of ancient blood; in arms well known\nWas his great sire, and he his greater son. 12975\nHis shape assum\u2019d, amid the ranks she ran,\nAnd humoring their first motions, thus began:\n\u201cFor shame, Rutulians, can you bear the sight\nOf one expos\u2019d for all, in single fight?\nCan we, before the face of heav\u2019n, confess 12980\nOur courage colder, or our numbers less?\nView all the Trojan host, th\u2019 Arcadian band,\nAnd Tuscan army; count \u2018em as they stand:\nUndaunted to the battle if we go,\nScarce ev\u2019ry second man will share a foe. 12985\nTurnus, \u2018t is true, in this unequal strife,\nShall lose, with honor, his devoted life,\nOr change it rather for immortal fame,\nSucceeding to the gods, from whence he came:\nBut you, a servile and inglorious band, 12990\nFor foreign lords shall sow your native land,\nThose fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain\u2019d,\nWhich have so long their lazy sons sustain\u2019d.\u201d\nWith words like these, she carried her design:\nA rising murmur runs along the line. 12995\nThen ev\u2019n the city troops, and Latians, tir\u2019d\nWith tedious war, seem with new souls inspir\u2019d:\nTheir champion\u2019s fate with pity they lament,\nAnd of the league, so lately sworn, repent.\nNor fails the goddess to foment the rage 13000\nWith lying wonders, and a false presage;\n854 The Aeneid\nBut adds a sign, which, present to their eyes,\nInspires new courage, and a glad surprise.\nFor, sudden, in the fiery tracts above,\nAppears in pomp th\u2019 imperial bird of Jove: 13005\nA plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes,\nAnd o\u2019er their heads his sounding pinions shakes;\nThen, stooping on the fairest of the train,\nIn his strong talons truss\u2019d a silver swan.\nTh\u2019 Italians wonder at th\u2019 unusual sight; 13010\nBut, while he lags, and labors in his flight,\nBehold, the dastard fowl return anew,\nAnd with united force the foe pursue:\nClam\u2019rous around the royal hawk they fly,\nAnd, thick\u2019ning in a cloud, o\u2019ershade the sky. 13015\nThey cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course;\nNor can th\u2019 incumber\u2019d bird sustain their force;\nBut vex\u2019d, not vanquish\u2019d, drops the pond\u2019rous prey,\nAnd, lighten\u2019d of his burthen, wings his way.\nTh\u2019 Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight, 13020\nEager of action, and demand the fight.\nThen King Tolumnius, vers\u2019d in augurs\u2019 arts,\nCries out, and thus his boasted skill imparts:\n\u201cAt length \u2018t is granted, what I long desir\u2019d!\nThis, this is what my frequent vows requir\u2019d. 13025\nYe gods, I take your omen, and obey.\nAdvance, my friends, and charge! I lead the way.\nThese are the foreign foes, whose impious band,\nLike that rapacious bird, infest our land:\nBut soon, like him, they shall be forc\u2019d to sea 13030\nBy strength united, and forego the prey.\nYour timely succor to your country bring,\nHaste to the rescue, and redeem your king.\u201d\nHe said; and, pressing onward thro\u2019 the crew,\nPois\u2019d in his lifted arm, his lance he threw. 13035\nThe winged weapon, whistling in the wind,\nCame driving on, nor miss\u2019d the mark design\u2019d.\nAt once the cornel rattled in the skies;\nAt once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise.\nNine brothers in a goodly band there stood, 13040\nBorn of Arcadian mix\u2019d with Tuscan blood,\nGylippus\u2019 sons: the fatal jav\u2019lin flew,\nAim\u2019d at the midmost of the friendly crew.\nA passage thro\u2019 the jointed arms it found,\nJust where the belt was to the body bound, 13045\nAnd struck the gentle youth extended on the ground.\nThen, fir\u2019d with pious rage, the gen\u2019rous train\nRun madly forward to revenge the slain.\nAnd some with eager haste their jav\u2019lins throw;\nAnd some with sword in hand assault the foe. 13050\nThe wish\u2019d insult the Latine troops embrace,\nAnd meet their ardor in the middle space.\nThe Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line,\nWith equal courage obviate their design.\nPeace leaves the violated fields, and hate 13055\n855 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nBoth armies urges to their mutual fate.\nWith impious haste their altars are o\u2019erturn\u2019d,\nThe sacrifice half-broil\u2019d, and half-unburn\u2019d.\nThick storms of steel from either army fly,\nAnd clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky; 13060\nBrands from the fire are missive weapons made,\nWith chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade.\nLatinus, frighted, hastens from the fray,\nAnd bears his unregarded gods away.\nThese on their horses vault; those yoke the car; 13065\nThe rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the war.\nMessapus, eager to confound the peace,\nSpurr\u2019d his hot courser thro\u2019 the fighting prease,\nAt King Aulestes, by his purple known\nA Tuscan prince, and by his regal crown; 13070\nAnd, with a shock encount\u2019ring, bore him down.\nBackward he fell; and, as his fate design\u2019d,\nThe ruins of an altar were behind:\nThere, pitching on his shoulders and his head,\nAmid the scatt\u2019ring fires he lay supinely spread. 13075\nThe beamy spear, descending from above,\nHis cuirass pierc\u2019d, and thro\u2019 his body drove.\nThen, with a scornful smile, the victor cries:\n\u201cThe gods have found a fitter sacrifice.\u201d\nGreedy of spoils, th\u2019 Italians strip the dead 13080\nOf his rich armor, and uncrown his head.\nPriest Corynaeus, arm\u2019d his better hand,\nFrom his own altar, with a blazing brand;\nAnd, as Ebusus with a thund\u2019ring pace\nAdvanc\u2019d to battle, dash\u2019d it on his face: 13085\nHis bristly beard shines out with sudden fires;\nThe crackling crop a noisome scent expires.\nFollowing the blow, he seiz\u2019d his curling crown\nWith his left hand; his other cast him down.\nThe prostrate body with his knees he press\u2019d, 13090\nAnd plung\u2019d his holy poniard in his breast.\nWhile Podalirius, with his sword, pursued\nThe shepherd Alsus thro\u2019 the flying crowd,\nSwiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow\nFull on the front of his unwary foe. 13095\nThe broad ax enters with a crashing sound,\nAnd cleaves the chin with one continued wound;\nWarm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around\nAn iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress\u2019d,\nAnd seal\u2019d their heavy lids in endless rest. 13100\nBut good Aeneas rush\u2019d amid the bands;\nBare was his head, and naked were his hands,\nIn sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud:\n\u201cWhat sudden rage, what new desire of blood,\nInflames your alter\u2019d minds? O Trojans, cease 13105\nFrom impious arms, nor violate the peace!\nBy human sanctions, and by laws divine,\n856 The Aeneid\nThe terms are all agreed; the war is mine.\nDismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue;\nThis hand alone shall right the gods and you: 13110\nOur injur\u2019d altars, and their broken vow,\nTo this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe.\u201d\nThus while he spoke, unmindful of defense,\nA winged arrow struck the pious prince.\nBut, whether from some human hand it came, 13115\nOr hostile god, is left unknown by fame:\nNo human hand or hostile god was found,\nTo boast the triumph of so base a wound.\nWhen Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain,\nHis chiefs dismay\u2019d, his troops a fainting train, 13120\nTh\u2019 unhop\u2019d event his heighten\u2019d soul inspires:\nAt once his arms and coursers he requires;\nThen, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains,\nAnd with a ready hand assumes the reins.\nHe drives impetuous, and, where\u2019er he goes, 13125\nHe leaves behind a lane of slaughter\u2019d foes.\nThese his lance reaches; over those he rolls\nHis rapid car, and crushes out their souls:\nIn vain the vanquish\u2019d fly; the victor sends\nThe dead men\u2019s weapons at their living friends. 13130\nThus, on the banks of Hebrus\u2019 freezing flood,\nThe God of Battles, in his angry mood,\nClashing his sword against his brazen shield,\nLet loose the reins, and scours along the field:\nBefore the wind his fiery coursers fly; 13135\nGroans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky.\nWrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair\n(Dire faces, and deform\u2019d) surround the car;\nFriends of the god, and followers of the war.\nWith fury not unlike, nor less disdain, 13140\nExulting Turnus flies along the plain:\nHis smoking horses, at their utmost speed,\nHe lashes on, and urges o\u2019er the dead.\nTheir fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound,\nThe gore and gath\u2019ring dust are dash\u2019d around. 13145\nThamyris and Pholus, masters of the war,\nHe kill\u2019d at hand, but Sthenelus afar:\nFrom far the sons of Imbracus he slew,\nGlaucus and Lades, of the Lycian crew;\nBoth taught to fight on foot, in battle join\u2019d, 13150\nOr mount the courser that outstrips the wind.\nMeantime Eumedes, vaunting in the field,\nNew fir\u2019d the Trojans, and their foes repell\u2019d.\nThis son of Dolon bore his grandsire\u2019s name,\nBut emulated more his father\u2019s fame; 13155\nHis guileful father, sent a nightly spy,\nThe Grecian camp and order to descry:\nHard enterprise! and well he might require\nAchilles\u2019 car and horses, for his hire:\nBut, met upon the scout, th\u2019 Aetolian prince 13160\n857 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nIn death bestow\u2019d a juster recompense.\nFierce Turnus view\u2019d the Trojan from afar,\nAnd launch\u2019d his jav\u2019lin from his lofty car;\nThen lightly leaping down, pursued the blow,\nAnd, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe, 13165\nWrench\u2019d from his feeble hold the shining sword,\nAnd plung\u2019d it in the bosom of its lord.\n\u201cPossess,\u201d said he, \u201cthe fruit of all thy pains,\nAnd measure, at thy length, our Latian plains.\nThus are my foes rewarded by my hand; 13170\nThus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!\u201d\nThen Dares, Butes, Sybaris he slew,\nWhom o\u2019er his neck his flound\u2019ring courser threw.\nAs when loud Boreas, with his blust\u2019ring train,\nStoops from above, incumbent on the main; 13175\nWhere\u2019er he flies, he drives the rack before,\nAnd rolls the billows on th\u2019 Aegaean shore:\nSo, where resistless Turnus takes his course,\nThe scatter\u2019d squadrons bend before his force;\nHis crest of horses\u2019 hair is blown behind 13180\nBy adverse air, and rustles in the wind.\nThis haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain,\nAnd, as the chariot roll\u2019d along the plain,\nLight from the ground he leapt, and seiz\u2019d the rein.\nThus hung in air, he still retain\u2019d his hold, 13185\nThe coursers frighted, and their course controll\u2019d.\nThe lance of Turnus reach\u2019d him as he hung,\nAnd pierc\u2019d his plated arms, but pass\u2019d along,\nAnd only raz\u2019d the skin. He turn\u2019d, and held\nAgainst his threat\u2019ning foe his ample shield; 13190\nThen call\u2019d for aid: but, while he cried in vain,\nThe chariot bore him backward on the plain.\nHe lies revers\u2019d; the victor king descends,\nAnd strikes so justly where his helmet ends,\nHe lops the head. The Latian fields are drunk 13195\nWith streams that issue from the bleeding trunk.\nWhile he triumphs, and while the Trojans yield,\nThe wounded prince is forc\u2019d to leave the field:\nStrong Mnestheus, and Achates often tried,\nAnd young Ascanius, weeping by his side, 13200\nConduct him to his tent. Scarce can he rear\nHis limbs from earth, supported on his spear.\nResolv\u2019d in mind, regardless of the smart,\nHe tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart.\nThe steel remains. No readier way he found 13205\nTo draw the weapon, than t\u2019 inlarge the wound.\nEager of fight, impatient of delay,\nHe begs; and his unwilling friends obey.\nIapis was at hand to prove his art,\nWhose blooming youth so fir\u2019d Apollo\u2019s heart, 13210\nThat, for his love, he proffer\u2019d to bestow\nHis tuneful harp and his unerring bow.\nThe pious youth, more studious how to save\n858 The Aeneid\nHis aged sire, now sinking to the grave,\nPreferr\u2019d the pow\u2019r of plants, and silent praise 13215\nOf healing arts, before Phoebean bays.\nPropp\u2019d on his lance the pensive hero stood,\nAnd heard and saw, unmov\u2019d, the mourning crowd.\nThe fam\u2019d physician tucks his robes around\nWith ready hands, and hastens to the wound. 13220\nWith gentle touches he performs his part,\nThis way and that, soliciting the dart,\nAnd exercises all his heav\u2019nly art.\nAll soft\u2019ning simples, known of sov\u2019reign use,\nHe presses out, and pours their noble juice. 13225\nThese first infus\u2019d, to lenify the pain,\nHe tugs with pincers, but he tugs in vain.\nThen to the patron of his art he pray\u2019d:\nThe patron of his art refus\u2019d his aid.\nMeantime the war approaches to the tents; 13230\nTh\u2019 alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments:\nThe driving dust proclaims the danger near;\nAnd first their friends, and then their foes appear:\nTheir friends retreat; their foes pursue the rear.\nThe camp is fill\u2019d with terror and affright: 13235\nThe hissing shafts within the trench alight;\nAn undistinguish\u2019d noise ascends the sky,\nThe shouts of those who kill, and groans of those who die.\nBut now the goddess mother, mov\u2019d with grief,\nAnd pierc\u2019d with pity, hastens her relief. 13240\nA branch of healing dittany she brought,\nWhich in the Cretan fields with care she sought:\nRough is the stern, which woolly leafs surround;\nThe leafs with flow\u2019rs, the flow\u2019rs with purple crown\u2019d,\nWell known to wounded goats; a sure relief 13245\nTo draw the pointed steel, and ease the grief.\nThis Venus brings, in clouds involv\u2019d, and brews\nTh\u2019 extracted liquor with ambrosian dews,\nAnd odorous panacee.

and, rushing on, begin the war.\nThey launch their spears; then hand to hand they meet;\nThe trembling soil resounds beneath their feet:\nTheir bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high, 13670\nAnd flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly.\nCourage conspires with chance, and both ingage\nWith equal fortune yet, and mutual rage.\nAs when two bulls for their fair female fight\nIn Sila\u2019s shades, or on Taburnus\u2019 height;

From the creation of the world to the apotheosis of Julius Caesar, Ovid traces the course of mythological\nhistory, putting together a narrative based on previous written and oral sources. In the Aeneid of Virgil, Ovid\u2019s older\ncontemporary epic poet, the gods were portrayed as guiding history toward an end goal (the creation of Rome)\nwith foresight and planning. In the Metamorphoses, Ovid demonstrates how the traditional stories reveal that there\nis very little planning in the actions of the gods, who often are motivated by lust or pride. His irreverent view of the\nworld, combined with his previous (sometimes risqu\u00e9) love poetry, probably led to his exile by Emperor Augustus\nin the same year that his Metamorphoses was published. In the Middle Ages, Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses was widely\ntranslated, although often with \u201cmoralized\u201d notes alongside the text that imposed allegorical interpretations on the\nstories. For most subsequent authors, the Metamorphoses became the source book on Greek and Roman mythology.\nWritten by Laura J.

Oh lead my song in smooth and measured strains,\nfrom olden days when earth began to this completed time!\nThe Creation\nMundi origo.\nBefore the ocean and the earth appeared\u2014 before the skies had overspread them all\u2014 the face of Nature in a\nvast expanse was naught but Chaos uniformly waste. It was a rude and undeveloped mass, that nothing made\nexcept a ponderous weight; and all discordant elements confused, were there congested in a shapeless heap.\nAs yet the sun afforded earth no light, nor did the moon renew her crescent horns; the earth was not suspended\nin the air exactly balanced by her heavy weight.\nNot far along the margin of the shores had Am-\nphitrite stretched her lengthened arms,\u2014 for all\nthe land was mixed with sea and air. The land was\nsoft, the sea unfit to sail, the atmosphere opaque, to\nnaught was given a proper form, in everything was\nstrife, and all was mingled in a seething mass\u2014\nwith hot the cold parts strove, and wet with dry\nand soft with hard, and weight with empty void.\nBut God, or kindly Nature, ended strife\u2014 he\ncut the land from skies, the sea from land, the\nheavens ethereal from material air; and when were\nall evolved from that dark mass he bound the\nfractious parts in tranquil peace. The fiery element\nof convex heaven leaped from the mass devoid of\ndragging weight, and chose the summit arch to\nwhich the air as next in quality was next in place.\nThe earth more dense attracted grosser parts and\nmoved by gravity sank underneath; and last of all\nthe wide surrounding waves in deeper channels\nrolled around the globe.\nAnd when this God \u2014which one is yet un-\nknown\u2014 had carved asunder that discordant mass,\nhad thus reduced it to its elements, that every\npart should equally combine, when time began\nHe rounded out the earth and moulded it to form\na mighty globe. Then poured He forth the deeps\nand gave command that they should billow in\nthe rapid winds, that they should compass every\nshore of earth. he also added fountains, pools and\nlakes, and bound with shelving banks the slant-\ning streams, which partly are absorbed and partly\njoin the boundless ocean. Thus received amid the\nwide expanse of uncontrolled waves, they beat the Image 4.4: ovidius Metamorphosis | This frontispiece shows a bust\nshores instead of crooked banks. of Ovid surrounded by three angelic figures.\nAt His command the boundless plains extend,\nAuthor: User \u201cThuresson\u201d\nthe valleys are depressed, the woods are clothed in\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\ngreen, the stony mountains rise. And as the heav-\nLicense: Public Domain\n875 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nens are intersected on the right by two broad zones, by two that cut the left, and by a fifth consumed with ardent\nheat, with such a number did the careful God mark off the compassed weight, and thus the earth received as many\nclimes.\u2014Such heat consumes the middle zone that none may dwell therein; and two extremes are covered with\ndeep snow; and two are placed betwixt the hot and cold, which mixed together give a temperate clime; and over all\nthe atmosphere suspends with weight proportioned to the fiery sky, exactly as the weight of earth compares with\nweight of water.\nAnd He ordered mist to gather in the air and spread the clouds. He fixed the thunders that disturb our souls,\nand brought the lightning on destructive winds that also waft the cold. Nor did the great Artificer permit these\nmighty winds to blow unbounded in the pathless skies, but each discordant brother fixed in space, although His\npower can scarce restrain their rage to rend the universe. At His command to far Aurora, Eurus took his way, to\nNabath, Persia, and that mountain range first gilded by the dawn; and Zephyr\u2019s flight was towards the evening star\nand peaceful shores, warm with the setting sun; and Boreas invaded Scythia and the northern snows; and Auster\nwafted to the distant south where clouds and rain encompass his abode.\u2014 and over these He fixed the liquid sky,\ndevoid of weight and free from earthly dross.\nAnd scarcely had He separated these and fixed their certain bounds, when all the stars, which long were pressed\nand hidden in the mass, began to gleam out from the plains of heaven, and traversed, with the Gods, bright ether\nfields: and lest some part might be bereft of life the gleaming waves were filled with twinkling fish; the earth was\ncovered with wild animals; the agitated air was filled with birds.\nBut one more perfect and more sanctified, a being capable of lofty thought, intelligent to rule, was wanting still\nman was created! Did the Unknown God designing then a better world make man of seed divine? or did Pro-\nmetheus take the new soil of earth (that still contained some godly element of Heaven\u2019s Life) and use it to create the\nrace of man; first mingling it with water of new streams; so that his new creation, upright man, was made in image\nof commanding Gods? On earth the brute creation bends its gaze, but man was given a lofty countenance and was\ncommanded to behold the skies; and with an upright face may view the stars:\u2014 and so it was that shapeless clay put\non the form of man till then unknown to earth.\nQuattuor aetates. Gigantes.\nThe Four Ages\nFirst was the Golden Age. Then rectitude spontaneous in the heart prevailed, and faith. Avengers were not seen,\nfor laws unframed were all unknown and needless. Punishment and fear of penalties existed not. No harsh decrees\nwere fixed on brazen plates. No suppliant multitude the countenance of Justice feared, averting, for they dwelt with-\nout a judge in peace. Descended not the steeps, shorn from its height, the lofty pine, cleaving the trackless waves\nof alien shores, nor distant realms were known to wandering men. The towns were not entrenched for time of war;\nthey had no brazen trumpets, straight, nor horns of curving brass, nor helmets, shields nor swords. There was no\nthought of martial pomp \u2014secure a happy multitude enjoyed repose.\nThen of her own accord the earth produced a store of every fruit. The harrow touched her not, nor did the\nplowshare wound her fields. And man content with given food, and none compelling, gathered arbute fruits and\nwild strawberries on the mountain sides, and ripe blackberries clinging to the bush, and corners and sweet acorns\non the ground, down fallen from the spreading tree of Jove. Eternal Spring! Soft breathing zephyrs soothed and\nwarmly cherished buds and blooms, produced without a seed. The valleys though unplowed gave many fruits; the\nfields though not renewed white glistened with the heavy bearded wheat: rivers flowed milk and nectar, and the\ntrees, the very oak trees, then gave honey of themselves.\nWhen Saturn had been banished into night and all the world was ruled by Jove supreme, the Silver Age, though\nnot so good as gold but still surpassing yellow brass, prevailed.\nJove first reduced to years the Primal Spring, by him divided into periods four, unequal,\u2014summer, autumn,\nwinter, spring.\u2014 then glowed with tawny heat the parched air, or pendent icicles in winter froze and man stopped\ncrouching in crude caverns, while he built his homes of tree rods, bark entwined. Then were the cereals planted in\nlong rows, and bullocks groaned beneath the heavy yoke.\nThe third Age followed, called The Age of Bronze, when cruel people were inclined to arms but not to impious\ncrimes. And last of all the ruthless and hard Age of Iron prevailed, from which malignant vein great evil sprung;\nand modesty and faith and truth took flight, and in their stead deceits and snares and frauds and violence and\nwicked love of gain, succeeded.\u2014Then the sailor spread his sails to winds unknown, and keels that long had stood\non lofty mountains pierced uncharted waves. Surveyors anxious marked with metes and bounds the lands, created\nfree as light and air: nor need the rich ground furnish only crops, and give due nourishment by right required,\u2014\nthey penetrated to the bowels of earth and dug up wealth, bad cause of all our ills,\u2014 rich ores which long ago the\nearth had hid and deep removed to gloomy Stygian caves: and soon destructive iron and harmful gold were brought\n876 Metamorphoses\nto light; and War, which uses both, came forth and shook with sanguinary grip his clashing arms. Rapacity broke\nforth\u2014 the guest was not protected from his host, the father in law from his own son in law; even brothers seldom\ncould abide in peace. The husband threatened to destroy his wife, and she her husband: horrid step dames mixed\nthe deadly henbane: eager sons inquired their fathers, ages. Piety was slain: and last of all the virgin deity, Astraea\nvanished from the blood-stained earth.\nGiants\nAnd lest ethereal heights should long remain less troubled than the earth, the throne of Heaven was threatened\nby the Giants; and they piled mountain on mountain to the lofty stars. But Jove, omnipotent, shot thunderbolts\nthrough Mount Olympus, and he overturned from Ossa huge, enormous Pelion. And while these dreadful bodies\nlay overwhelmed in their tremendous bulk, (so fame reports) the Earth was reeking with the copious blood of her\ngigantic sons; and thus replete with moisture she infused the steaming gore with life renewed. So that a monument\nof such ferocious stock should be retained, she made that offspring in the shape of man; but this new race alike\ndespised the Gods, and by the greed of savage slaughter proved a sanguinary birth.\nLycaon.\nLycaon Changed to a Wolf\nWhen, from his throne supreme, the Son of Saturn viewed their deeds, he deeply groaned: and calling to his\nmind the loathsome feast Lycaon had prepared, a recent deed not common to report, his soul conceived great anger\n\u2014worthy Jove\u2014 and he convened a council. No delay detained the chosen Gods.\nWhen skies are clear a path is well defined on high, which men, because so white, have named the Milky Way.\nIt makes a passage for the deities and leads to mansions of the Thunder God, to Jove\u2019s imperial home. On either side\nof its wide way the noble Gods are seen,\ninferior Gods in other parts abide, but there the potent and renowned of Heaven have fixed their homes.\u2014It is\na glorious place, our most audacious verse might designate the \u201cPalace of High Heaven.\u201d When the Gods were seat-\ned, therefore, in its marble halls the King of all above the throng sat high, and leaning on his ivory scepter, thrice,\nand once again he shook his awful locks, wherewith he moved the earth, and seas and stars,\u2014 and thus indignantly\nbegan to speak; \u201cThe time when serpent footed giants strove to fix their hundred arms on captive Heaven, not more\nthan this event could cause alarm for my dominion of the universe. Although it was a savage enemy, yet warred we\nwith a single source derived of one. Now must I utterly destroy this mortal race wherever Nereus roars around the\nworld. Yea, by the Infernal Streams that glide through Stygian groves beneath the world, I swear it. Every method\nhas been tried. The knife must cut immedicable wounds, lest maladies infect untainted parts. \u201cBeneath my sway\nare demi gods and fauns, nymphs, rustic deities, sylvans of the hills, satyrs;\u2014all these, unworthy Heaven\u2019s abodes,\nwe should at least permit to dwell on earth which we to them bequeathed. What think ye, Gods, is safety theirs\nwhen I, your sovereign lord, the Thunder-bolt Controller, am ensnared by fierce Lycaon?\u201d Ardent in their wrath,\nthe astonished Gods demand revenge overtake this miscreant; he who dared commit such crimes. \u2018Twas even thus\nwhen raged that impious band to blot the Roman name in sacred blood of Caesar, sudden apprehensive fears of\nruin absolute astonished man, and all the world convulsed. Nor is the love thy people bear to thee, Augustus, less\nthan these displayed to Jupiter whose voice and gesture all the murmuring host restrained: and as indignant clam-\nour ceased, suppressed by regnant majesty, Jove once again broke the deep silence with imperial words; \u201cDismiss\nyour cares; he paid the penalty however all the crime and punishment now learn from this:\u2014An infamous report\nof this unholy age had reached my ears, and wishing it were false, I sloped my course from high Olympus, and\u2014al-\nthough a God\u2014 disguised in human form I viewed the world. It would delay us to recount the crimes unnumbered,\nfor reports were less than truth. \u201cI traversed Maenalus where fearful dens abound, over Lycaeus, wintry slopes of\npine tree groves, across Cyllene steep; and as the twilight warned of night\u2019s approach, I stopped in that Arcadian\ntyrant\u2019s realms and entered his inhospitable home:\u2014 and when I showed his people that a God had come, the lowly\nprayed and worshiped me, but this Lycaon mocked their pious vows and scoffing said; \u2018A fair experiment will prove\nthe truth if this be god or man.\u2019 and he prepared to slay me in the night,\u2014 to end my slumbers in the sleep of death.\nSo made he merry with his impious proof; but not content with this he cut the throat of a Molossian hostage sent to\nhim, and partly softened his still quivering limbs in boiling water, partly roasted them on fires that burned beneath.\nAnd when this flesh was served to me on tables, I destroyed his dwelling and his worthless Household Gods, with\nthunder bolts avenging. Terror struck he took to flight, and on the silent plains is howling in his vain attempts to\nspeak; he raves and rages and his greedy jaws, desiring their accustomed slaughter, turn against the sheep\u2014still ea-\nger for their blood. His vesture separates in shaggy hair, his arms are changed to legs; and as a wolf he has the same\ngrey locks, the same hard face, the same bright eyes, the same ferocious look.\n877 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThe Deluge\n\u201cThus fell one house, but not one house alone deserved to perish; over all the earth ferocious deeds prevail,\u2014all\nmen conspire in evil. Let them therefore feel the weight of dreadful penalties so justly earned, for such hath my\nunchanging will ordained.\u201d\nwith exclamations some approved the words of Jove and added fuel to his wrath, while others gave assent: but\nall deplored and questioned the estate of earth deprived of mortals. Who could offer frankincense upon the altars?\nWould he suffer earth to be despoiled by hungry beasts of prey? Such idle questions of the state of man the King of\nGods forbade, but granted soon to people earth with race miraculous, unlike the first.\nDiluvium. Deucalion et Pyrrha.\nAnd now his thunder bolts would Jove wide scatter, but he feared the flames, unnumbered, sacred ether might\nignite and burn the axle of the universe: and he remembered in the scroll of fate, there is a time appointed when\nthe sea and earth and Heavens shall melt, and fire destroy the universe of mighty labour wrought. Such weapons by\nthe skill of Cyclops forged, for different punishment he laid aside\u2014 for straightway he preferred to overwhelm the\nmortal race beneath deep waves and storms from every raining sky. And instantly he shut the Northwind in Aeolian\ncaves, and every other wind that might dispel the gathering clouds. He bade the Southwind blow:\u2014\nthe Southwind flies abroad with dripping wings, concealing in the gloom his awful face: the drenching rain de-\nscends from his wet beard and hoary locks; dark clouds are on his brows and from his wings and garments drip the\ndews: his great hands press the overhanging clouds; loudly the thunders roll; the torrents pour; Iris, the messenger\nof Juno, clad in many coloured raiment, upward draws the steaming moisture to renew the clouds.\nThe standing grain is beaten to the ground, the rustic\u2019s crops are scattered in the mire, and he bewails the long\nyear\u2019s fruitless toil.\nThe wrath of Jove was not content with powers that emanate from Heaven; he brought to aid his azure brother,\nlord of flowing waves, who called upon the Rivers and the Streams: and when they entered his impearled abode,\nNeptune, their ancient ruler, thus began; \u201cA long appeal is needless; pour ye forth in rage of power; open up your\nfountains; rush over obstacles; let every stream pour forth in boundless floods.\u201d Thus he commands, and none dis-\nsenting all the River Gods return, and opening up their fountains roll tumultuous to the deep unfruitful sea.\nAnd Neptune with his trident smote the Earth, which trembling with unwonted throes heaved up the sources\nof her waters bare; and through her open plains the rapid rivers rushed resistless, onward bearing the waving grain,\nthe budding groves, the houses, sheep and men,\u2014 and holy temples, and their sacred urns. The mansions that\nremained, resisting vast and total ruin, deepening waves concealed and whelmed their tottering turrets in the flood\nand whirling gulf. And now one vast expanse, the land and sea were mingled in the waste of endless waves\u2014a sea\nwithout a shore.\nOne desperate man seized on the nearest hill; another sitting in his curved boat, plied the long oar where he\nwas wont to plow; another sailed above his grain, above his hidden dwelling; and another hooked a fish that sport-\ned in a leafy elm. Perchance an anchor dropped in verdant fields, or curving keels were pushed through tangled\nvines; and where the gracile goat enjoyed the green, unsightly seals reposed. Beneath the waves were wondering\nNereids, viewing cities, groves and houses. Dolphins darting mid the trees, meshed in the twisted branches, beat\nagainst the shaken oak trees. There the sheep, affrayed, swim with the frightened wolf, the surging waves float tigers\nand lions: availeth naught his lightning shock the wild boar, nor avails the stag\u2019s fleet footed speed. The wandering\nbird, seeking umbrageous groves and hidden vales, with wearied pinion droops into the sea. The waves increasing\nsurge above the hills, and rising waters dash on mountain tops. Myriads by the waves are swept away, and those the\nwaters spare, for lack of food, starvation slowly overcomes at last.\nA fruitful land and fair but now submerged beneath a wilderness of rising waves, \u2018Twixt Oeta and Aonia,\nPhocis lies, where through the clouds Parnassus\u2019 summits twain point upward to the stars, unmeasured height, save\nwhich the rolling billows covered all: there in a small and fragile boat, arrived, Deucalion and the consort of his\ncouch, prepared to worship the Corycian Nymphs, the mountain deities, and Themis kind, who in that age revealed\nin oracles the voice of fate. As he no other lived so good and just, as she no other feared the Gods.\nWhen Jupiter beheld the globe in ruin covered, swept with wasting waves, and when he saw one man of myr-\niads left, one helpless woman left of myriads lone, both innocent and worshiping the Gods, he scattered all the\nclouds; he blew away the great storms by the cold northwind.\nOnce more the earth appeared to heaven and the skies appeared to earth. The fury of the main abated, for the\nOcean ruler laid his trident down and pacified the waves, and called on azure Triton.\u2014Triton arose above the wav-\ning seas, his shoulders mailed in purple shells.\u2014He bade the Triton blow, blow in his sounding shell, the wandering\nstreams and rivers to recall with signal known: a hollow wreathed trumpet, tapering wide and slender stemmed, the\nTriton took amain and wound the pearly shell at midmost sea. Betwixt the rising and the setting suns the wildered\n878 Metamorphoses\nnotes resounded shore to shore, and as it touched his lips, wet with the brine beneath his dripping beard, sounded\nretreat: and all the waters of the land and sea obeyed. Their fountains heard and ceased to flow; their waves subsid-\ned; hidden hills uprose; emerged the shores of ocean; channels filled with flowing streams; the soil appeared; the\nland increased its surface as the waves decreased: and after length of days the trees put forth, with ooze on bending\nboughs, their naked tops.\nAnd all the wasted globe was now restored, but as he viewed the vast and silent world Deucalion wept and thus\nto Pyrrha spoke; \u201cO sister! wife! alone of woman left! My kindred in descent and origin! Dearest companion of my\nmarriage bed, doubly endeared by deepening dangers borne,\u2014 of all the dawn and eve behold of earth, but you\nand I are left\u2014for the deep sea has kept the rest! And what prevents the tide from overwhelming us? Remaining\nclouds affright us. How could you endure your fears if you alone were rescued by this fate, and who would then\nconsole your bitter grief? Oh be assured, if you were buried in the waves, that I would follow you and be with you!\nOh would that by my father\u2019s art I might restore the people, and inspire this clay to take the form of man. Alas, the\nGods decreed and only we are living!\u201d, Thus Deucalion\u2019s plaint to Pyrrha;\u2014and they wept.\nAnd after he had spoken, they resolved to ask the aid of sacred oracles,\u2014 and so they hastened to Cephissian\nwaves which rolled a turbid flood in channels known. Thence when their robes and brows were sprinkled well, they\nturned their footsteps to the goddess\u2019 fane: its gables were befouled with reeking moss and on its altars every fire\nwas cold. But when the twain had reached the temple steps they fell upon the earth, inspired with awe, and kissed\nthe cold stone with their trembling lips, and said; \u201cIf righteous prayers appease the Gods, and if the wrath of high\ncelestial powers may thus be turned, declare, O Themis! whence and what the art may raise humanity? O gentle\ngoddess help the dying world!\u201d\nMoved by their supplications, she replied; \u201cDepart from me and veil your brows; ungird your robes, and cast\nbehind you as you go, the bones of your great mother.\u201d Long they stood in dumb amazement: Pyrrha, first of voice,\nrefused the mandate and with trembling lips implored the goddess to forgive\u2014she feared to violate her mother\u2019s\nbones and vex her sacred spirit. Often pondered they the words involved in such obscurity, repeating oft: and thus\nDeucalion to Epimetheus\u2019 daughter uttered speech of soothing import; \u201c Oracles are just and urge not evil deeds,\nor naught avails the skill of thought. Our mother is the Earth, and I may judge the stones of earth are bones that we\nshould cast behind us as we go.\u201d\nAnd although Pyrrha by his words was moved she hesitated to comply; and both amazed doubted the purpose\nof the oracle, but deemed no harm to come of trial. They, descending from the temple, veiled their heads and loosed\ntheir robes and threw some stones behind them. It is much beyond belief, were not receding ages witness, hard and\nrigid stones assumed a softer form, enlarging as their brittle nature changed to milder substance,\u2014till the shape\nof man appeared, imperfect, faintly outlined first, as marble statue chiseled in the rough. The soft moist parts were\nchanged to softer flesh, the hard and brittle substance into bones, the veins retained their ancient name. And now\nthe Gods supreme ordained that every stone Deucalion threw should take the form of man, and those by Pyrrha\ncast should woman\u2019s form assume: so are we hardy to endure and prove by toil and deeds from what we sprung.\nPython.\nThe Pythian Games\nAnd after this the Earth spontaneous produced the world of animals, when all remaining moistures of the\nmirey fens fermented in the sun, and fruitful seeds in soils nutritious grew to shapes ordained. So when the seven\nstreamed Nile from oozy fields returneth duly to her ancient bed, the sun\u2019s ethereal rays impregn the slime, that\nhaply as the peasants turn the soil they find strange animals unknown before: some in the moment of their birth,\nand some deprived of limbs, imperfect; often part alive and part of slime inanimate are fashioned in one body. Heat\ncombined with moisture so conceives and life results from these two things. For though the flames may be the foes\nof water, everything that lives begins in humid vapour, and it seems discordant concord is the means of life.\nWhen Earth, spread over with diluvian ooze, felt heat ethereal from the glowing sun, unnumbered species to\nthe light she gave, and gave to being many an ancient form, or monster new created. Unwilling she created thus\nenormous Python.\u2014Thou unheard of serpent spread so far athwart the side of a vast mountain, didst fill with fear\nthe race of new created man. The God that bears the bow (a weapon used till then only to hunt the deer and agile\ngoat) destroyed the monster with a myriad darts, and almost emptied all his quiver, till envenomed gore oozed\nforth from livid wounds.\nLest in a dark oblivion time should hide the fame of this achievement, sacred sports he instituted, from the Py-\nthon called \u201cThe Pythian Games.\u201d In these the happy youth who proved victorious in the chariot race, running and\nboxing, with an honoured crown of oak leaves was enwreathed. The laurel then was not created, wherefore Phoe-\nbus, bright and godlike, beauteous with his flowing hair, was wont to wreathe his brows with various leaves.\n879 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nDaphne.\nDaphne and Phoebus\nDaphne, the daughter of a River God was first beloved by Phoebus, the great God of glorious light. \u2018Twas not a\ncause of chance but out of Cupid\u2019s vengeful spite that she was fated to torment the lord of light. For Phoebus, proud\nof Python\u2019s death, beheld that impish god of Love upon a time when he was bending his diminished bow, and\nvoicing his contempt in anger said; \u201cWhat, wanton boy, are mighty arms to thee, great weapons suited to the needs\nof war? The bow is only for the use of those large deities of heaven whose strength may deal wounds, mortal, to the\nsavage beasts of prey; and who courageous overcome their foes.\u2014 it is a proper weapon to the use of such as slew\nwith arrows Python, huge, whose pestilential carcase vast extent covered. Content thee with the flames thy torch\nenkindles (fires too subtle for my thought) and leave to me the glory that is mine.\u201d\nTo him, undaunted, Venus, son replied; \u201cO Phoebus, thou canst conquer all the world with thy strong bow\nand arrows, but with this small arrow I shall pierce thy vaunting breast! And by the measure that thy might ex-\nceeds the broken powers of thy defeated foes, so is thy glory less than mine.\u201d No more he said, but with his wings\nexpanded thence flew lightly to Parnassus, lofty peak. There, from his quiver he plucked arrows twain, most curi-\nously wrought of different art; one love exciting, one repelling love. The dart of love was glittering, gold and sharp,\nthe other had a blunted tip of lead; and with that dull lead dart he shot the Nymph, but with the keen point of the\ngolden dart he pierced the bone and marrow of\nthe God.\nImmediately the one with love was filled, the\nother, scouting at the thought of love, rejoiced in\nthe deep shadow of the woods, and as the virgin\nPhoebe (who denies the joys of love and loves the\njoys of chase) a maiden\u2019s fillet bound her flowing\nhair,\u2014 and her pure mind denied the love of man.\nBeloved and wooed she wandered silent paths,\nfor never could her modesty endure the glance of\nman or listen to his love.\nHer grieving father spoke to her, \u201cAlas, my\ndaughter, I have wished a son in law, and now you\nowe a grandchild to the joy of my old age.\u201d But\nDaphne only hung her head to hide her shame.\nThe nuptial torch seemed criminal to her. She\neven clung, caressing, with her arms around his\nneck, and pled, \u201cMy dearest father let me live a\nvirgin always, for remember Jove did grant it to\nDiana at her birth.\u201d\nBut though her father promised her desire,\nher loveliness prevailed against their will; for,\nPhoebus when he saw her waxed distraught, and\nfilled with wonder his sick fancy raised delusive\nhopes, and his own oracles deceived him.\u2014As\nthe stubble in the field flares up, or as the stacked\nwheat is consumed by flames, enkindled from a\nspark or torch the chance pedestrian may neglect\nat dawn; so was the bosom of the god consumed,\nand so desire flamed in his stricken heart.\nHe saw her bright hair waving on her neck;\u2014\n\u201cHow beautiful if properly arranged! \u201d He saw her\neyes like stars of sparkling fire, her lips for kissing\nsweetest, and her hands and fingers and her arms;\nher shoulders white as ivory;\u2014and whatever was\nImage 4.5: Apollo and Daphne | This oil painting by Antonio del not seen more beautiful must be.\nPollaiuolo shows the god Apollo pursuing the naiad Daphne.

Alas, if thou shouldst fall and mar thy face,\nor tear upon the bramble thy soft thighs, or should I prove unwilling cause of pain! \u201cThe wilderness is rough and\ndangerous, and I beseech thee be more careful\u2014I will follow slowly.\u2014Ask of whom thou wilt, and thou shalt learn\nthat I am not a churl\u2014 I am no mountain dweller of rude caves, nor clown compelled to watch the sheep and goats;\nand neither canst thou know from whom thy feet fly fearful, or thou wouldst not leave me thus. \u201cThe Delphic Land,\nthe Pataraean Realm, Claros and Tenedos revere my name, and my immortal sire is Jupiter. The present, past and\nfuture are through me in sacred oracles revealed to man, and from my harp the harmonies of sound are borrowed\nby their bards to praise the Gods. My bow is certain, but a flaming shaft surpassing mine has pierced my heart\u2014\nuntouched before. The art of medicine is my invention, and the power of herbs; but though the world declare my\nuseful works there is no herb to medicate my wound, and all the arts that save have failed their lord.,\u201d\nBut even as he made his plaint, the Nymph with timid footsteps fled from his approach, and left him to his\nmurmurs and his pain.\nLovely the virgin seemed as the soft wind exposed her limbs, and as the zephyrs fond fluttered amid her gar-\nments, and the breeze fanned lightly in her flowing hair. She seemed most lovely to his fancy in her flight; and mad\nwith love he followed in her steps, and silent hastened his increasing speed.\nAs when the greyhound sees the frightened hare flit over the plain:\u2014With eager nose outstretched, impetuous,\nhe rushes on his prey, and gains upon her till he treads her feet, and almost fastens in her side his fangs;\nbut she, whilst dreading that her end is near, is suddenly delivered from her fright; so was it with the god and\nvirgin: one with hope pursued, the other fled in fear; and he who followed, borne on wings of love, permitted her\nno rest and gained on her, until his warm breath mingled in her hair.\nHer strength spent, pale and faint, with pleading eyes she gazed upon her father\u2019s waves and prayed, \u201cHelp me\nmy father, if thy flowing streams have virtue! Cover me, O mother Earth! Destroy the beauty that has injured me, or\nchange the body that destroys my life.\u201d\nBefore her prayer was ended, torpor seized on all her body, and a thin bark closed around her gentle bosom,\nand her hair became as moving leaves; her arms were changed to waving branches, and her active feet as clinging\nroots were fastened to the ground\u2014 her face was hidden with encircling leaves.\u2014\nPhoebus admired and loved the graceful tree, (For still, though changed, her slender form remained) and with\nhis right hand lingering on the trunk he felt her bosom throbbing in the bark. He clung to trunk and branch as\nthough to twine. His form with hers, and fondly kissed the wood that shrank from every kiss.\nAnd thus the God; \u201cAlthough thou canst not be my bride, thou shalt be called my chosen tree, and thy green\nleaves, O Laurel! shall forever crown my brows, be wreathed around my quiver and my lyre; the Roman heroes shall\nbe crowned with thee, as long processions climb the Capitol and chanting throngs proclaim their victories; and as\na faithful warden thou shalt guard the civic crown of oak leaves fixed between thy branches, and before Augustan\ngates. And as my youthful head is never shorn, so, also, shalt thou ever bear thy leaves unchanging to thy glory.,\u201d\nHere the God, Phoebus Apollo, ended his lament, and unto him the Laurel bent her boughs, so lately fashioned;\nand it seemed to him her graceful nod gave answer to his love.\nIo. Argus. Syrinx.\nIo and Jupiter\nThere is a grove in Thessaly, enclosed on every side with crags, precipitous,\u2014 on which a forest grows\u2014and this\nis called the Vale of Tempe\u2014through this valley flows the River Peneus, white with foaming waves, that issue from\nthe foot of Pindus, whence with sudden fall up gather steamy clouds that sprinkle mist upon the circling trees, and\nfar away with mighty roar resound. It is the abode, the solitary home, that mighty River loves, where deep in gloom\nof rocky cavern, he resides and rules the flowing waters and the water nymphs abiding there. All rivers of that land\nnow hasten thither, doubtful to console or flatter Daphne\u2019s parent: poplar crowned Sperchios, swift Enipeus and the\nwild Amphrysos, old Apidanus and Aeas, with all their kindred streams that wandering maze and wearied seek the\nocean. Inachus alone is absent, hidden in his cave obscure, deepening his waters with his tears\u2014 most wretchedly\nbewailing, for he deems his daughter Io lost. If she may live or roam a spirit in the nether shades he dares not even\nguess but dreads\nfor Jove not long before had seen her while returning from her father\u2019s stream, and said; \u201cO virgin, worthy of\nimmortal Jove, although some happy mortal\u2019s chosen bride,\u2014 behold these shades of overhanging trees, and seek\ntheir cool recesses while the sun is glowing in the height of middle skies\u2014\u201d and as he spoke he pointed out the\ngroves\u2014 \u201cBut should the dens of wild beasts frighten you, with safety you may enter the deep woods, conducted\nby a God\u2014not with a God of small repute, but in the care of him who holds the heavenly scepter in his hand and\nfulminates the trackless thunder bolts.\u2014 forsake me not! \u201d For while he spoke she fled, and swiftly left behind the\n881 Compact Anthology of World Literature\npasture fields of Lerna, and Lyrcea\u2019s arbours, where the trees are planted thickly. But the God called forth a heavy\nshadow which involved the wide extended earth, and stopped her flight and ravished in that cloud her chastity.\nMeanwhile, the goddess Juno gazing down on earth\u2019s expanse, with wonder saw the clouds as dark as night\nenfold those middle fields while day was bright above. She was convinced the clouds were none composed of river\nmist nor raised from marshy fens. Suspicious now, from oft detected amours of her spouse, she glanced around to\nfind her absent lord, and quite convinced that he was far from heaven, she thus exclaimed; \u201cThis cloud deceives my\nmind, or Jove has wronged me.\u201d From the dome of heaven she glided down and stood upon the earth, and bade the\nclouds recede. But Jove had known the coming of his queen. He had transformed the lovely Io, so that she appeared\na milk white heifer\u2014formed so beautiful and fair that envious Juno gazed on her. She queried: \u201cWhose? what herd?\nwhat pasture fields?\u201d As if she guessed no knowledge of the truth. And Jupiter, false hearted, said the cow was earth\nbegotten, for he feared his queen might make inquiry of the owner\u2019s name. Juno implored the heifer as a gift.\u2014\nwhat then was left the Father of the Gods? \u2018Twould be a cruel thing to sacrifice his own beloved to a rival\u2019s wrath.\nAlthough refusal must imply his guilt the shame and love of her almost prevailed; but if a present of such little\nworth were now denied the sharer of his couch, the partner of his birth, \u2018twould prove indeed the earth born heifer\nother than she seemed\u2014 and so he gave his mistress up to her.\nJuno regardful of Jove\u2019s cunning art, lest he might change her to her human form, gave the unhappy heifer to\nthe charge of Argus, Aristorides, whose head was circled with a hundred glowing eyes; of which but two did slum-\nber in their turn whilst all the others kept on watch and guard.\nWhichever way he stood his gaze was fixed on Io\u2014even if he turned away his watchful eyes on Io still re-\nmained. He let her feed by day; but when the sun was under the deep world he shut her up, and tied a rope around\nher tender neck.\nShe fed upon green leaves and bitter herbs and on the cold ground slept\u2014too often bare, she could not rest\nupon a cushioned couch. She drank the troubled waters. Hoping aid she tried to stretch imploring arms to Argus,\nbut all in vain for now no arms remained; the sound of bellowing was all she heard, and she was frightened with her\nproper voice.\nWhere former days she loved to roam and sport, she wandered by the banks of Inachus: there imaged in the\nstream she saw her horns and, startled, turned and fled. And Inachus and all her sister Naiads knew her not, al-\nthough she followed them, they knew her not, although she suffered them to touch her sides and praise her.\nWhen the ancient Inachus gathered sweet herbs and offered them to her, she licked his hands, kissing her\nfather\u2019s palms, nor could she more restrain her falling tears. If only words as well as tears would flow, she might\nimplore his aid and tell her name and all her sad misfortune; but, instead, she traced in dust the letters of her name\nwith cloven hoof; and thus her sad estate was known. \u201cAh wretched me! \u201d her father cried; and as he clung around\nher horns and neck repeated while she groaned, \u201cAh wretched me! Art thou my daughter sought in every clime?\nWhen lost I could not grieve for thee as now that thou art found; thy sighs instead of words heave up from thy deep\nbreast, thy longings give me answer. I prepared the nuptial torch and bridal chamber, in my ignorance, since my\nfirst hope was for a son in law; and then I dreamed of children from the match: but now the herd may furnish thee\na mate, and all thy issue of the herd must be. Oh that a righteous death would end my grief!\u2014 it is a dreadful thing\nto be a God! Behold the lethal gate of death is shut against me, and my growing grief must last throughout eternity.\u201d\nWhile thus he moaned came starry Argus there, and Io bore from her lamenting father. Thence he led his\ncharge to other pastures; and removed from her, upon a lofty mountain sat, whence he could always watch her,\nundisturbed.\nThe sovereign god no longer could endure to witness Io\u2019s woes. He called his son, whom Maia brightest of the\nPleiades brought forth, and bade him slay the star eyed guard, argus. He seized his sleep compelling wand and\nfastened waving wings on his swift feet, and deftly fixed his brimmed hat on his head:\u2014 lo, Mercury, the favoured\nson of Jove, descending to the earth from heaven\u2019s plains, put off his cap and wings,\u2014 though still retained his wand\nwith which he drove through pathless wilds some stray she goats, and as a shepherd fared, piping on oaten reeds\nmelodious tunes.\nArgus, delighted with the charming sound of this new art began; \u201cWhoever thou art, sit with me on this stone\nbeneath the trees in cooling shade, whilst browse the tended flock abundant herbs; for thou canst see the shade is\nfit for shepherds.\u201d Wherefore, Mercury sat down beside the keeper and conversed of various things\u2014passing the\nlaggard hours.\u2014\nthen soothly piped he on the joined reeds to lull those ever watchful eyes asleep; but Argus strove his languor to\nsubdue, and though some drowsy eyes might slumber, still were some that vigil kept. Again he spoke, (for the pipes\nwere yet a recent art) \u201cI pray thee tell what chance discovered these.\u201d\nTo him the God, \u201c A famous Naiad dwelt among the Hamadryads, on the cold Arcadian summit Nonacris,\nwhose name was Syrinx. Often she escaped the Gods, that wandered in the groves of sylvan shades, and often fled\nfrom Satyrs that pursued. Vowing virginity, in all pursuits she strove to emulate Diana\u2019s ways: and as that graceful\n882 Metamorphoses\ngoddess wears her robe, so Syrinx girded hers that one might well believe Diana there. Even though her bow were\nmade of horn, Diana\u2019s wrought of gold, vet might she well deceive. \u201cNow chanced it Pan. Whose head was girt\nwith prickly pines, espied the Nymph returning from the Lycian Hill, and these words uttered he: \u201d\u2014But Mercury\nrefrained from further speech, and Pan\u2019s appeal remains untold. If he had told it all, the tale of Syrinx would have\nfollowed thus:\u2014\nbut she despised the prayers of Pan, and fled through pathless wilds until she had arrived the placid Ladon\u2019s\nsandy stream, whose waves prevented her escape. There she implored her sister Nymphs to change her form: and\nPan, believing he had caught her, held instead some marsh reeds for the body of the Nymph; and while he sighed\nthe moving winds began to utter plaintive music in the reeds, so sweet and voice like that poor Pan exclaimed; \u201cFor-\never this discovery shall remain a sweet communion binding thee to me.\u201d\u2014 and this explains why reeds of different\nlength, when joined together by cementing wax, derive the name of Syrinx from the maid.\nSuch words the bright god Mercury would say; but now perceiving Argus\u2019 eyes were dimmed in languor-\nous doze, he hushed his voice and touched the drooping eyelids with his magic wand, compelling slumber. Then\nwithout delay he struck the sleeper with his crescent sword, where neck and head unite, and hurled his head, blood\ndripping, down the rocks and rugged cliff.\nLow lies Argus: dark is the light of all his hundred eyes, his many orbed lights extinguished in the universal\ngloom that night surrounds; but Saturn\u2019s daughter spread their glister on the feathers of her bird, emblazoning its\ntail with starry gems.\nJuno made haste, inflamed with towering rage, to vent her wrath on Io; and she raised in thought and vision of\nthe Grecian girl a dreadful Fury. Stings invisible, and pitiless, she planted in her breast, and drove her wandering\nthroughout the globe.\nThe utmost limit of her laboured way, O Nile, thou didst remain. Which, having reached, and placed her tired\nknees on that river\u2019s edge, she laid her there, and as she raised her neck looked upward to the stars, and groaned and\nwept and mournfully bellowed: trying thus to plead, by all the means she had, that Jupiter might end her miseries.\nRepentant Jove embraced his consort, and entreated her to end the punishment: \u201cFear not,\u201d he said, \u201cFor she shall\ntrouble thee no more.\u201d He spoke, and called on bitter Styx to hear his oath.\nAnd now imperial Juno, pacified, permitted Io to resume her form,\u2014 at once the hair fell from her snowy sides;\nthe horns absorbed, her dilate orbs decreased; the opening of her jaws contracted; hands appeared and shoulders;\nand each transformed hoof became five nails. And every mark or form that gave the semblance of a heifer changed,\nexcept her fair white skin; and the glad Nymph was raised erect and stood upon her feet. But long the very thought\nof speech, that she might bellow as a heifer, filled her mind with terror, till the words so long forgot for some suffi-\ncient cause were tried once more.\nPhaethon.\nand since that time, the linen wearing throng of Egypt have adored her as a God; for they believe the seed of\nJove prevailed; and when her time was due she bore to him a son called Epaphus; who also dwells in temples with\nhis mother in that land.\nNow Phaethon, whose father was the Sun, was equal to his rival, Epaphus, in mind and years; and he was glad\nto boast of wonders, nor would yield to Epaphus for pride of Phoebus, his reputed sire. Unable to endure it, Io\u2019s son\nthus mocked him; \u201cPoor, demented fellow, what will you not credit if your mother speaks, you are so puffed up with\nthe fond conceit of your imagined sire, the Lord of Day.\u201d\nshame crimsoned in his cheeks, but Phaethon withholding rage, reported all the taunts of Epaphus to Cly-\nmene his mother: \u201c\u2018Twill grieve you, mother, I, the bold and free, was silent; and it shames me to report this dark\nreproach remains unchallenged. Oh, if I am born of race divine, give proof of that illustrious descent and claim my\nright to Heaven.\u201d Around his mother\u2019s neck he drew his arms, and by the head of Merops, and by his own, and by\nthe nuptial torch of his beloved sisters, he implored for some true token of his origin.\nOr moved by Phaethon\u2019s importuned words, or by the grievous charge, who might declare? She raised her arms\nto Heaven, and gazing full upon the broad sun said; \u201cI swear to you by yonder orb, so radiant and bright, which\nboth beholds and hears us while we speak, that you are his begotten son.\u2014You are the child of that great light\nwhich sways the world: and if I have not spoken what is true, let not mine eyes behold his countenance, and let this\nfatal moment be the last that I shall look upon the light of day! Nor will it weary you, my son, to reach your father\u2019s\ndwelling; for the very place where he appears at dawn is near our land. Go, if it please you, and the very truth learn\nfrom your father.\u201d Instantly sprang forth exultant Phaethon. Overjoyed with words so welcome, he imagined he\ncould leap and touch the skies. And so he passed his land of Ethiopia, and the Indies, hot beneath the tawny sun,\nand there he turned his footsteps to his father\u2019s Land of Dawn.\n883 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nBook 2\nSection 7\nEuropa.\nSo from the land of Pallas went the God, his great revenge accomplished on the head of impious Aglauros; and\nhe soared on waving wings into the opened skies: and there his father called him to his side, and said,\u2014with words\nto hide his passion;\u2014Son,\u2014 thou faithful minister of my commands.\u2014 let naught delay thee\u2014swiftly take the way,\naccustomed, to the land of Sidon (which adores thy mother\u2019s star upon the left) when there, drive over to the sound-\ning shore that royal herd, which far away is fed on mountain grass. He spoke, and instantly the herd was driven from\nthe mountain side; then headed for the shore, as Jove desired,\u2014to where the great king\u2019s daughter often went in play,\nattended by the maids of Tyre. Can love abide the majesty of kings? Love cannot always dwell upon a throne.\nEuropa and Jupiter: The House of Cadmus\nJove laid aside his glorious dignity, for he assumed the semblance of a bull and mingled with the bullocks in the\ngroves, his colour white as virgin snow, untrod, unmelted by the watery Southern Wind.\nHis neck was thick with muscles, dewlaps hung between his shoulders; and his polished horns, so small and\nbeautifully set, appeared the artifice of man; fashioned as fair and more transparent than a lucent gem. His forehead\nwas not lowered for attack, nor was there fury in his open eyes; the love of peace was in his countenance.\nWhen she beheld his beauty and mild eyes, the daughter of Agenor was amazed; but, daring not to touch him,\nstood apart until her virgin fears were quieted; then, near him, fragrant flowers in her hand she offered,\u2014tempting,\nto his gentle mouth: and then the loving god in his great joy kissed her sweet hands, and could not wait her will.\nJove then began to frisk upon the grass, or laid his snow-white side on the smooth sand, yellow and golden. As\nher courage grew he gave his breast one moment for caress, or bent his head for garlands newly made, wreathed for\nhis polished horns.\nThe royal maid, unwitting what she did, at length sat down upon the bull\u2019s broad back. Then by degrees the\ngod moved from the land and from the shore, and placed his feet, that seemed but shining hoofs, in shallow wa-\nter by the sandy merge; and not a moment resting bore her thence, across the surface of the Middle Sea, while she\naffrighted gazed upon the shore\u2014so fast receding. And she held his horn with her right hand, and, steadied by the\nleft, held on his ample back\u2014and in the breeze her waving garments fluttered as they went.\nBook 4\nSection 2\nPyramus et Thisbe.\nPyramus and Thisbe\nWhen Pyramus and Thisbe, who were known the one most handsome of all youthful men, the other loveliest of all\neastern girls,\u2014 lived in adjoining houses, near the walls that Queen Semiramis had built of brick around her famous\ncity, they grew fond, and loved each other\u2014meeting often there\u2014 and as the days went by their love increased.\nThey wished to join in marriage, but that joy their fathers had forbidden them to hope; and yet the passion that with\nequal strength inflamed their minds no parents could forbid. No relatives had guessed their secret love, for all their con-\nverse was by nods and signs; and as a smoldering fire may gather heat, the more \u2018tis smothered, so their love increased.\nNow, it so happened, a partition built between their houses, many years ago, was made defective with a little\nchink; a small defect observed by none, although for ages there; but what is hid from love? Our lovers found the\nsecret opening, and used its passage to convey the sounds of gentle, murmured words, whose tuneful note passed\noft in safety through that hidden way.\nThere, many a time, they stood on either side, thisbe on one and Pyramus the other, and when their warm\nbreath touched from lip to lip, their sighs were such as this: \u201cThou envious wall why art thou standing in the way of\nthose who die for love? What harm could happen thee shouldst thou permit us to enjoy our love? But if we ask too\nmuch, let us persuade that thou wilt open while we kiss but once: for, we are not ungrateful; unto thee we own our\ndebt; here thou hast left a way that breathed words may enter loving ears.,\u201d so vainly whispered they, and when the\nnight began to darken they exchanged farewells; made presence that they kissed a fond farewell vain kisses that to\nlove might none avail.\nWhen dawn removed the glimmering lamps of night, and the bright sun had dried the dewy grass again they met\nwhere they had told their love; and now complaining of their hapless fate, in murmurs gentle, they at last resolved,\naway to slip upon the quiet night, elude their parents, and, as soon as free, quit the great builded city and their homes.\n884 Metamorphoses\nFearful to wander in the pathless fields, they chose a trysting place, the tomb of Ninus, where safely they might\nhide unseen, beneath the shadow of a tall mulberry tree, covered with snow-white fruit, close by a spring.\nAll is arranged according to their hopes: and now the daylight, seeming slowly moved, sinks in the deep waves,\nand the tardy night arises from the spot where day declines.\nQuickly, the clever Thisbe having first deceived her parents, opened the closed door. She flitted in the silent\nnight away; and, having veiled her face, reached the great tomb, and sat beneath the tree; love made her bold.\nThere, as she waited, a great lioness approached the nearby spring to quench her thirst: her frothing jaws\nincarnadined with blood of slaughtered oxen. As the moon was bright, Thisbe could see her, and affrighted fled\nwith trembling footstep to a gloomy cave; and as she ran she slipped and dropped her veil, which fluttered to the\nground. She did not dare to save it. Wherefore, when the savage beast had taken a great draft and slaked her thirst,\nand thence had turned to seek her forest lair, she found it on her way, and full of rage, tore it and stained it with her\nbloody jaws: but Thisbe, fortunate, escaped unseen.\nNow Pyramus had not gone out so soon as Thisbe to the tryst; and, when he saw the certain traces of that\nsavage beast, imprinted in the yielding dust, his face went white with fear; but when he found the veil covered with\nblood, he cried; \u201cAlas, one night has caused the ruin of two lovers! Thou wert most deserving of completed days,\nbut as for me, my heart is guilty! I destroyed thee! O my love! I bade thee come out in the dark night to a lonely\nhaunt, and failed to go before. Oh! whatever lurks beneath this rock, though ravenous lion, tear my guilty flesh, and\nwith most cruel jaws devour my cursed entrails! What? Not so; it is a craven\u2019s part to wish for death!\u201d\nSo he stopped briefly; and took up the veil; went straightway to the shadow of the tree; and as his tears bedewed\nthe well-known veil, he kissed it oft and sighing said, \u201cKisses and tears are thine, receive my blood as well.\u201d\nAnd he imbrued the steel, girt at his side, deep in his bowels; and plucked it from the wound, a-faint with death.\nAs he fell back to earth, his spurting blood shot upward in the air; so, when decay has rift a leaden pipe a hissing jet\nof water spurts on high.\u2014\nBy that dark tide the berries on the tree assumed a deeper tint, for as the roots soaked up the blood the pendent\nmulberries were dyed a purple tint.\nThisbe returned, though trembling still with fright, for now she thought her lover must await her at the tree,\nand she should haste before he feared for her. Longing to tell him of her great escape she sadly looked for him with\nfaithful eyes; but when she saw the spot and the changed tree, she doubted could they be the same, for so the colour\nof the hanging fruit deceived.\nWhile doubt dismayed her, on the ground she saw the wounded body covered with its blood;\u2014 she started\nbackward, and her face grew pale and ashen; and she shuddered like the sea, which trembles when its face is lightly\nskimmed by the chill breezes;\u2014and she paused a space;\u2014 but when she knew it was the one she loved, she struck\nher tender breast and tore her hair. Then wreathing in her arms his loved form, she bathed the wound with tears,\nmingling her grief in his unquenched blood; and as she kissed his death-cold features wailed; \u201cAh Pyramus, what\ncruel fate has taken thy life away? Pyramus! Pyramus! awake! awake! It is thy dearest Thisbe calls thee! Lift thy\ndrooping head! Alas,\u201d\u2014At Thisbe\u2019s name he raised his eyes, though languorous in death, and darkness gathered\nround him as he gazed.\nAnd then she saw her veil; and near it lay his ivory sheath\u2014but not the trusty sword and once again she wailed;\n\u201cThy own right hand, and thy great passion have destroyed thee!\u2014 And I? my hand shall be as bold as thine\u2014 my\nlove shall nerve me to the fatal deed\u2014 thee, I will follow to eternity\u2014 though I be censured for the wretched cause,\nso surely I shall share thy wretched fate:\u2014 alas, whom death could me alone bereave, thou shalt not from my love\nbe reft by death! And, O ye wretched parents, mine and his, let our misfortunes and our pleadings melt your hearts,\nthat ye no more deny to those whom constant love and lasting death unite\u2014 entomb us in a single sepulchre.\n\u201cAnd, O thou tree of many-branching boughs, spreading dark shadows on the corpse of one, destined to cover\ntwain, take thou our fate upon thy head; mourn our untimely deaths; let thy fruit darken for a memory, an emblem\nof our blood.\u201d No more she said; and having fixed the point below her breast, she fell on the keen sword, still warm\nwith his red blood.\nBut though her death was out of Nature\u2019s law her prayer was answered, for it moved the Gods and moved their\nparents. Now the Gods have changed the ripened fruit which darkens on the branch: and from the funeral pile their\nparents sealed their gathered ashes in a single urn.\nBook 7\nSection 1\nIason et Medea.\nJason and Medea\n885 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nOver the storm-tossed waves, the Argonauts had sailed in Argo, their long ship to where King Phineus, needy\nin his old age, reigned\u2014 deprived of sight and feeble. When the sons of Boreas had landed on the shore, and seen\nthe Harpies snatching from the king his nourishment, befouling it with beaks obscene, they drove those hu-\nman-vultures thence.\nAnd having suffered hardships and great toils, after the day they rescued the sad king from the vile Harpies,\nthose twin valiant youths, Zetes and Calais came with their chief, the mighty Jason, where the Phasis flows.\nFrom the green margin of that river, all the crew of Argonauts, by Jason led, went to the king Aeetes and\nrequired the Golden Fleece, that he received from Phryxus. When they had bargained with him, full of wiles he of-\nfered to restore the Golden Fleece only to those who might to him return, victorious from hard labors of great risk.\nMedea, the king\u2019s daughter, near his throne, saw Jason, leader of the Argonauts, as he was pressing to secure a\nprize\u2014 and loved at sight with a consuming flame.\nAlthough she struggled to suppress her love, unable to restrain herself, she said, \u201cIn vain I\u2019ve striven to subdue\nmy heart: some god it must be, which I cannot tell, is working to destroy my hapless life; or else it is the burning\nflame of love that in me rages. If it is not love, why do the mandates of my father seem too harsh? They surely are\ntoo harsh. Why do I fear that he may perish whom I have seen only once? What is the secret cause that I am agitat-\ned by such fears?\u2014 It is no other than the god of Love.\n\u201cThrust from your virgin breast such burning flames and overcome their hot unhappiness\u2014 if I could do so, I\nshould be myself: but some deluding power is holding me helpless against my will. Desire persuades me one way,\nbut my reason still persuades another way. I see a better course and I approve, but follow its defeat. \u2014\n\u201cO royal maiden, why are you consumed with love for this strange man, and why are you so willing to be car-\nried by the nuptial ties so far from your own country, where, indeed, are many brave men worthy of your love?\n\u201cWhether for life or death his numbered hours are in the mercy of the living Gods, and that he may not suffer\nrisk of death, too well foreseen, now let my prayers prevail\u2014 righteously uttered of a generous heart without the\nstress of love. What wicked thing has Jason done? His handsome person, youth, and noble ways, would move a\nheart of stone.\n\u201cHave I a heart of flint, or was I born a tigress to deny him timely aid?\u2014 Unless I interpose, he will be slain by\nthe hot breath of brazen-footed bulls, or will be slaughtered by the warriors, sprung miraculous from earth, or will\nbe given to satisfy the ravenous appetite of a huge dragon.\n\u201cLet my gloating eyes be satiate with his dying agonies! Let me incite the fury of these bulls! Stir to their blood-\nlust mad-born sons of Earth! Rouse up the never-sleeping dragon\u2019s rage!\u2014 \u201cAvert it Gods!\u2014\n\u201cBut why should I cry out upon the Gods to save him from such wrong, when, by my actions and my power,\nmyself may shield him from all evils?\n\u201cSuch a course would wreck the kingdom of my father\u2014and by me the wily stranger would escape from him;\nand spreading to the wind his ready sails he would forget and leave me to my fate.\u2014 Oh, if he should forget my\nsacrifice, and so prefer those who neglected him, let him then perish in his treachery.\u2014\n\u201cBut these are idle thoughts: his countenance, reveals innate nobility and grace, that should dispel all fear of\ntreachery, and guarantee his ever-faithful heart. The Gods will witness our united souls, and he shall pledge his\nfaith. Secure of it my fear will be removed. Be ready, then\u2014 and make a virtue of necessity: your Jason owes himself\nto you; and he must join you in true wedlock. Then you shall be celebrated through the land of Greece, by throngs\nof women, for the man you saved.\n\u201cShall I then sail away, and so forsake my sister, brother, father, Gods, and land that gave me birth? My father\nis indeed a stern man, and my native land is all too barbarous; my brother is a child,\u2014 my sister\u2019s goodwill is good\nhelp for me; and heaven\u2019s supreme god is within my breast.\n\u201cI shall not so be leaving valued hopes, but will be going surely to great things. And I should gain applause from\nall the world, as having saved the threatened Argonauts, most noble of the Greeks; and in their land, which certain-\nly is better than my own, become the bride of Jason, for whose love I should not hesitate to give the world\u2014 and in\nwhose love the living Gods rejoice so greatly; for his sake they would bestow their favors on my head, and make the\nstars my habitation.\n\u201cShould I hesitate because the wreck-strewn mountains bar the way, and clash together in the Euxine waves; or\nfear Charybdis, fatal to large ships, that sucks the deep sea in its whirling gulf and spouts far upward, with alternate\nforce, or Scylla, circled with infuriate hounds howling in rage from deep Sicilian waves?\n\u201cSafe in the shielding arms of him I love, on Jason\u2019s bosom leaning, I shall be borne safely over wide and hostile\nseas; and in his dear embrace forget my fears\u2014 or if for anything I suffer dread, it will be only for the one I love.\u2014\n\u201cAlas, Medea, this vain argument has only furnished plausible excuse for criminal desires, and desecrates the\nmarriage rite. It is a wicked thing to think upon. Before it is too late forget your passion and deny this guilt.\u201d\nAnd after she had said these words, her eyes were opened to the prize of modesty, chaste virtue, and a pure\naffection: and Cupid, vanquished, turned away and fled.\n886 Metamorphoses\nThen, to an ancient altar of the goddess named Hecate, Perse\u2019s daughter took her way in the deep shadows of a\nforest. She was strong of purpose now, and all the flames of vanquished passion had died down; but when she saw\nthe son of Aeson, dying flames leaped up again. Her cheeks grew red, then all her face went pale again; as a small\nspark when hid beneath the ashes, if fed by a breath of wind grows and regains its strength, as it is fanned to life;\nso now her love that had been smoldering, and which you would have thought was almost dead, when she had see\nagain his manly youth, blazed up once more.\nFor on that day his graceful person seemed as glorious as a God;\u2014and as she gazed, and fixed her eyes upon\nhis countenance, her frenzy so prevailed, she was convinced that he was not a mortal. And her eyes were fascinated;\nand she could not turn away from him. But when he spoke to her, and promised marriage, grasping her right hand:\nshe answered, as her eyes suffused with tears; \u201cI see what I will do, and ignorance of truth will not be my undoing\nnow, but love itself. By my assistance you shall be preserved; but when preserved fulfill your promise.\u201d\nHe swore that she could trust in him. Then by the goddess of the triple form, Diana, Trivia, or Luna called, and\nby her sacred groves and fanes, he vowed, and by the hallowed Sun that sees all things, and by his own adventures,\nand his life,\u2014 on these the youthful Jason took his oath.\u2014 With this she was assured and quickly gave to him the\nmagic herbs: he learnt their use and full of joy withdrew into his house.\nNow when the dawn had dimmed the glittering stars, the people hastened to the sacred field of Mars, and on\nthe hills expectant stood.\u2014 Arrayed in purple, and in majesty distinguished by his ivory sceptre, sat the king, sur-\nrounded by a multitude. Below them on the visioned Field of Mars, huge brazen-footed bulls were breathing forth\nfrom adamantine nostrils living flames, blasting the verdant herbage in their path!\nAs forges glowing with hot flames resound, or as much quick-lime, burnt in earthen kilns, crackles and hisses\nas if mad with rage, sprinkled with water, liberating heat; so their hot throats and triple-heated sides, resounding\ntold of pent-up fires within.\nThe son of Aeson went to meet them. As he came to meet them the fierce animals turned on him faces terrible,\nand sharp horns tipped with iron, and they pawed the dusty earth with cloven feet, and filled the place with fiery\nbellowings. The Minyans were stark with fear; he went up to the bulls not feeling their hot breath at all, so great the\npower of his charmed drugs; and while he was stroking their down-hanging dewlaps with a fearless hand, he placed\nthe yoke down on their necks and made them draw the heavy plow, and cut through fields that never felt the steel\nbefore. The Colchians were amazed and silent; but the loud shouting of the Minyans increased their hero\u2019s courage.\nTaking then the serpent\u2019s teeth out of a brazen helmet he sowed them broadcast in the new-plowed field.\nThe moist earth softened these seeds that were steeped in virulent poison and the teeth swelled up and took\nnew forms. And just as in its mother an infant gradually assumes the form of man, and is perfected through all\nparts within, and does not come forth to the light till fully formed; so, when the forms of men had been completed\nin the womb of earth made pregnant, they rose up from it, and what is yet more wonderful, each one clashed weap-\nons that had been brought forth with him.\nWhen his companions saw the warriors turn as if with one accord, to hurl their spears, sharp-pointed, at the\nhead of Jason, fear unnerved the boldest and their courage failed. So, too, the maid whose sorcery had saved him\nfrom much danger, when she saw the youth encompassed by those raging enemies, and he alone against so many\u2014\nstruck with sudden panic, she turned ashen white, her bloodless cheeks were blanched; and chilled with fear she\nwilted to the ground; and lest the herbs, so lately given him, might fail his need she added incantations and invoked\nmysterious arts. While she protected him\nHe seized upon a heavy stone, and hurled it in the midst of his new enemies\u2014 distracted by this cast, and mur-\nderous, they turned from him, and clashing their new arms, those earth-born brothers fought among themselves till\nall were slaughtered in blood-thirsty strife.\nGladly the Greeks acclaimed him conqueror, and pressed around him for the first embrace. Then, too, Medea,\nbarbarous Colchian maid, although her modesty restrained her heart, eagerly longed to fold him in her arms, but\ncareful of her good name, held aloof,\u2014 rejoicing in deep, silent love; and she acknowledged to the Gods her mighty\ngift of incantations.\nBut the dragon, still alert,\u2014magnificent and terrible with gorgeous crest and triple tongue, and fangs barbed\nas a javelin, guards the Golden Fleece: and Jason can obtain that quest only if slumber may seal up the monster\u2019s\neyes.\u2014\nJason, successful, sprinkled on his crest Lethean juices of a magic herb, and then recited thrice the words which\nbring deep slumber, potent words which would becalm the storm-tossed ocean, and would stop the flow of the\nmost rapid rivers of our earth: and slowly slumber sealed the dragon\u2019s eyes.\nWhile that great monster slept, the hero took the Golden Fleece; and proudly sailed away bearing his treasure\nand the willing maid, (whose aid had saved him) to his native port Iolcus\u2014victorious with the Argonauts.\n887 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSection 2\nAeson.\nRejuvenation of Aeson\nNow when the valiant Argonauts returned to Thessaly, their happy relatives, fathers and mothers, praised the\nliving Gods; and with their hallowed gifts enhanced the flames with precious incense; and they offered Jove a sacred\nbullock, rich with gilded horns.\nBut Jason\u2019s father, Aeson, came not down rejoicing to behold his son, for now worn out with many years, he\nwaited death. And Jason to Medea grieving said:\n\u201cDearest, to whom my life and love are due, although your kindness has been great to me, and you have granted\nmore than I should ask, yet one thing more I beg of you; if your enchantments can accomplish my desire, take from\nmy life some years that I should live and add them to my father\u2019s ending days.\u201d\u2014 And as he spoke he could not\ncheck his tears.\nMedea, moved by his affection, thought how much less she had grieved for her loved sire: and she replied:\u2014\u201cA\nwicked thing you ask! Can I be capable of using you in such a manner as to take your life and give it to another? Ask\nnot me a thing so dreadful! May the Gods forbid!\u2014 I will endeavor to perform for you a task much greater. By the\npowers of Night I will most certainly return to him the lost years of your father, but must not deprive you of your\nown. \u2014 Oh grant the power, great goddess of the triple form, that I may fail not to accomplish this great deed!\u201d\nThree nights were wanting for the moon to join her circling horns and form a perfect orb. When these were\npassed, the rounded light shone full and bright upon the earth.\u2014Through the still night alone, Medea stole forth\nfrom the house with feet bare, and in flowing garment clothed\u2014 her long hair unadorned and not confined. Deep\nslumber has relaxed the world, and all that\u2019s living, animals and birds and men, and even the hedges and the breath-\ning leaves are still\u2014and motionless the laden air.\nOnly the stars are twinkling, and to them she looks and beckons with imploring hands. Now thrice around she\npaces, and three times besprinkles her long hair with water dipt from crystal streams, which having done she kneels\na moment on the cold, bare ground, and screaming three times calls upon the Night,\u2014\n\u201cO faithful Night, regard my mysteries! O golden-lighted Stars! O softly-moving Moon\u2014 genial, your fire\nsucceeds the heated day! O Hecate! grave three-faced queen of these charms of enchanters and enchanters, arts! O\nfruitful Earth, giver of potent herbs! O gentle Breezes and destructive Winds! You Mountains, Rivers, Lakes and\nsacred Groves, and every dreaded god of silent Night! Attend upon me!\u2014\n\u201cWhen my power commands, the rivers turn from their accustomed ways and roll far backward to their secret\nsprings! I speak\u2014and the wild, troubled sea is calm, and I command the waters to arise! The clouds I scatter\u2014and I\nbring the clouds; I smooth the winds and ruffle up their rage; I weave my spells and I recite my charms; I pluck the\nfangs of serpents, and I move the living rocks and twist the rooted oaks; I blast the forests. Mountains at my word\ntremble and quake; and from her granite tombs the liberated ghosts arise as Earth astonished groans! From your\nappointed ways, O wonder-working Moon, I draw you down against the magic-making sound of gongs and brazen\nvessels of Temesa\u2019s ore; I cast my spells and veil the jeweled rays of Phoebus\u2019 wain, and quench Aurora\u2019s fires.\n\u201cAt my command you tamed the flaming bulls which long disdained to bend beneath the yoke, until they pressed\ntheir necks against the plows; and, subject to my will, you raised up war till the strong company of dragon-birth were\nslaughtered as they fought amongst themselves; and, last, you lulled asleep the warden\u2019s eyes\u2014 guards of the Golden\nFleece\u2014till then awake and sleeping never\u2014so, deceiving him, you sent the treasure to the Grecian cities!\n\u201cWitness my need of super-natured herbs, elixirs potent to renew the years of age, giving the bloom of youth.\u2014\nYou shall not fail to grant me this; for not in vain the stars are flashing confirmation; not in vain the flying dragons,\nharnessed by their necks, from skies descending bring my chariot down.\u201d\nA chariot, sent from heaven, came to her\u2014 and soon as she had stroked the dragons\u2019 necks, and shaken in her\nhands the guiding reins\u2014 as soon as she had mounted, she was borne quickly above, through unresisting air. And,\nsailing over Thessaly, she saw the vale of Tempe, where the level soil is widely covered with a crumbling chalk\u2014 she\nturned her dragons towards new regions there: and she observed the herbs by Ossa born, the weeds on lofty Pelion,\nOthrys, Pindus and vast Olympus\u2014and from here she plucked the needed roots, or there, the blossoms clipped all\nwith a moon-curved sickle made of brass\u2014 many the wild weeds by Apidanus, as well as blue Amphrysus\u2019 banks,\nshe chose, and not escaped Enipeus from her search; Peneian stretches and Spercheian banks all yielded what she\nchose:\u2014and Boebe\u2019s shore where sway the rushes; and she plucked up grass, a secret grass, from fair Euboean fields\nlife-giving virtues in their waving blades, as yet unknown for transformation wrought on Glaucus.\nAll those fields she visited, with ceaseless diligence in quest of charms, nine days and nine nights sought strong\nherbs, and the swift dragons with their active wings, failed not to guide the chariot where she willed\u2014 until they\nreached her home. The dragons then had not been even touched by anything, except the odor of surrounding herbs,\nand yet they sloughed their skins, the growth of years.\n888 Metamorphoses\nShe would not cross the threshold of her home nor pass its gates; but, standing in the field, alone beneath the\ncanopy of Heaven, she shunned all contact with her husband, while she built up from the ever-living turf two altars,\none of which upon the right to Hecate was given, but the one upon the left was sacred then to you, O Hebe, goddess\nof eternal youth!\nFestooning woodland boughs and sweet vervain adorned these altars, near by which she dug as many trenches.\nThen, when all was done, she slaughtered a black ram, and sprinkled with blood the thirsty trenches; after which\nshe poured from rich carchesian goblets generous wine and warm milk, grateful to propitious Gods\u2014 the Deities\nof earth on whom she called\u2014 entreating, as she did so, Pluto, lord of ghostly shades, and ravished Proserpine, that\nthey should not, in undue haste, deprive her patient\u2019s aged limbs of life.\nWhen certain she compelled the God\u2019s regard, assured her incantations and long prayers were both approved\nand heard, she bade her people bring out the body of her father-in-law\u2014 old Aeson\u2019s worn out body\u2014and when\nshe had buried him in a deep slumber by her spells, as if he were a dead man, she then stretched him out upon a\nbed of herbs.\nShe ordered Jason and his servants thence, and warned them not to spy upon her rites, with eyes profane. As\nsoon as they retired, Medea, with disheveled hair and wild abandon, as a Bacchanalian, paced times three around\nthe blazing altars, while she dipped her torches, splintered at the top, into the trenches, dark: with blood, and lit the\ndipt ends in the sacred altar flames. Times three she purified the ancient man with flames, and thrice with water,\nand three times with sulphur,\u2014as the boiling mixture seethed and bubbled in the brazen cauldron near.\nAnd into this, acerbic juices, roots, and flowers and seeds\u2014from vales Hemonian\u2014 and mixed elixirs, into\nwhich she cast stones of strange virtue from the Orient, and sifted sands of ebbing ocean\u2019s tide; white hoar-frost,\ngathered when the moon was full, the nauseating flesh and luckless wings of the uncanny screech-owl, and the\nentrails from a mysterious animal that changed from wolf to man, from man to wolf again; the scaly sloughing of\na water-snake, the medic liver of a long-lived stag, and the hard beak and head of an old crow which was alive nine\ncenturies before; these, and a thousand nameless things the foreign sorceress prepared and mixed, and blended all\ntogether with a branch of peaceful olive, old and dry with years. \u2014 And while she stirred the withered olive branch\nin the hot mixture, it began to change from brown to green; and presently put forth new leaves, and soon was heavy\nwith a wealth of luscious olives.\u2014As the ever-rising fire threw bubbling froth beyond the cauldron\u2019s rim, the ground\nwas covered with fresh verdure \u2014 flowers and all luxuriant grasses, and green plants.\nMedea, when she saw this wonder took her unsheathed knife and cut the old man\u2019s throat; then, letting all his\nold blood out of him she filled his ancient veins with rich elixir. As he received it through his lips or wound, his\nbeard and hair no longer white with age, turned quickly to their natural vigor, dark and lustrous; and his wasted\nform renewed, appeared in all the vigor of bright youth, no longer lean and sallow, for new blood coursed in his\nwell-filled veins.\u2014Astonished, when released from his deep sleep, and strong in youth, his memory assured him,\nsuch he was years four times ten before that day!\u2014\nBacchus, from his celestial vantage saw this marvel, and convinced his nurses might then all regain their former\nvigor, he pled with Medea to restore their youth. The Colchian woman granted his request.\nSection 3\nPelias.\nMedea and Pelias\nbut so her malice might be satisfied Medea feigned she had a quarrel with her husband, and for safety she had\nfled to Pelias. There, since the king himself was heavy with old age, his daughters gave her generous reception. And\nthese girls the shrewd Medea in a short time won, by her false show of friendliness; and while among the most\nremarkable of her achievements she was telling how she had rejuvenated Aeson, and she dwelt particularly, on that\nstrange event, these daughters were induced to hope that by some skill like this their father might regain his lost\nyouth also. And they begged of her this boon, persuading her to name the price; no matter if it was large. She did\nnot reply at once and seemed to hesitate, and so she held their fond minds in a deep suspense by her feigned med-\nitation. When she had at length declared she would restore his youth, she said to them: \u201cThat you may have strong\nconfidence in this my promised boon, the oldest leader of your flock of sheep shall be changed to a lamb again by\nmy prized drugs.\u201d\nStraightway a wooly ram, worn out with length of untold years was brought, his great horns curved around his\nhollow temples. After she had cut his scrawny throat with her sharp knife Thessalian, barely staining it with his thin\nblood, Medea plunged his carcass in a bronze-made kettle, throwing in it at the same time juices of great potency.\nThese made his body shrink and burnt away his two horns, and with horns his years. And now thin bleating was\nheard from within the pot; and even while they wondered at the sound, a lamb jumped out and frisking, ran away\nto find some udder with its needed milk.\n889 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAmazed the daughters looked on and, now that these promises had been performed, they urged more eagerly\ntheir first request. Three times Phoebus unyoked his steeds after their plunge in Ebro\u2019s stream, and on the fourth\nnight stars shown brilliant on the dark foil of the sky, and then the treacherous daughter of Aeetes set some clear\nwater over a hot fire and put in it herbs of no potency. And now a death-like sleep held the king down, his body all\nrelaxed, and with the king his guards, a sleep which incantations with the potency of magic words had given.\nThe sad king\u2019s daughters, as they had been bid, were in his room, and with Medea stood around his bed. \u201cWhy\ndo you hesitate,\u201d Medea said. \u201cYou laggards, come and draw your swords; let out his old blood that I may refill his\nempty veins again with young blood. In your hands your father\u2019s life and youth are resting. You, his daughters, must\nhave love for him, and if the hopes you have are not all vain, come, do your duty by your father; drive out old age at\nthe point of your good weapons; and let out his blood enfeebled\u2014cure him with the stroke of iron.\u201d\nSpurred on by these words, as each one of them was filial she became the leader in the most unfilial act, and\nthat she might not be most wicked did the wicked deed. Not one could bear to see her own blows, so they turned\ntheir eyes away; and every face averted so, they blindly struck him with their cruel hands. The old man streaming\nwith his blood, still raised himself on elbow, and half mangled tried to get up from his bed; with all those swords\naround him, he stretched out his pale arms and he cried: \u201cWhat will you do, my daughters? What has armed you to\nthe death of your loved father?\u201d Their wrong courage left them, and their hands fell. When he would have said still\nmore, Medea cut his throat and plunged his mangled body into boiling water.\nSection 4\nMedeae fuga.\nOnly because her winged dragons sailed swiftly with her up to the lofty sky, escaped Medea punishment for this\nunheard of crime.\nHer chariot sailed above embowered Pelion\u2014long the lofty home of Chiron\u2014over Othrys, and the vale made\nfamous where Cerambus met his fate. Cerambus, by the aid of nymphs, from there was wafted through the air on\nwings, when earth was covered by the overwhelming sea\u2014 and so escaped Deucalion\u2019s flood, uncrowned.\nShe passed by Pittane upon the left, with its huge serpent-image of hard stone, and also passed the grove called\nIda\u2019s, where the stolen bull was changed by Bacchus\u2019 power into a hunted stag\u2014in that same vale Paris lies buried in\nthe sand; and over fields where Mera warning harked, Medea flew; over the city of Eurypylus upon the Isle of Cos,\nwhose women wore the horns of cattle when from there had gone the herd of Hercules; and over Rhodes beloved\nof Phoebus, where Telchinian tribes dwelt, whose bad eyes corrupting power shot forth;\u2014 Jove, utterly despising,\nthrust them deep beneath his brother\u2019s waves; over the walls of old Carthaea, where Alcidamas had seen with won-\nder a tame dove arise from his own daughter\u2019s body.\nAnd she saw the lakes of Hyrie in Teumesia\u2019s Vale, by swans frequented\u2014There to satisfy his love for Cycnus,\nPhyllius gave two living vultures: shell for him subdued a lion, and delivered it to him; and mastered a great bull, at\nhis command; but when the wearied Phyllius refused to render to his friend the valued bull. Indignant, the youth\nsaid, \u201cYou shall regret your hasty words;\u201d which having said, he leaped from a high precipice, as if to death; but\ngliding through the air, on snow-white wings, was changed into a swan\u2014Dissolved in tears, his mother Hyrie knew\nnot he was saved; and weeping, formed the lake that bears her name.\nAnd over Pleuron, where on trembling wings escaped the mother Combe from her sons, Medea flew; and over\nthe far isle Calauria, sacred to Latona.\u2014She beheld the conscious fields whose lawful king, together with his queen\nwere changed to birds.\nUpon her right Cyllene could be seen; there Menephon, degraded as a beast, outraged his mother. In the dis-\ntance, she beheld Cephisius, who lamented long his hapless grandson, by Apollo changed into a bloated sea-calf.\nAnd she saw the house where king Eumelus mourned the death of his aspiring son.\u2014Borne on the wings of her\nenchanted dragons, she arrived at Corinth, whose inhabitants, \u2018tis said, from many mushrooms, watered by the rain\nsprang into being.\nThere she spent some years. But after the new wife had been burnt by the Colchian witchcraft and two seas had\nseen the king\u2019s own palace all aflame, then, savagely she drew her sword, and bathed it in the blood of her own in-\nfant sons; by which atrocious act she was revenged; and she, a wife and mother, fled the sword of her own husband,\nJason.\nMedea amd Aegeus\nOn the wings of her enchanted Titan Dragons borne, she made escape, securely, nor delayed until she entered\nthe defended walls of great Minerva\u2019s city, at the hour when aged Periphas\u2014transformed by Jove, together with his\nqueen, on eagle wings flew over its encircling walls: with whom the guilty Halcyone, skimming seas safely escaped,\nupon her balanced wings.\n890 Metamorphoses\nAnd after these events, Medea went to Aegeus, king of Athens, where she found protection from her enemies\nfor all this evil done. With added wickedness Aegeus, after that, united her to him in marriage.\u2014\nBook 8\nSection 2\nLabyrinthus. Ariadnes corona.\nMinos and the Minotaur\nKing Minos, when he reached the land of Crete and left his ships, remembered he had made a vow to Jupiter,\nand offered up a hundred bulls.\u2014The splendid spoils of war adorned his palace.\u2014 Now the infamous reproach\nof Crete had grown, till it exposed the double-natured shame. So, Minos, moved to cover his disgrace, resolved to\nhide the monster in a prison, and he built with intricate design, by Daedalus contrived, an architect of wonderful\nability, and famous. This he planned of mazey wanderings that deceived the eyes, and labyrinthic passages involved.\nSo sports the clear Maeander, in the fields of Phrygia winding doubtful; back and forth it meets itself, until the\nwandering stream fatigued, impedes its wearied waters\u2019 flow; from source to sea, from sea to source involved. So\nDaedalus contrived innumerous paths, and windings vague, so intricate that he, the architect, hardly could retrace\nhis steps. In this the Minotaur was long concealed, and there devoured Athenian victims sent three seasons, nine\nyears each, till Theseus, son of Aegeus, slew him and retraced his way, finding the path by Ariadne\u2019s thread. Without\ndelay the victor fled from Crete, together with the loving maid, and sailed for Dia Isle of Naxos, where he left the\nmaid forlorn, abandoned. Her, in time, lamenting and deserted, Bacchus found and for his love immortalized her\nname. He set in the dark heavens the bright crown that rested on her brows. Through the soft air it whirled, while\nall the sparkling jewels changed to flashing fires, assuming in the sky between the Serpent-holder and the Kneeler\nthe well-known shape of Ariadne\u2019s Crown.\n891 "}
