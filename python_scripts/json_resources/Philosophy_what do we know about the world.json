Rhetorical and Argumentative Perspectives is a\nbook trying to answer the title question by contributing to rhetorical and argumentative\nstudies. It consists of papers presented at the \u201cFirst International Conference on Rhetoric in\nCroatia: the Days of Ivo \u0160kari\u0107\u201d. The Conference was organized with the intent of paying\nrespect to the Croatian rhetorician and professor emeritus Ivo \u0160kari\u0107 who was the first to\nintroduce rhetoric at the Department of Phonetics at the Faculty of Humanities and Social\nSciences, University of Zagreb.\nAs a phonetician, professor \u0160kari\u0107 was interested in all aspects of speech and therefore\nrevealed natural connections between phonetics and rhetoric. As a founder of the School of\nRhetoric, he trained many of his students to become teachers of rhetoric and to get involved\nwith rhetorical and argumentation analysis. This conference was a sign of gratitude from his\nstudents.\nThe conference was held at the island of Bra\u010d, professor \u0160kari\u0107's birthplace, between\nApril 19th and 22nd 2012, and it gathered 60 rhetoricians and argumentation scholars from 10\nEuropean countries as well as North America. The papers presented at the conference are\ndistributed into six chapters of the book: Theoretical Perspectives discussing argumentation\ntheory, relations between philosophy and rhetoric, and visual argumentation; Political\nDiscourse presents papers interested in rhetorical strategies and argumentation analysis in\nvarious types of pubic discourse, i.e. parliamentary debates, persuasion in political speeches\netc; The Media chapter presents papers containing rhetorical analyses of the media discourse,\nespecially those interested in figures of speech and the New Media; the Legal Discourse\ndiscusses argumentation and rhetorical strategies in legal discourse; while Education presents\na chapter involved in the importance of the rhetoric in education system, i.e. implementation\nof debate in education, writings of the argumentative genre, etc. The final chapter Other\n1 Approaches shows different approaches to rhetoric illustrating the multidisciplinarity of the\nconference.\nThe common feature of all the papers in the book is the attempt to understand the role\nof rhetoric and argumentation in various types of public discourse and to present\ninterdisciplinary work connecting linguists, phoneticians, philosophers, law experts and\ncommunication scientists in the common ground of rhetoric and argumentation.\nGabrijela Ki\u0161i\u010dek\n2 PROLOGUE\nThe Significance of Ivo \u0160kari\u0107 for the Academic Development of Rhetoric/Public\nSpeaking in Croatia\nGordana Varo\u0161anec-\u0160kari\u0107, University of Zagreb\nProfessor Emeritus Ivo \u0160kari\u0107 was born on 19 April 1933 here in Postira, on the island\nof Bra\u010d and he left us on 29 January 2009. Professor \u0160kari\u0107 was an actual authority in the\nfield of public speaking in Croatia. He authored seven books and about hundred and fifty\nscientific papers and he was also well-known to the Croatian public for his many newspaper\narticles and interviews on television.\nHe published three books on rhetoric, U potrazi za izgubljenim govorom (In Search of\nfor Lost Speech, 1st edition 1982), Temeljci suvremenog govorni\u0161tva (Cornerstones of\nContemporary Rhetoric, 2000, 2nd edition 2003) and Argumentacija (Argumentation, 2011).\nThe last one \u2013 Argumentacija \u2013 was published posthumously at the end of 2011. During the\nlast years of his life, rethinking the meaning of science, and possible truth in rhetoric, he\nreturned to the values of Nietzsche, Husserl, and Heidegger, shaping his understanding of\nargumentation, by respecting the past and incorporating it into present, consciously\ncontemplating possible thematic fields of argumentation, including the one about decisions\nhaving future consequences.\nHe published many articles in the field of public speaking, for example Culture of\nPublic Speaking Programme, Culture and Speaking, Culture of Speaking - Quality and\nQuantity, Measuring the Culture of Speaking, Culture of Speaking or by Speaking, Speech\nUniversals, Euphony, Logic, Attentive Speech Listening, Identification Through Speech,\n3 Speaking Technique, Speech Volume, Time of Speaking, Speech Cognition, Speech \u2013 Cold\nMedium, Poetics in Speech, Conventional Speech, Rhetoric, Speech Preparation.\nHis passion for rhetoric culminated in his work with young enthusiasts resulting in his\nultimate masterpiece \u2013 founding of The School of Rhetoric with the Department of Phonetics\nof the Croatian Philological Society and the Ministry of Science, Education and Sport of the\nRepublic of Croatia. The School started amidst the Croatian War for Independence in 1992 in\nMali Lo\u0161inj, and Professor \u0160kari\u0107 supervised it for 17 years. His precious work continues to\nlive on under the name: The School of Rhetoric \u201cIvo \u0160kari\u0107\u201d. His ideas are revived twice a\nyear through young secondary school students who are developing critical thinking and are\ntaught how to face future endeavours by acquiring speaking skills.\nHe believed that democracy is a spoken culture, and so for youth to be prepared for\nlife they needed to be good speakers. He relied on logos, since the main goal of rhetorical\neducation is rational speaking and young people should be taught to think argumentatively,\nfocussing on thinking as a prerequisite for well-structured speaking.\nWe should always remember the legacy he left to his students \u2013 that critical discourse\nis passionate and ethical, and not cold (that is, a cunning and deceitful discourse), and that\nalthough it is in our nature to understand the world around us in terms of cause and effect, it\ndoes not imply that we should not fight for what is truly important, defendable and ethical,\neven when we are aware of the final consequences.\n4 I. THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES\n5 The Elements of Argument: Six Steps To A Thick Theory\nLeo Groarke, University of Windsor\nSummary\nIn the last quarter-century, the emergence of argumentation theory has spurred the development of an extensive\nliterature on the study of argument. It encompasses empirical and theoretical investigations that often have their\nroots in the different traditions that have studied argument since ancient times \u2013 most notably, logic, rhetoric,\nand dialectics. Against this background, I advocate a \u201cthick\u201d theory of argument that merges traditional theories,\nweaving together their sometimes discordant approaches to provide an overarching framework for the\nassessment of arguments in a broad range of contexts. In sketching such a theory, I propose six steps that can\n\u201cthicken\u201d traditional approaches to argument in the interests of a comprehensive theory.\nKey words: the future of argumentation theory, thick theory of arguments, thin theory of\narguments\n1. Introduction\nInternational scholarship over the last quarter-century has been characterized by an\nexplosive growth of interest in argument as a topic of inquiry. An impressive range of\ndisciplines and sub-disciplines have been involved. They include philosophy, rhetoric,\ndialectics (notably pragma-dialectics), informal (and formal) logic, linguistics, discourse\nanalysis, computational modeling, artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology. The results\nare evident in burgeoning scholarship on competing theories of argument; in pedagogical\nresearch that explores different ways of teaching and testing reasoning and argument; in case\nstudies of particular kinds of argument; in formal systems of reasoning and \u201cassisted\u201d\nreasoning; and in historical studies of the theories of argument that characterize different\nthinkers, times and places.\n6 I propose a view of these developments that understands them as steps toward a\ngeneral (\u201cumbrella\u201d) theory of argument that can be used to analyze, assess and explain\narguments as they occur in a broad range of contexts. I describe the theory this implies as a\n\u201cthick theory of argument.\u201d Its goals might be contrasted with the goals of many thin theories\nthat have a narrower scope and focus. The latter may provide a detailed account of one kind\nof argument: say arguments by analogy or the sorites argument. In other cases, they attempt to\nexplain some specific aspect of argument (e.g., the role that questions or quantifiers play in\nargument) or the arguments that occur within a specific kind of context (as instances of\n\u201cnegotiation dialogue,\u201d for example, or a specific variant of such dialogue like family\nmediation).\nLike its physical counterpart, theoretical thickness and thinness is a matter of degree.\nA theory of ad hominem argument is thicker than an account of guilt by association\narguments, which can be understood as a subspecies of ad hominem, but thinner than a\ncomprehensive account of fallacies. A theory of argument schemes and their role in argument\nanalysis is thicker than a theory of causal or deductive schemes, but thinner than a theory\nwhich features schemes as one of a series of conceptual tools (fallacies, dialogical\nconsiderations, etc.) proposed for argument analysis. My interest is the construction of a\ntheory that is thick enough to be the basis of argument analysis and assessment in as broad a\nrange of contexts as possible. I shall present a way of accomplishing such a theory which\nproceeds by broadening and enriching (by \u201cthickening\u201d) traditional and contemporary\naccounts of argument.\nIn sketching a thick theory, I do not mean to diminish the significance of thinner\ntheories. One misunderstands the thick/thin distinction if one understands it as a distinction\nbetween better and worse accounts of argument. If we imagine argumentation as one kind of\ncommunication, then we can think of a thick theory as a general account of such\n7 communication. While it attempts to provide a unifying account of all arguments that can\nexplain their elements and how they work, it cannot encompass a detailed account of every\naspect of every kind of argument. When analyzing an argument in law, parliamentary debate\nor physics, this may mean that one needs to supplement a thick theory with a thinner one that\nelaborates its general principles in this specific context. To the extent that it is possible, a fully\ncomplete account of argument analysis and evaluation would have to combine a thick theory\nwith thin theories that provide a more detailed account of the kinds (and aspects) of argument\nit identifies.\nIn this essay, my interest is a thick theory. To that end, I propose six steps that\nculminate in such a theory. I think the time is ripe for such development, primarily because of\nthe emergence of \u201cargumentation theory,\u201d a contemporary amalgam of disciplines that aims to\nbetter understand argument as it naturally occurs in a great variety of contexts. I shall argue\nthat the standard approaches to argument that characterize different branches of\nargumentation theory successfully illuminate key components of argument, but fall short\nwhen they are proposed as a general account of argument. I will try to thicken them by\nweaving together some of the disparate and contrary threads that they contain. In sketching\nsix steps to a thick theory I aim to push the development of argumentation theory in this\ndirection.\n2. Step One: Beginning with Logic\nOne could root a thick theory in the approaches to argument that characterize logic,\nrhetoric or dialectics. I begin with classical logic\u2019s account of argument for autobiographical\nreasons \u2013 because my own interest in argument is rooted in philosophy and logic. Logic\nunderstands an argument as a set of propositions (a set of claims about what is true) which\ncontains a proposition which is proposed as a conclusion and others which function as\n8 premises that offer evidence in support of it. A standard (if hackneyed) example is the\nBarbara syllogism: \u201cAll men are mortal. Socrates is a man. So Socrates is mortal.\u201d\nTraditionally, a good argument is understood as a \u201csound\u201d argument which has true premises\nand a conclusion that necessarily (deductively) follows from them.\nAristotle offers an account of demonstration along these lines in his Prior Analytics,\nwhere he defines a syllogism, the basis of demonstration, as a \u201cdiscourse (logos) in which,\ncertain things being stated, something other than what is stated follows of necessity from their\nbeing so.\u201d (2000a, 1.2). Here each of the \u201ccertain things being stated\u201d is a premise (protasis)\nof the argument, and the \u201csomething other than what is stated\u201d which \u201cfollows of necessity\u201d is\nits conclusion (sumperasma).\nLogic\u2019s premise/conclusion account of argument is a common one that has been\nfeatured in thousands of introductions to logic and philosophy. One of its strengths is its\nnormative dimension \u2013 its commitment to techniques that can be used to assess the arguments\nit considers. This side of formal logic is elaborated and used to analyze, construct, and assess\nparticular instances of argument. In systems of formal logic they incorporate truth tables and\ntrees as methods for testing valid inferences, and rules of inference (modus ponens, the \u201cRule\nof Necessitation\u201d, etc.) which allow the step by step construction of proofs which lead from\ngiven premises to conclusions that follow from them. The development of formal systems has\ngiven rise to sophisticated accounts of argument which play a practical role in computing and\ncomputational modeling.\n\u201cInformal\u201d logic is an offshoot of classical logic that has focused on the informal\narguments that characterize day to day contexts (in social and political controversy, personal\nexchange, public discourse, news coverage, advocacy and advertising, and so on). Because\njudgments of truth and falsity may be difficult to make in such contexts, it may assess\npremises in terms of their plausibility, probability, or \u201cacceptability.\u201d The latter leaves open\n9 the possibility of truth understood as one kind of acceptability but introduces the possibility of\nothers. In judging the mechanics of argument, one might compare formal logic\u2019s rules of\ninference to informal logic\u2019s attempt to identify and elaborate different kinds of argument\nschemes (argument by authority, causal generalizations, arguments by analogy, etc.) which\ninfer particular kinds of conclusions from premises that answer \u201ccritical questions\u201d in each\ncase. An alternative method of judging arguments is fallacy theory, which diagnoses the\nproblems with weak arguments by identifying common mistakes that they commit.\nTraditional lists of fallacies include problems with deductive reasoning (e.g., affirming the\nconsequent), issues with premises (as in false dilemma and begging the question) and weak\ninferences (e.g., ad populum, ad baculum, and ad misercordiam).\nIn the present context, it is notable that informal logic is an attempt to create a thicker\ntheory of argument than that which characterizes classical logic. In its attempt to encompass a\nbroader range of argument, it proposes more broadly applicable accounts of premise\nacceptability and valid (and invalid) inference. In the process, it provides a general theory of\nargument that can be applied to everyday arguments that are not easily analyzed or assessed\nusing formal logic\u2019s classical account of argument. This expands the scope of logic, but\ninformal logic (at least as it was initially conceived) still has shortcomings when it is\nproposed as a thick theory. To better understand these limits and how they can be overcome\nwe need to turn to key aspects of argument that are better recognized by the disciplines of\nrhetoric and dialectics.\n3. Step Two: Argument in its Rhetorical Context\nFollowing O\u2019Keefe, 1977, many studies of argument have distinguished two meanings\nof the word \u201cargument\u201d that he labels \u201cargument \u201d and \u201cargument .\u201d Both meanings have\n1 2\ntheir roots in ordinary English, where the observation that someone argued may mean that\n10 they offered premises in favour of some conclusion (argument ) or, more simply, that they\n1\nstrongly disagreed with someone (argument ). The latter notion underscores the interactions\n2\nin which arguments in the logician\u2019s sense (instances of argument ) are embedded. More\n1\ngenerally, premise/conclusion arguments are embedded in uncertainty, which can arise from\ntoo much opinion (when arguers disagree) or too little (when arguers do not know what to\nthink).\nWe can visually represent the relationship between arguments and their contexts of\nuncertainty as I have below. Above all else, this highlights the extent to which real arguments\nare not abstract entities, but tools with a concrete purpose: to resolve the uncertainty (and\ndisagreement) that gives rise to them. In attempts to analyze and assess arguments as\nsuccessful and unsuccessful, this means that we need to ask whether they successfully resolve\nthe uncertainty they respond to. As this uncertainty resides in a group of people, a successful\nargument in practice is one which convincingly addresses them and eliminates their\nuncertainty.\nConditions of Uncertainty\nPremises in support of a\nconclusion (argument )\n1\nHistorically, this aspect of argument has been better recognized by rhetoric than logic.\nIt understands an argument as a vehicle of persuasion, and a strong argument as a successful\n11 attempt to persuade an intended audience of some point of view. Logic suggests that a good\narguer constructs an argument by assembling premises they know (or think they know) to be\ntrue. Rhetoric proposes a fundamentally different approach, suggesting that an arguer begin\nby analyzing the audience to which their argument is directed, and by looking for premises\nthat this audience finds acceptable. In real life circumstances, this has always been the\nstrategy of adept arguers, who tailor their arguments to the audiences they address. Among\nother things, this implies that an arguer should use different premises when they address\ndifferent audiences. If one wishes to argue that nationalism is an evil (or a boon), this suggests\nthat one should use different arguments when one addresses Croatians, Mexican Americans,\nIndigenous people in Canada, Swedes, the United Nations, conservatives, libertarians, the so\ncalled \u201cuniversal audience,\u201d and so on.\nIn the attempt to create a truly general theory of argument, these considerations make\naudience a key component of argumentation which is missing logic\u2019s account of argument.\nThe easiest way to rectify this shortcoming is as Aristotle suggests in his Rhetoric: by\nunderstanding a successful argument as one that is logically impeccable and constructed in a\nmanner that successfully addresses its audience\u2019s beliefs and convictions (their pathos). If one\nwishes to be a successful arguer, this means that it is not enough to employ premises one\nbelieves to be acceptable; one must go further and find premises that are acceptable to the\naudience one addresses. Creating a thick theory that recognizes this can dissipate some of the\ntension between logical and rhetorical conceptions of argument, accommodating key\ncomponents of both in a \u201crhetorically enhanced\u201d theory that recognizes audience as an\nelement of successful argument. In the present context, I will treat this view of argument as a\nsecond step towards a thick theory that allows us to analyze and judge an argument from the\npoint of view of logic (the acceptability of the premises, the strength of an inference, etc.)\nand/or the rhetorical requirement that it speak to the audience it addresses.\n12 4. Step Three: Argument in its Dialectical Context\nInsofar as rhetoric highlights the role of audience in argument, it identifies one facet of\nan argument\u2019s context which must be recognized by a thick theory. One finds another in an\nargument\u2019s relationship to opposing points of view. Considered from this perspective,\narguments are embedded in a context which typically includes an exchange between opposing\npoints of view and the opposing arguments they produce. The construction of opposing\narguments is an iterative process, making one argument a move in a broader dialectical\nexchange between arguers and their opponents (in some cases, arguers may be their own\nopponent, arguing \u2018with themselves,\u2019 defending opposing points of view). The dialectical\nview of argument this implies has an impressive lineage that is evident in Plato\u2019s dialogues,\nwhere interlocutors (usually Socrates and his antagonists) develop arguments and\ncounterarguments for opposing points of view.\nLike rhetoric, dialectics underscores the extent to which logic has traditionally treated\narguments in a manner that removes them from the contexts in which they are embedded. In\ncontrast, dialectics analyzes an argument by asking whether it is a reasonable move in an\nexchange between the proponents and opponents of the view that it defends. This approach\nsuggests that a good argument must, among other things, successfully answer (and anticipate)\nopposing points of view. Johnson, 2000, endorses a dialectical approach when he maintains\nthat arguments have a \u201cdialectical tier\u201d beyond the \u201cilliative\u201d core that logic recognizes; and\nthat arguers have \u201cdialectical obligations\u201d requiring them to address competing arguments and\npoints of view. A good argument for the conclusion that homosexual marriage is a right must,\nthis suggests, include acceptable premises, a strong inference and an answer to the objections\nof those who think otherwise.\n13 Johnson concludes that the conception of argument that characterizes the history of\nlogic \u2014 the giving of premises for a conclusion \u2013 is, without elaboration, only a \u201cproto-\nargument.\u201d In the building of a thick theory, the dialectical view suggests that a complete\naccount of premise and conclusion arguments needs to be a \u201cdialectically enhanced\u201d version\nof logic\u2019s account of argument. The resulting theory must recognize dialectical considerations\nas a key component of argument analysis. Doing so adds a fourth element to our thick theory\nof argument: which must recognize premises, conclusions, audience and dialectical context as\ncentral ingredients of successful argument. I shall take this rhetorically and dialectically\nenhanced account of argument as our third step in the development of a thick theory.\n5. Step Four: Argument in its Dialogical Context\nYet another approach to argument which emphasizes the context in which arguments\noccur is dialogue theory. It suggests that we understand an argument as an element in a\n\u201cdialogue\u201d which establishes parameters that dictate those moves that are acceptable and\nunacceptable in argument. In their classic account of pragma-dialectics, van Eemeren and\nGrootendorst, 1992, situate argumentation within a form of dialogue they call a \u201ccritical\ndiscussion.\u201d The theory of argument they develop distinguishes different stages of critical\ndiscussion (confrontation, opening, argumentation, closing) and elaborates rules that regulate\nthe discussion at each stage. Good arguments are arguments that abide by the rules; poor\narguments are arguments that fail to do so. In the process, fallacies are explained as violations\nof these rules.\nIn the building of a thick theory of argument pragma-dialectics tells us that arguments\nmust be understood as elements of a form of dialogue which implies normative rules that\ndelineate right and wrong ways to argue. From a pragma-dialectical point of view, we can\n14 diagram the general structure of premise/conclusion arguments as I have below. I will\ndescribe this structure by saying that the rules of critical discussion\nConditions of Uncertainty\nCr itical Discussion\nPremises and Conclusion\nestablish a dialogical frame of reference (or, more simply, \u201ca frame\u201d) in which arguments\noccur (in passing it bears mention that Entman, 1993, and others use the word \u201cframe\u201d in a\ndifferent way). Analyzing and evaluating arguments that occur within this frame must be done\nin accordance with the rules the frame implies.\nIn the evolution of argumentation theory, the pragma-dialectical account of critical\ndiscussions is a game-changing move because it recognizes dialogical frames as a previously\nneglected element of argument. The significance of this move is even more evident in\nsubsequent discussions in argumentation theory, which identify other kinds of dialogue which\nare characterized by different frames \u2013 and the different goals, structures, and rules of\nengagement they incorporate. In his work, Walton has proposed seven different kinds of\ndialogue which have as their purpose: persuasion, inquiry, discovery, negotiation, information,\ndeliberation and eristic exchange (see 2007). The distinction between these different kinds of\ndialogue has significant implications for the analysis of specific instances of argument, as\n15 each is characterized by a distinct frame which implies unique procedural rules and unique\nstandards for success.\nIn an inquiry dialogue, arguments are exchanged to establish what is true. The\ndialogue is characterized by strict standards that determine what counts as evidence and\ncounter-evidence for a particular conclusion. In contrast, a negotiation dialogue does not\nattempt to establish truth, but to bargain in a way that reconciles the competing interests of the\nparties who negotiate. In the case of collective bargaining, one species of negotiation dialogue,\narguing is unacceptable it is \u201cbargaining in bad faith\u201d \u2013 by, for example, bargaining directly\nwith the members of the union or the executive of the corporation rather than the team that\nrepresents them. This procedural rule has no obvious analogue in an inquiry dialogue. Neither\ndo the standards for good argument. Threats have, for example, no legitimate role to play in\ninquiry dialogue (where they can be rejected as instances of the fallacy ad baculum), but play\nan essential place in collective bargaining, which is ultimately founded on the threat of a\nstrike or a lock out.\nWithin argumentation, there are many instances in which dialogical frames are\nthemselves matters of dispute and argument. Strategic arguers may move to ensure that the\narguments they present occur within the frame in which they are most likely to be successful.\nThe standards of evidence in tort law are, for example, looser than those that apply in criminal\nlaw. In view of this, the parents of O.J. Simpson\u2019s apparent victims sued him in civil court\nafter he was found not guilty at his famous criminal trial. By moving the arguments to this\nnew frame they were successful in securing substantial damages. In other situations,\nmediation would introduce yet another frame of reference.\nIn the development of a thick theory of argument, the role that frames play in\ndetermining standards of argument means that a theory which aims to provide a truly general\naccount of argument must be dialogically (as well as dialectically and rhetorically) enhanced.\n16 I will therefore propose the recognition of dialogues and the frames that accompany them as a\nfourth step in our development of a thick theory.\n6. Step Five: Multi-Modal Argument\nSteps 2, 3 and 4 in our thick theory all extend logic\u2019s traditional account of argument\nso that it recognizes the role that context plays in instances of argument. The final two steps I\nwant to propose as a route to a thick theory move in a different direction, broadening the\nscope of what logic (and most argumentation traditions) counts as argument. Step 5 is a\nbroadening of the notion of argument beyond the assumption that arguments are conveyed\nverbally, as collections of sentences. In response to this assumption, many commentators have\nnow argued that arguments can be expressed and communicated in non-verbal ways (see, e.g.,\nBirdsell and Groarke, 2008; Blair, 1996; Dove, 2012; Groarke, 1996; Roque, 2008; Shelley,\n1996; Slade, 2002; van den Hoven, 2011). Even textbooks have extended their accounts of\nargument to make room for non-verbal instances of argument (see Groarke and Tindale, 2013;\nand Lunsford et. al., 2010). While some sceptics remain (notably Fleming, 1996 and Johnson,\n2005), the thick theory I propose \u2013 which aims for as broad a theory of argument as possible \u2013\nexplicitly includes \u201cmulti-modal\u201d arguments which have non-verbal elements.\nThe fundamental reason for accepting multi-modal arguments is the root notion that an\nargument is an attempt to support a conclusion by presenting evidence for it \u2013 something that\ncan clearly be done in ways that extend beyond premises and conclusions understood as\ndeclarative sentences. To take only a few examples, I may try to convince you of some claim\nby presenting photographs, drawing a map, pointing to something, telling a story (fiction or\nnon-fiction), showing a film, painting a picture, and so on and so forth. Our lives are replete\nwith situations in which evidence for some point of view is presented in these and other ways\n17 that do not neatly correspond to the verbal paradigm that was always stressed in traditional\naccounts of argument.\nIn this essay, I will confine myself to one personal example. Consider a debate spurred\nby an unusual fruit I discovered during a kayak ride on the Detroit River. When my\ndescription (\u201cnothing I recognize; a bumpy, yellow skin\u201d) initiated a debate and competing\nhypotheses on the identity of the fruit, I went back and took the photographs reproduced\nbelow. On the basis of these photographs, the fruit was quickly identified as beadfruit.\n18 The argument that established this conclusion compared my photographs to similar\nphotographs found in encyclopedia accounts of breadfruit. One might summarize the\nreasoning as: \u201cThe fruit is breadfruit, for these photographs are like standard photographs of\nbreadfruit.\u201d But this is just a verbal paraphrase. The actual reasoning \u2013 what convinces one of\nthe conclusion is the seeing of the sets of photographs in question. Using a variant of standard\ndiagram techniques for argument analysis, we might map the structure of the argument as:\nI1 + I2\nC\nwhere C is the conclusion that the fruit is a piece of breadfruit, I1 is the set of photographs I\ntook, and I2 is the iconic photographs of breadfruit to which they were compared.\n19 One might compare many other instances of reasoning \u2013 identifying a criminal by\nlooking at their \u201cmug shot\u201d; identifying an insect by comparing it to a preserved specimen;\nand so on. These are instances of \u201cvisual demonstration\u201d \u2013 arguments which prove something\nby visually demonstrating that it is so (for a discussion, see Groarke and Tindale, 2013;\nBirdsell and Groarke, 2008). Other kinds of visual argument operate in different ways, by\ninvoking visual symbols, metaphors, and so on. At a time when the development of digital\ncommunication is making it easier to transmit images, sounds, and even physical sensations, it\nis not surprising that arguments increasingly incorporate non-verbal elements that can be\ncommunicated in this way. Especially in such a context, recognizing multi-modal arguments\nis one way to broaden the scope of our general account of argument, taking us one step further\nin the development of a thick theory.\n7. Step Six: Argument and Emotion\nThe last step I propose to take in developing a thick theory may be the most\ncontroversial. In some ways it is anticipated by Hample, who has criticized \u201cthe absence of\nemotions in argumentation theory,\u201d remarking that \u201cour culture has inherited a persistent and\nbad idea, namely that rationality and emotionality are opposites. Arguing is identified with\nreason, which is held to be the opponent and discipline to passion.\u201d (2005, 126-127) The split\nbetween reason and emotion this refers to is especially common in logic and philosophy. It is\ntied to an influential view of argument that can be called \u201cthe cognitive account.\u201d This\naccount sees argument as an attempt to judge truth and establish knowledge in a manner that\neschews the emotions and the passions.\nOne might maintain the plausibility of the cognitive account in some contexts \u2013 e.g.,\nmathematics and science. In other contexts which are highly charged with emotion, it may\nusefully explain what goes wrong in arguing. In judging who is right and who is wrong in\n20 contentious divorce proceedings, the cognitive account tells us that the ideal arguer proceeds\nby dispassionately marshalling evidence for and against particular conclusions. This implies\nan unemotional approach to argument that is not unduly influenced by loyalty, sympathy or\nantipathy toward one of the principals in question, or by hopes and desires about the outcome.\nIn this and other contexts which naturally engage the emotions, the tendency to draw\nconclusions on the basis of emotional reactions rather than evidence may be prevalent and\npronounced.\nIn such cases, the cognitive account usefully points out that emotion interferes with\ncogent reasoning. But we should not make too much of this. Concluding that emotions have\nno place in the realm of argument is like concluding that appeals to authority have no place in\nargument because they often go amiss. In a great many situations, emotions have a legitimate\nrole to play in our decision to accept or reject particular conclusions: because these\nconclusions resonate with our ideals, our dislike of particular actions, our affection for our\nloved ones, and so on. Compassion for the victims of an earthquake or tsunami is appropriate,\nnot inappropriate, when deciding whether one should contribute to a charity that aims to\nsupport them. Loving or fearing someone may give one strong reasons to conclude that they\nshould be treated or viewed in certain ways. A prevalent lack of empathy is not a positive trait\nin thinking, but a defining feature of psychopathy, which is a mental disorder.\nIn the real world of argument, many arguments are explicitly designed to foster our\nemotions. Such arguments may rouse a team before a soccer game, generate public concern\nabout an invasive species, or foster support for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to\nAnimals. While specific examples of such arguments may go too far, it makes little sense to\nsay that they are in principle illegitimate, or that excitement, fear, anger, disgust, hope,\nsympathy, and happiness should never play a role supporting some conclusions and\nmitigating against others. In a poll of scholars of American public address, Martin Luther\n21 King\u2019s \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech (American Rhetoric, 2012) has been ranked as the most\nsignificant political speech of the 20th century. Delivered to over two hundred thousand civil\nrights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial on August 28th 1963, it was a defining moment in the\nAmerican Civil Rights Movement. The speech presents a powerful argument for civil rights\nwhich cannot be understood apart from King\u2019s success stirring the emotional convictions of\nhis audience.\nThe influence of the cognitive account of argument on argumentation theory is seen in\nthe history of fallacy theory, which has treated appeals to emotion as mistakes in argument.\nThe standard list of fallacies thus includes appeal to pity (ad misercordiam), appeal to flattery,\nattacking the person (ad hominem), appeal to force (ad baculum) and, more generally, appeal\nto emotion. Recent work on argument has made it increasingly evident that this is too simple:\nthat we cannot easily relegate all appeals to emotion to the realm of fallacies, and that many\nsuch appeals provide reasonable grounds for belief and action. To take one example,\nWreen,1988a and 1988b, has argued that appeal to force (ad baculum) is an argument scheme\nthat has rationally compelling instances. One cannot dismiss all instances of the scheme on\nthe basis of the claim that it is predicated on an appeal to fear, for fear may be reasonable and\nmay be a legitimate consideration in the drawing of conclusions. If you tell me that I should\ngive you my wallet because you will shoot me with a gun in your hand if I don\u2019t, then I would\nbe acting unreasonably if I did not accept this conclusion (telling someone with a gun that\nthey are committing the fallacy ad baculum is not a recommended course of action). A\nnumber of other commentators have argued for a rethinking of the fallacies that treats ad\nhominem and other fallacies associated with emotions as legitimate forms of argument (see,\ne.g., Govier, 1983; Groarke and Tindale, 1986; Hitchcock, 2006).\nThe role of emotion in argument is particularly salient if one\u2019s goal is a thick theory of\nargument, for such a theory must provide an overarching account of argument that is\n22 applicable in a broad range of contexts. Such a theory must, in particular, be able to provide\nan account of argument that can analyze and assess arguments in a variety of contexts which\nare inherently emotional: in political, moral, social and aesthetic debate; in interpersonal\nexchange; in mediation and conflict resolution; in bargaining; and so on. In the realm of\nevaluation, this means that a thick theory must be able to distinguish between legitimate and\nillegitimate (and more and less legitimate) emotional appeals. For though it is clear that\nemotion can play a legitimate role in such contexts, it is equally clear that arguers may treat\nthem as opportunities to manipulate emotions and illegitimately establish their conclusions.\nArguments in sales and advertising, with their very consciously designed appeals to our\ndesires and hopes and fears (about sex, health, material possessions, etc.) are notorious for\nsuch appeals.\nThis is not the place for the development of a detailed account of how to analyze and\nassess emotion in arguments, but it behooves us to say something in this regard. To begin\nwith, it may be said that there are important ancient precedents for recognizing the extent to\nwhich emotions influence argument (and vice-versa). In sharp contrast to the cognitive\napproach to argument, they view emotion\u2019s association with argument as an opportunity that\nadept arguers should explore, cultivate and exploit.\nSuch an attitude is an essential component of ancient sophism and ancient rhetoric,\nwhich are key instances of argumentation theory (for a recent attempt to rehabilitate the\nsophists as theorists, see Tindale, 2010). Gorgias, famous for his ability to argue anything,\nunabashedly champions the ability of argumentative discourse to provoke emotion, claiming\nthat it accomplishes \u201cmiraculous works; for it can stop fear and assuage pain and produce joy\nand make mercy abound,\u201d producing \u201cfearful shuddering and tearful pity and sorrowful\nlonging\u201d (1999, 9). Emphasizing the emotional power of words, he compares them to drugs,\n\u201cFor just as different drugs draw off different humors from the body, and some put an end to\n23 disease and others to life, so too of discourses: some give pain, others delight, others terrify,\nothers rouse the hearers to courage, and yet others by a certain vile persuasion drug and trick\nthe soul\u201d (1999, 14).\nAristotle is impatient with Gorgias and the sophists, but the rhetorical tradition he\ninitiates also recognizes emotion as a key component of argument, emphasizing the role that\npathos plays in persuasive arguments. Literally, the word pathos means \u201cfeeling\u201d or\n\u201caffection\u201d, making the attempt to speak to an audience\u2019s path\u0113 an attempt to appeal, not\nmerely to what they believe, but to their feelings and their emotional attachments. In\nconstructing arguments this means that we need to consider the emotional as well as the\ncognitive commitments of our audience.\nIn contemporary argumentation theory, the most direct call for a recognition of\nemotional argument is found in Gilbert, 1997; 2004. He expands the standard account of\nargument so that it includes an \u201cemotional mode\u201d which may employ emotion as a reason for\na conclusion or an expression of emotion as a means of conveying an argument. On this\naccount, a lover\u2019s outpouring of emotion may function as a good reason for accepting an\nentreaty to do what they desire. According to Gilbert, the strength of an emotional argument\ndepends upon \u201csuch elements as degree of commitment, depth, and the extent of feeling,\nsincerity and the degree of resistance\" (1997, 83-84; Carozza 2009 further develops this\naccount). One way to incorporate this into a theory of argument is by broadening the notion of\npremise and conclusion acceptability one employs so that it incorporates some notion of\nemotional acceptability. Whichever way one goes, recognizing emotion as a legitimate\ncomponent of argument thickens one\u2019s account of argument dramatically, taking us one step\nfurther in the development of a thick theory.\n8. Conclusion: The Elements of Argument\n24 In this essay, I have tried to sketch the outlines of a thick theory of argument. We\nmight summarize the theory I have suggested by saying that it recognizes seven elements of\nargument which need to be considered in a comprehensive theory of argument. We might\ndescribe these elements as: premises, conclusions, audience, dialectical exchange, dialogical\nframes, multi-modal discourse, and emotional content. While this list significantly thickens\ntraditional accounts of argument, I do not offer it as definitive. Argumentation theory is, in a\nnumber of ways, engaged in working out a comprehensive list. In the final analysis, there may\nbe other elements of argument that it should recognize. Hample, 1985, has, for example,\nsuggested a notion of argument defined in terms of its cognitive dimensions (the mental\nprocesses by which argument occurs within individual arguers) that he calls argument . This\n0\nmay point to another dimension of argument that needs to be considered. I leave a discussion\nof this and other possibilities for elsewhere, though it bears mention that the ultimate elements\nof argument must be elements that are not reducible to other elements.\nThis is not the place for an elaboration of what a recognition of the elements of\nargument imply for the analysis and evaluation of argument (much less specific arguments\nand specific instances of argument). It must nonetheless be said that the importance of the\ndifferent elements of argument differs depending on the argument in question. If we think of\none dimension of argument corresponding to each element, then it may be said that different\narguments are situated at different places within these seven dimensions. As an object may be\ntwo rather than three dimensional, an argument may be two or three or four or seven\ndimensional. The assessment of some arguments will be heavily determined by dialogical\nframes, others not. Some, but not others, will be packed with emotional content. And so on.\nIn the context of argument evaluation it might be said that different kinds of argument\nevaluation address the different dimensions of argument. In judging an argument we may\ndecide to judge the extent to which its premises are acceptable; the extent to which its\n25 conclusion follows from its premises; the extent to which it successfully addresses its\naudience; the extent to which it is dialectically or dialogically appropriate; the extent to which\nit is well expressed in multi-modal terms; and/or the extent to which it is emotionally\nsuccessful. It goes without saying that each of these assessments warrants an extended\ndiscussion of its own. For the moment it must suffice to say that the theories that this requires\ncan be seen as further components of the thick theory I propose.\nReferences\nAmerican Rhetoric. \u201cTop 100 Speeches.\u201d\nhttp://www.americanrhetoric.com/newtop100speeches.htm.\nAristotle.

TAL tries to show how certain argumentative features and argumentative orientation(s) are already written in\nthe lexical and syntactical constructions; how, on certain levels, language seems to argue by and for itself; and how it\ncan (and does) impose restrictions on our own (dialogical and interactive) argumentation.\nThis paper will show how Bakhtin's concepts of reported speech and dialogism were \"borrowed\" by Ducrot and\nelaborated into one of the key concepts of TAL, the concept of polyphony. The shaping and transformations of\nDucrot's theory will be presented, why and how the concept of polyphony was (and had to be) introduced, how it was\nexpanded and supplemented with the concept of topoi, as well as how these two concepts are used within TAL.\nKey words: polyphony, topoi, argumentative orientation, argumentation in the language-system,\nDucrot\nFor almost 40 years a French linguist Oswald Ducrot (1972, 1973, 1980, 1983 (with J.\nC. Anscombre), 1984, 1996, 2009) has been trying to develop his own theory of\nargumentation \u2013 a theory very different from the \u201cmainstream\u201d argumentation theories \u2013, a\ntheory of \u201cargumentation in the language-system\u201d (TAL from now on).\nIn this paper, I will try to shed some light on the shaping and the development of this\ntheory, the transformation of its conceptual apparatus and its analytical scope, and try to point\nat some possible problems at the same time. My main point of interest will be the concept of\npolyphony, therefore I shall have neither time (n)or space to discuss all the problems and\n29 transformations Ducrot's theory is currently undergoing (e.g. theory of semantic blocks). Also,\nbecause of its general character, this overview will have to be more or less schematic.\nIn the second part of the eighties1, Ducrot used to distinguish four phases in the\ndevelopment of his theory of argumentation:\n- the strong informativistic version\n- the weak informativistic version\n- the weak version of argumentation in language, and\n- the strong version of argumentation in language.\nThe latter is (still) in a critical stage of formation and transformation.\n1.1. Informativeness and argumentativeness\nThe basic supposition of the first, i.e. \u201cstrong informativistic\u201d version \u2013 which Ducrot\nnever really advocated, but used as a (presupposed) theory in opposition to which he\nconstructed his own theory instead \u2013 is the postulate that every conclusion or, more accurately,\nevery instance of putting forward an argument towards a conclusion, is based solely on \u201cfacts\u201d\nconveyed (represented) by an utterance-argument. If it is possible to draw a C(onclusion)\nfrom an A(rgument), this is the case because the utterance A \u201cfactually\u201d supports the\nutterance C: by quoting or presenting or referring to some \u201cfacts\u201d that speak in favour of the\nutterance C. A different kind of support (if only subsidiary), for example a structural linguistic\nsupport (i.e. making use of special language particles, argumentative connectives or\nargumentative indicators), is not considered as a serious theoretical option.\n1 Lectures at Ecole des Hautes Etudes in Sciences Sociales, Paris, 1986 - 1989.\n30 Therefore, if the utterance\n(1) Janez studied for only an hour or so\ncan be used as an argument or can serve as an argument supporting the conclusion\n(2) He won't pass the exam\nthen \u2013 in accordance with the \u201cstrong informativistic\u201d thesis \u2013 this can be done only on the\nbasis of the \u201cfact(s)\u201d that Janez (in fact) studied for only an hour or so, and that an hour of\nstudying is (usually, i.e. according to \"average\" experience) not enough to pass an exam.\nWithin the framework of the \"strong informativistic\" version such a conclusion is not (co)-\nsupported by the argumentative orientation of the particle only, the orientation, which is the\ndomain of language as a system2, and does not pertain to extra-linguistic \u201cfactuality.\u201d In\nexample (1) we see the type of argumentation that is (supposed to be) entirely non-linguistic,\nor, it is linguistic only to the extent that it uses language as a conventional, standard means of\ncommunication, as a \u201cmedium,\u201d which does not affect the \u201cmessage\u201d that it conveys.\nOf course, this spontaneous and common sense \u201ctheory\u201d is immediately confronted\nwith counter-examples. Let us assume (for the sake of the argument) that we are working on a\nseminar paper about frictions between Yugoslav nations in post-Titoist Yugoslavia, and that\nwe are especially interested in the war in Bosnia; we ask our friends working in the social\n2 That some linguistic entity is argumentatively oriented means that its presence in the given discourse segment\nimposes or represents some restriction(s) affecting the continuation of the discourse. In other words, even if the\nparticle only were followed by \u201ctwenty hours\u201d and not \u201can hour or so,\u201d the utterance would still be represented\nas leading to a negative conclusion. This, of course, challenges the \u201cfactuality\u201d of \u201cthe fact, that one hour of\nstudying is (usually) not enough to pass the exam.\u201d Namely, how many hours are enough to pass the exam,\nespecially if we take into account the restricting role of the particle \u201conly\u201d? More on this subject later in the text.\n31 sciences to refer us to somebody who might know something about our object of interest, and\nwe get the following two answers:\n(3) Janez did not read all the UN resolutions (Argument) >\nHe may not be able to advise you (Conclusion)\nand\n(4) Marko read some of the UN resolutions (Argument) >\nHe may be able to advise you (Conclusion).\nUtterances (3) and (4) display an obvious discrepancy between informative and\nargumentative values. The \u201cfact\u201d that Janez did not read all the UN resolutions could on the\n\u201cfactual,\u201d informative level also mean that he read all the UN resolutions except maybe one.\nAnd the \u201cfact\u201d that Marko read some of the UN resolutions could on the \u201cfactual,\u201d\ninformative level mean that he, perhaps, read only one or two. Janez could thus be an\nincomparably more suitable \u201cinformant\u201d than Marko, but language simply doesn't allow\nargumentative strings (3') and (4').\n(3') * Janez did not read all the UN resolutions (Argument) >\nHe may be able to advise you (Conclusion)\n(4') * Marko read some of the UN resolutions (Argument) >\nHe may not be able to advise you (Conclusion)\n32 In order to be able to remove asterisks from utterances (3') and (4') (i.e. make them\ndiscursively and argumentatively acceptable), we would have to bring in argumentatively\noriented modifiers, for example but nevertheless in (3') = (But nevertheless, he might be able\nto advise you), or only in (4') = (Marko read only some of the UN resolutions).\n1.2. To propose an argument, to demonstrate, to deduce\nWe said that it was language (as a system) that didn't permit argumentative strings (3')\nand (4'). What precisely does this mean?\nAbove all it means that to propose an argument is not to demonstrate or infer\nsomething in a logical manner, and that argumentation in general (and TAL in particular) is\nnot based on the rules of logical deduction.3 The mechanism to arrive at a conclusion in\nexamples (3) and (4) is not the same as the one involved in (5).\n(5) a.

Janez is a nationalist\nWhile example (5) represents a logically (deductively) supported conclusion, a\nsyllogism, where the conclusion c is a necessary consequence of the premises a and b, the\nconclusions in examples (3) and (4) are in no way necessary consequences of the arguments\nthat actually introduce them. Someone could use the utterance Janez did not read all the UN\nresolutions as an argument for a completely different conclusions, for example, Janez is a\n3 We are, of course, referring to the (so called) \u201cclassical,\u201d bivalent logic.\n33 very wise person, or Janez is an asshole, and these (conclusions) would, obviously, represent\ncompletely different argumentation frames from the one actually employed in argumentative\nstring (3). However, these hypothetical conclusions would be no less grounded or justified. In\ncontrast to (logical) demonstration or deduction, which is based on the laws of logic,\nargumentation in everyday life and conversation is based on (our) knowledge and judgment\nof the world, reality, and the concrete situation of the speaker and the addressee. And\nespecially on the assessment of the position that an utterance has (or can have) in a concrete\nsituation, and an assessment of (possible) conclusions an utterance-argument might lead to.\n1.3. Argumentative orientation\nAn argumentative relation (i.e., a relation between an utterance-argument and an\nutterance-conclusion) is thus completely different from a logical (deductive) relation (between\npremises and conclusion). A claim that is clearly supported by the \u201cfact\u201d that some\nconclusions, discursively completely acceptable, logically make no sense at all.\nLet us consider the following conversational fragment (which I borrowed from\nMoeschler (1985: 14)):\n(6) A: Is dinner ready by now?\nB: Yes, almost\nIn terms of (classical) logic, this dialogue makes no sense. Dinner can be either ready\nby now, or not ready yet. It can be almost ready, but this, logically taken, means that it is not\nready yet. Therefore, Yes, almost, is in no way a logically acceptable answer to the question Is\n34 dinner ready by now? because it would represent a contradictory utterance, namely: Yes,\ndinner is not yet ready.\nBy contrast, this dialogue is discursively, pragmatically completely acceptable, and it\nowes this acceptability \u2013 paradoxically as it may seem \u2013 exactly to the (problematical)\nparticle almost. The (utterance) Dinner is almost ready could be represented as an argument\nin favour of some implicit conclusion, such as, Hurry up! Such a conclusion is also supported\nby the (logically \u201cpurer\u201d) argument Dinner is ready (by now), the argument Dinner is ready\n(by now) being stronger (in view of the conclusion Hurry up!) than Dinner is almost ready -\nbut still with the same argumentative orientation. In other words, this means that on the\nargumentative scale of the \u201cdinner's readiness\u201d (if we constructed one)\n/dinner's readiness/\nthe argument Dinner is almost ready occurs as a weaker one, but it supports the same\nconclusion as does the strongest argument on the scale. An argumentative orientation must\nthus be, regardless of the context, inherent to the very particle almost, which means that every\nutterance-argument containing the particle almost represents a specific restriction affecting\nthe continuation of the discourse (i.e. utterance-conclusion): the utterance-conclusion\nfollowing it (i.e. following almost...) must argumentatively pursue and conform to the course\n35 mapped out, or delimited by the use of the particle almost, contained in the utterance-\nargument. In other words, from Dinner is almost ready it is impossible to conclude (in the\ndirection of) There is still time, you don't have to hurry (unless we preface it by a concessive\nbut, nevertheless...)\nThat explains, at least partially, why in the examples (3) and (4) we had to adopt the\nconclusions we had actually adopted. But let us step back for a moment, just to be able to see\nmore clearly what really was the problem (for Ducrot).\n1.4. Posited and presupposed\nExamples (3) and (4), which we used to demonstrate the difference between\ninformativeness and argumentativeness may seem rather illustrative, but they are certainly not\nthe most appropriate ones because they use two (lexically and semantically) different\nmorphemes: not \u2026 all and some. The difference between informativeness and\nargumentativeness becomes much clearer when we have to deal with (lexically and\nsemantically) synonymous morphemes, but with (very) different argumentative values.\nDucrot's favourite example is the difference between the French adverbs peu and un peu\n(which could be translated into English as little and a little). Informatively/factually, there\nseems to be no difference between the two: both of them denote a \u201csmall quantity\u201d of\nsomething. But argumentatively, if we use them in discourse, there is a rather big difference:\nlittle seems to be argumentatively oriented towards nothing, not at all, whereas a little seems\nto be argumentatively oriented towards a lot. How is that?\nLet us take a look at the following two examples:\n36 (7) Janez worked little. > He may not pass the exam.\n(8) Janez worked a little. > He may pass the exam.\nHere we have two examples that on the \u201cfactual,\u201d informational level, deal with the\nsame small quantities of something, but which argumentatively allow for very different\nconclusions. How can we explain that?\nIn his \u201cweak informativistic\u201d phase Ducrot tried to solve the problem by distinguishing\nbetween the posited and the presupposed in the utterance-argument. An utterance such as\n(9) Pre\u0161eren4 was a great poet\ncould thus be analyzed into what is (explicitly) posited:\n(p): Pre\u0161eren's poetry was extraordinary,\nand into what is (implicitly) presupposed:\n(pp): Pre\u0161eren was a poet.\nIn linguistics, it is often taken as a test for distinguishing what is posited from what is\npresupposed in a given utterance that the utterance's presupposition must not change if we\na) negate the utterance,\nb) put it into an interrogative form, or\n4 Pre\u0161eren is a nationally glorified poet in Slovenia.\n37 c) embed it in a subordinate clause.\nIf we apply these three criteria to our example (9), we can see that, in this respect, our\nanalysis was correct. Utterances\n(9') Pre\u0161eren wasn't a great poet\n(9'') Was Pre\u0161eren a great poet?\n(9''') Slovenians are convinced that Pre\u0161eren was a great poet,\nin principle retain the same presupposition: Pre\u0161eren was a poet. We have to say 'in principle',\nbecause the range of the negation in (9') could easily be the whole phrase great poet, and not\nonly the adjective great, which means that the presupposition (Pre\u0161eren was a poet) would be\nnegated too. That being the case, we could easily use (9') as an argument for a conclusion\nsuch as: He was an impostor, namely Pre\u0161eren wasn't a great poet (Argument), he was an\nimpostor (Conclusion).\nThat is why Ducrot introduced a new, stronger and decisive criterion for\ndistinguishing between what is posited and what is presupposed: an utterance-conclusion can\nonly be drawn from what is (explicitly) posited, but not from what is (implicitly) presupposed.\nOnly after applying this criterion can we be sure that our distinction between what is posited\nand what is presupposed in (9) was correct. From Pre\u0161eren was a great poet (Pre\u0161eren's\npoetry was extraordinary) we can easily conclude, We built him a monument, whereas the\npresupposition Pre\u0161eren was a poet doesn't allow for such a conclusion (at least not in\nSlovenia; which doesn't mean, of course, that there could not be a country where they build\nmonuments for every poet they have).\n38 This criterion is crucial for explaining and understanding the different argumentative\norientation of utterances (7) and (8). Utterance (7) could be analyzed into:\np: the quantity of Janez's work is small\npp: Janez worked\nand the utterance (8) into:\np: Janez worked\npp: the quantity of Janez's work is small.\nBy doing that, we retain the informative component of both utterances (the quantity of\nJanez's work is small), and explain their different argumentative orientations (and conclusions\nthat follow from them), but the problem of informativeness returns through the back door.\nHow and why?\nIt should be understandable by now that little is argumentatively oriented in the same\ndirection as nothing, not at all, and that a little is argumentatively oriented in the same\ndirection as a lot. To the effect that both Janez worked a little and Janez worked a lot could be\nput forward as arguments toward a conclusion He may pass the exam. And, mutatis mutandis,\nwe could say the same for Janez worked little and Janez didn't work at all, which could be put\nforward as arguments toward a conclusion He may not pass the exam. The difference is only\nin the force of the arguments, so that we can easily paraphrase and reinforce the argument\nJanez worked little by Janez worked little, even not at all, and the argument Janez worked a\nlittle by Janez worked a little, even a lot.\n39 But by doing that, we reestablish the discrepancy on the \u201cfactual\u201d, informative level:\nlittle is nevertheless something and not nothing, and a little is only a little and not a lot. It was\nthat very problem that forced Ducrot into constructing his \u201cweak version\u201d of the theory of\nargumentation in language.\n1.5. Argumentative scales\nAn important distinction that Ducrot introduces in this phase is the distinction between\na sentence (phrase) and an utterance (\u00e9nonc\u00e9) on the one hand, and meaning (signification)\nand sense (sens) on the other. Ducrot regards a sentence as a schematic, abstract construction,\nand thus as a matter of language (la langue) (in the Saussurean sense), and the utterance as its\nrespective realization, i.e. a matter of speech (la parole). This means that every utterance of\nthe same sentence is unique and always new. Therefore, there are no identical utterances even\nthough sequences of uttered sounds and words may appear identical. Each utterance is the\nresult of some concrete, individual act of uttering in a specific, constantly changing context\nthat has to be reconstructed for each and every interpretation.\nThe conceptual pair meaning/sense is related to the pair sentence/utterance: meaning is\nthe semantic value of a sentence, whereas sense is the semantic value of an utterance.\nHowever, Ducrot does not define (and this represents one of his innovations) the meaning (of\na sentence) as part of its sense (as is commonly done in the formula: \u201csense = meaning +\ncontext\u201d), but rather as a set of instructions that should help us in disentangling the sense of\nutterances that are (or could be) possible realizations of the given sentence. The sentence-\nmeaning thus guides our correct interpretation of an utterance, i.e. it guides our search for\ninformation, which must be, in order for our interpretation to be plausible, sought in the\ncontext. What does this mean? Let us go back to example (6):\n40 (6) A: Is dinner ready by now?\nB: Yes, almost.\nWe have already said that the utterance Dinner is almost ready provides an argument\nin favour of some implicit conclusion that is oriented in the direction of lateness, e.g. Hurry\nup! The same conclusion is also supported by the argument Dinner is ready by now, but the\nlatter is stronger (affirming that the dinner is ready, not just almost ready) than the former, yet\nboth of them have identical argumentative orientations.\nTo be able to interpret an utterance of Dinner is almost ready, the construction of a\nsentence meaning would therefore have to consist of\na) informative (descriptive) instruction(s)\nand\nb) argumentative instruction(s).\nConsequently, the utterances of the sentence Dinner is almost ready can be correctly\ninterpreted only if we follow the instructions for its (sentence) meaning as stated below:\ninformative instruction:\nsome small quantity of time \u00b5 has to be defined or agreed upon; the utterance is true if\ndinner is not yet ready, and if the time difference between the utterance Dinner is almost\nready and dinner's actual readiness equals \u00b5.\nargumentative instruction:\n41 some conclusion C has to be found, which can also be supported by the utterance\nDinner is ready by now, e.g. Hurry up!\nOur examples with little (7) and a little (8) could thus be interpreted as follows:\n(7) Janez worked little. > He may not succeed (in passing the exam).\ninformative instruction:\nsome quantity of work \u00b5 has to be defined or agreed upon, which can be regarded or\ncan still be regarded as small. Utterance (7) is true if Janez has not exceeded this quantity (of\nwork).\nargumentative instruction:\nsome conclusion C has to be found, which would also be supported by the (stronger)\nutterance Janez did not work (at all), e.g. He may not succeed (in passing the exam).\nUtterances (8) and (7) would thus share the informative, but not the argumentative instruction:\n(8) Janez worked a little. > He may succeed (in passing the exam).\ninformative instruction:\nsome quantity of work \u00b5 has to be defined or agreed upon, which can be regarded or\ncan still be regarded as small. Utterance (8) is true if Janez has not exceeded this quantity (of\nwork).\n42 argumentative instruction:\nsome conclusion C has to be found, which could also be supported by the argument\nJanez worked a lot, e.g. He may succeed (in passing the exam).\nWith this conceptual innovation Ducrot still bases argumentation on the informative\nand the \u201cfactual,\u201d but at the same time he enables the regulation of the informative with what\nis completely argumentative in language. The expression \u201cargumentation in the language-\nsystem\u201d points precisely to this, i.e. to the \u201cfact\u201d that the argumentative orientation is inherent\nto the language as a system (language as an abstract structure, as defined by de Saussure), and\nthat it is not (only) the result of the working of the context (on the contrary, it even\ncreates/presupposes its own basic context). Despite this compromising solution two things\nimmediately become obvious:\n1. Descriptive, informative instructions are not really important for the course of\nargumentation itself, i.e. for the transition from an argument to a conclusion. In other\nwords, the \u201cfactuality\u201d or the truth of an utterance-argument (its congruence with the\nstate of the so called \u201cobjective reality\u201d) is not decisive for the orientation of an\nargument, and it therefore becomes dominated by argumentative instructions.\n2. The nature of an argument seems to be scalar or gradual. Several arguments support\nthe same conclusion, but some of them (more) weakly than some others (almost ready,\nready by now). That is why Ducrot (sometimes) calls almost and some other\noperators/connectives/indicators (e.g. already and yet) argumentative variables. They\ndo belong to/act on the same argumentative scales, but they occupy/point to different\npositions on them.\n43 The dominance of argumentativeness over informativeness and the exposition of the\ngradual nature of arguments already provide all expedients for the transition into the latest,\n\u201cstrong version\u201d of the theory of argumentation in language, in which the fundamental\nconcepts are topoi and polyphony.\nTopoi\nThe transition into the strong theory of argumentation in the language-system\nrepresents a radical break with former phases of the theory, not only terminologically, but\nabove all conceptually. This break becomes evident from the two theoretical hypotheses\ncharacterizing this phase:\n1. The transition from A(rgument) to C(onclusion) is based on topoi, which are general,\ncommon (within a given community), and scalar structures of the type\nThe more P, the more Q\nor\nThe less P, the less Q\n2. Argumentative values of utterances take complete dominance over their informative\nvalues, whereas exclusively informative utterances acquire a linguistically marginal\nstatus.\n44 In the \u201cweak\u201d phase of argumentation in the language-system, argumentation is still\nbased on \u201cfacts,\u201d but it is controlled by argumentative instructions related to the meaning of\nthe sentence. In the \u201cstrong\u201d phase, however, the argumentative no longer simply controls the\ninformative, but supersedes it: the informative becomes not only entirely subordinated to the\nargumentative, it is even derived from it. If argumentation (i.e. argumentative orientation) is\n(at least to some extent) inherent to language, then utterances merely describing reality or\nreporting about it are linguistically marginal: they use language only as the medium of\ntransmission. Consequently, if argumentation is inherent to language, this medium can in no\nway be (argumentatively) neutral: argumentative variables (even accumulation or\njuxtaposition of variables if necessary) guide discourse in a quite specific direction,\nregardless of the representative or informative content conveyed in and by the discourse.\nIf we turn to Ducrot's conceptualization of topoi now, what does it mean that some\ntopos is a) general, b) common and c) scalar?\nIt means that it is a) a general (and, at the same time, very abstract) scheme or matrix allowing\na multitude of particular conclusions, which are not obligatory or binding in a way syllogism\nor logical deduction is. Topos (i.e. referring to a topos or applying it) can allow some\nconclusion, but it does not bind the speaker to that conclusion. Therefore, our addressee (and\nwith this we have arrived at b)) can recognize the validity or appropriateness of the topos\nemployed in our conclusion, without necessarily agreeing with it. He/she may find some other\ntopos more appropriate to the situation, and may use it to support a different conclusion\ninstead.\nThe assumption that topoi are common (within a specific community, ranging from\nsmall cultural or political sub-groups to the nation as a whole) only means that some\ncommunity recognizes their validity, or validity and justifiability of the conclusions based on\nthose topoi. It does not imply that every member of the community would necessarily use the\n45 same topoi in identical (or similar) situations. The application of some topos, or a conclusion\nstipulated by this topos, can always be refuted by applying some other topos to support a\ndifferent conclusion.\nIf we try to apply such conceptualization of topoi to our examples (7) and (8)\n(7) Janez worked little. > He may not succeed (in passing the exam)\n(8) Janez worked a little. > He may succeed (in passing the exam)\nwe can see that the argumentative string (7) applies or refers to some topos5 such as\nT1 The less we work, the smaller the likelihood of success,\nand that (7) applies this topos weakly. Whereas the argumentative string in (8) applies (also\nweakly) some topos such as\nT2 The more we work, the greater the likelihood of success.\nWhy do we say that argumentative strings (7) and (8) apply topoi T1 and T2 weakly?\nOr more precisely, how do we define \u201cweakly\u201d and its antipode \u201cstrongly\u201d? That is where\nDucrot's third concept, the concept of scalarity (c) comes in.\nDucrot initially defined \u201cstrongly\u201d and \u201cweakly\u201d as more or less heuristic devices:\n- to apply a topos strongly means that there are only few arguments that could be\nstronger than the one used;\n5 In other words, the argumentative string in question is constructed on a topos or, by the very transition from the\nargument to the conclusion (re)constructs a topos.\n46 - to apply a topos weakly means that there are only few arguments that could be weaker\nthan the one used.\nHowever, is it possible to define the values 'weak' and 'strong' in a conceptually more strict\nlinguistic manner?\nLet us assume, for the sake of the demonstration, that we operate with a two-part\nargument: let us label the first part of the argument A, and the second B. We shall say that in\nthis case the following two definitions apply:\n1. Argument A is stronger than B, if: \"B, and even A\" holds true.\n2. Argument A is weaker than B, if: \"B, and at best/at worst A\" holds true.\nNow we should test these definitions on two examples:\nA B\n(10) This is a cold, or at worst a flu. > Don't worry!\nA B\n(11) This is pneumonia, or at best a flu. > Take care!\nUtterance (10) obviously applies some topos such as:\nT3 The less we are ill, the less reason to worry\nand utterance (11)\n47 T4 The more we are ill, the more reason to worry.\nThe A arguments are, in the light of our definition, stronger than the B arguments,\nwhich means that, if the given conclusion proceeds from B, it must also proceed (and with\ngreater probability) from A. In other words, both utterances apply \u201ctheir\u201d topoi strongly. With\nregard to argumentative scales that could be constructed in accordance with our knowledge of\nthe force of arguments in both cases\n48 we can say that both utterances apply their topoi in the direction of argumentative scales;\ntherefore, they strive toward the stronger application of topoi.\nLet us now change the argumentative variables in (10) and (11). Instead of at best/at\nworst, we shall use even in (10') and (11'), which results in:\nA B\n(10') This is a cold, even a flu. > Take care!\nA B\n(11') *This is pneumonia, even a flu. > Take care!\nIn accordance with our (i.e. Ducrot's) definitions of the weak and strong application of\ntopoi, the introduction of the argumentative variable even changes (inverses) the force of the\n49 arguments (B is now represented as stronger than A), and with this also the argumentative\norientation itself! From the argument This is a cold, even a flu, we can no longer conclude\nDon't worry, but only Take care. Which entirely complies with the negative argumentative\nscale of worry (-) - as well as with our general knowledge of the world - where flu occupies a\nlower position than a cold, thus being closer to the cause of worry since the scale is negative.\nThat our claim about the decisive role (of the choice) of the argumentative variable is\nnot exaggerated is demonstrated by the \u201ctransformation\u201d of example (11). What happens to\nexample (11) after we change the variable? To a \u201cflu\u201d (which occupies a lower position than\npneumonia on the positive argumentative scale of worry (+)) the mere presence of even in the\nutterance, i.e. the argumentative orientation inherent to even, assigns the value of the stronger\nargument, thus leading to the conclusion Take care. Namely, the argumentative orientation\ninherent to even does not allow the argument following it to be weaker than the one preceding\nit; on the contrary, the argument introduced by even (i.e. the argument following the\n(argumentative) variable even), is represented as expected to enhance the force of the\npreceding argument. In \u017dagar (2010: 133-162), I described this mechanism triggered by\n(some) argumentative indicators (connectives, particles or operators) as creating certain\nargumentative expectation (and respective argumentative indicators as triggers of\nargumentative expectation).\nTherefore, if we want to avoid the application of some topos T3' The less we are ill,\nthe more reason to worry (which could be general, but hardly common), and thus recover the\nargumentative balance, we must introduce an additional argumentative variable in example\n(11'), for example:\n(11'') This is pneumonia, even only a flu. > Don't worry!\n50 or even (!)\n(11''') This is pneumonia, maybe even only a flu. > Don't worry!\nWe could say that if only mitigates and modifies the argumentative orientation of even,\nthen maybe (argumentatively) mitigates a potential logical disparity between coordinately\nrelated \"propositional elements\". Namely, if an illness is pneumonia, then it is not a flu, and\nvice versa; however, if we mitigate both assertions with maybe, we place them \"between the\nbrackets\" and outside the logical system where they can be either true or false.\nA few more words about conceptual bases of topoi. What really is a topos? How does\nit function? Topos functions as a warrant (in Toulmin's terms) authorizing the move from\nA(rgument) to C(onclusion) by indicating a link between two general properties, P and Q,\nconnected with A and C respectively. Let us take another one of Ducrot's favourite examples:\n(12) It's warm (Argument). Let's go for a walk (Conclusion).\nAccording to Ducrot, the topos that authorizes the move from A to C (in that particular case)\ncould be reconstructed as\nT5 The more it is warm, the more pleasant it is to go for a walk,\nand relates two qualities, P (\u201cthe warmth\u201d), connected to A, and Q (\u201cthe pleasantness of a\nwalk\u201d), connected to C.\nThese two qualities are gradual or scalar (i.e., could be represented as scales), which\nmeans that the more we go up one scale (P), the more we go up the other (Q): the more it is\n51 warm, the more pleasant it is to go for a walk. But is that true? Isn't there a point where the\nwarmth (an excessive warmth, for example) makes it unpleasant to go for a walk? Which\nmeans that from such a critical point the topos T5 couldn't be applied any more. Doesn't that\nmake it non-valid? Not necessarily (topoi are general, not universal), it just means that from a\ncertain point (yet) another topos (or even several topoi) may start to apply\nT6 The more it is warm, the less pleasant it is to go for a walk.\nor\nT7 The less it is warm, the more pleasant it is to go for a walk.\nWhich, again, doesn't (necessarily) mean that T5 doesn't apply any more (at all), it just\nmeans that from a certain point it stops to be generally and commonly shared by a certain\ncommunity, and another topos takes its place.\n1.7 Polyphony\nThe other crucial concept for Ducrot's strong version of argumentation in language is\npolyphony, a concept he borrowed from Bakhtin, and generalised to the language-system as a\nwhole.\nAs you already know, Bakhtin distinguishes between dialogism and polyphony.\n\u201cPolyphony\u201d, he says, in his Marxism and the Philosophy of Language6 (1973: 116), \u201cis\ndistinctly and fundamentally different from dialogue. In dialogue, the lines of the individual\n6 It is still disputed whether Marxism and Philosophy of Language was in fact writen by Bakhtin and only\nattributed to Voloshinov, or whether it was Voloshinov's original work.\n52 participants are grammatically disconnected: they are not integrated into one context.\u201d\nDialogues, therefore, are produced by two or more speakers, while polyphony is a\nmonological structure. He found examples of polyphonic structures (utterances) mostly in\nnovels, and in his book on Dostoevsky (1984: 304) he gives this (now famous) definition of\nthe polyphonic phenomenon:\n\u201cAn author may utilize the speech of another in pursuit of his own aims and in\nsuch a way as to impose a new intention on the utterance, which nevertheless\nretains his own proper referential intention. Under these circumstances and in\nkeeping with the author\u2019s purpose, such an utterance must be recognised as\noriginating from another addresser. Thus, within a single utterance, there may\noccur two intentions, two voices\u201d.\nSo, for Bakhtin, a polyphonic construction belongs to a single speaker, but actually\ncontains (mixed within it) \u201ctwo utterances, two speech manners, two styles, two languages,\ntwo semantic and axiological belief systems\u201d (1984: 304).\nBakhtin\u2019s study of polyphony was mostly confined to novels, while Ducrot\ngeneralised the phenomenon as far as language as a system. How does Ducrot define\npolyphony?\nDucrot thinks that what traditional linguistics refers to as a speaker is in fact a very\ncomplex (and confused) notion that covers a number of wholly different ideas. So he proposes\nthat we distinguish between a producer, a speaker and an utterer of an utterance.\nWho is the producer of an utterance? The producer of an utterance is the one whose\nactivity results in the production of an utterance, i.e. the producer is the one who carries out\n53 (at least) the intellectual activity necessary for the production of the utterance. That may seem\nvery obvious but there are cases where it becomes rather puzzling.\nThink of yourself as a pupil, for example (once more, I borrowed this example from\nDucrot): the school organizes a walk in the countryside and for you to be able to go on that\ntrip you must have your parents' permission. Your teacher therefore gives you a form for your\nmother/father to sign. So you bring to your mother/father a form that says something like: \u201cI\nallow my son/daughter to take part in the excursion\u201d, and at the bottom of the form there is a\nword \u201csignature.\u201d What your mother/father has to do is to put her/his signature under the\nword \u201csignature.\u201d Now, who is the producer of that form saying \u201cI allow my son/daughter \u2026\u201d?\nThe one who signed it? The teacher who gave it to you? The secretary who typed it? The\nprincipal who dictated it to her? The Ministry of Education that sent it to all the principals? It\nis hard to say (isn't it?). It seems that producer is a very unclear notion. That is why we need\nthe speaker and the utterer. The speaker would be the one who is responsible for the utterance,\nthe one who is held responsible for the utterance itself or, at least, responsible for the act of\nuttering the utterance.\nIn the case of our pupil and his/her mother/father, there is no problem: the utterance\ncontains a pronoun \u201cI\u201d that clearly points to the speaker (regardless of who actually produced\nit). But, what happens if the utterance contains no explicit devices such as pronouns? And\neven if they do, do we really have to hold the speaker responsible for everything that is said\n(and/or implied, conventionally or conversationally) in the utterance? Must everything that is\nsaid and/or heard in the utterance be taken as speaker's own point(s) of view?\nThat is where and why the utterers7 come in. According to Ducrot, there are several\nutterers or more correctly uttering positions within an utterance, which is another way of\nsaying that several different viewpoints may be expressed through one utterance. Ducrot's\n7 The term Ducrot and his French folowers use is \u00e9nonciateur(s). I think that utterer may be a better translation\nthan enunciator; we enunciate something on rather formal, solemn occasions, while we utter this and that all\nthe time in everyday conversation. And that is exactly how the term \u00e9nonciateur is used in Ducrot's theory.\n54 position is even more radical; according to him every utterance could be analyzed in at least\ntwo uttering positions. For example, let us take the utterance\n(13) This fence is not red.\nThe speaker of this utterance presents, roughly speaking, two utterers:\n- the first one (U1) who affirms that the fence is red, and\n- the second one (U2) opposing his/her affirmation.\nThe speaker, as the one who is responsible for the utterance, merges with U2.\nBut then, what makes it possible to proceed in this fashion? What gives us the right to\ndistinguish between several uttering positions within a single utterance? In the case of (13), for\nexample, the very fact that there are no fences that are non-red, non-yellow, and non-brown. Of\ncourse, a fence could be described as non-red, non-yellow, or non-brown, but such a description\nwouldn't give us any idea of the real colour of the fence. Therefore, if somebody is affirming\nthat, X is not... he must be objecting to somebody who is affirming the contrary, namely that, X\nis ... (which, of course, does not mean that affirmations cannot be polyphonic: when one says,\n\"This fence is red\", one could well be affirming something that someone else has denied).\nThis may be too \"ontological\" an argument, so let me give you another example, this\ntime from the philosophy of language. Some time ago (\u017dagar 1991a), I tried to analyse\nexplicit performatives in terms of polyphonic analysis. Namely, I thought that performative\nutterances like:\n(14) I promise.\n55 were extremely strange. You could of course object that such an isolated expression was taken\nout of the context, so let us examine the utterance (14) in one of its possible \"contextualised\"\nforms:\n(14\u2019) I promise to come.\nUnfortunately the utterance still seems very strange as well. I can hardly imagine someone\nsaying (14\u2019) just like that, out of the blue. Again, you could object - and with good reason - that\nthe utterance has been taken out of context, and that the locutor is probably responding to a\nquestion such as:\n(15) Are you coming?\nOK, now we have the minimal immediate context, but I still have a lot of trouble digesting\ndialogical linkages like:\n(16) A: Are you coming?\nB: I promise to come.\nPerhaps in some Greek tragedy, but not in everyday conversation. There is something not quite\nright; either there is too much of something, or else something is missing. What is my point,\nthen?\nThe most common answer to question (15) - if we remain in the affirmative register -\nwould undoubtedly be, either:\n56 (17) Yes\nor\n(14\u2019\u2019) I am coming,\nbut hardly (14\u2019). If we answer by (14\u2019) there is, in its relation to the question, a dissymmetry, a\nsurplus in our answer, a surplus which indicates that something may be missing in the\nconversation string. Let us compare the following two bits of conversation:\nI II\n(16\u2019) A: Are you coming? (16) A: Are you coming?\nB: I am coming. B: I promise to come.\nWhat is the difference between the two? In the first version, B gives a straightforward\nanswer to A's question, confirming his/her arrival. In the second version, B does not give a\nstraightforward answer to A's question, but performs an act of promise, thus solemnly obliging\nhim/herself to come. What does this (difference) mean?\nIf one observes more closely B's answer in the second version, one notices that B does\nnot answer A's question at all. A did not ask him/her to promise to come, but only whether s/he\nwas coming or not. It thus becomes obvious that in the second version, B is answering some\nother question, that B is reacting to some other (previous) intervention in the conversation, which\nis absent from the given fragment of conversation, but is interpretatively presupposed by the\npresence, by the very utterance (the very use) of the performative prefix.\nThe \"basic structure\" of the second version of the dialogue should have therefore been\npolylogical, and not only dialogical, something we could reconstruct as follows:\n57 (16\u2019\u2019) A: We are throwing a surprise party tomorrow evening. Are you\ncoming?\nB: Yes, I am.\nC: That would be a surprise! You never come!\nB: I promise to come.\nHowever, one cannot, of course, present the viewpoints of different discursively\nreconstructed and implicit utterers in the way I have just done it: as fully-fledged utterances, as if\nsomebody actually uttered them. They are just a reconstruction of the context. Consequently, it is\nnot possible to assign to the viewpoints of different implicit utterers, which have been\nreconstructed within an utterance, a status that is equal to the status of the explicit utterance,\nwhich was taken as the starting point of the analysis, because they are nothing but products of the\nsame analysis and therefore have only a theoretical status. The viewpoints of different utterers\nshould only be presented in terms of attitudes, positions and orientations, so that one could end\nup by analysing example (16\u2019\u2019) as having a locutor (speaker) and (at least?) three utterers:\n- U1 presents a fact F (the surprise party tomorrow evening), and words its presentation in the\nform of an invitation;\n- U2 recognises the presentation of U1 by accepting the invitation;\n- U3 doubts the sincerity of U2 and therefore presents its consent (the consent of U2) as doubtful;\n- U2 opposes U3 and confirms its consent by a solemn turn of phrase.\nOne of Ducrot's most famous analyses is the pragmatic use of the French adverb toujours\n(Cadiot, Ducrot, Nguyen & Vicher (1985)). Suppose we have an argumentative string like:\n58 (18) Allons au bistro. On y sera toujours au chaud.\nLet's go to a bistro. At least we'll be warm there.\u2019\nAccording to Ducrot, we can distinguish at least five utterers within (18):\n- U1 presents a fact F, in our case a property P (warmth) of the object O (bistro) - \"it is warm in\nthe bistro\" -, and presents that property as an advantage of the object O;\n- U2 uses that favourable property P as an argument for the conclusion C (C = \"Let's go to a\nbistro\");\n- U3 presents the property P as a merely weak advantage;\n- U4 points out that weakness (of the property P) as a weakness that takes away every\nargumentative value from the fact F - which results in rejecting the viewpoint of U2;\n- U5, on the other hand, thinks that property P, though a weak advantage, is still a possible\nargument for the conclusion C (\"It is a weak advantage, but it is nevertheless something\"),\nthus rejecting the viewpoint of U4.\nOne particle, five utterers, and a crucial question: is there a limit to the number of utterers\nwe can have within a single utterance or argumentative string? Ducrot's answer is: no, in\nprinciple there could be an unlimited number of utterers. My opinion is: we should be careful,\nand not multiply utterers beyond the point that the analysis (still) allows for. In the given\nexample, I don't see any justification for distinguishing between U3 and U4. Such a distinction\ncould only be made hypothetically, ideally; nevertheless, it is not supported by the given data.\nThe use of the particle toujours (at least) only tells us that the argument is weak (thus supporting\nthe viewpoint of U3), but there is no indication that the argument is considered so weak that it\n59 loses every argumentative value. In other words, if the polyphonic analysis is to be taken\nseriously (and as we saw, it can be a very useful tool for pragmatic analysis), we should stick to\nthe given empirical data, not to the could-be \"data\".\nWith that in mind, let us have another look at example (12):\n(12) It's warm (Argument). > But I'm tired (Conclusion),\na string used to answer, and reject, a suggestion for a walk.\nAccording to Ducrot (1996/2009), there are at least four utterers in that argumentative\nstring: U1 and U2 are related to, \"It's warm\" (argument), and U3 and U4 to, \"I'm tired\"\n(conclusion). U1 describes the weather by saying, \"It's warm\". \"It's warm\" is thus - don't forget\nthat somebody suggested a walk - represented as an argument in favour of a walk, and U1 is\nsupporting its argumentation by summoning a topos like:\nT8 The warmer it is, the more pleasant it is to go for a walk.\nThen another utterer, U2, comes in, and from U1's point of view concludes with the walk. U3,\nwhose voice can be heard in the segment \"I'm tired\", by the very fact of introducing his/her\n(counter)argument by but, agrees with T8, namely that in warm weather it is pleasant to go for a\nwalk. But s/he is building her/his (counter)argument on a different topos, a topos we could\nreconstruct like:\nT9 Less one's physical state is good, less pleasant it is to go for a walk.\n60 So, in giving \"I'm tired\" as an argument for not going for a walk, the physical state is being\nrepresented as a property making a walk unpleasant. And finally, Ducrot concludes his analysis,\nthere is a U4 who concludes from U3's point of view not to walk.\nIn \u017dagar (1997) I criticised such an analysis by saying: if U2 concludes something from\nU1's point of view, and U4 concludes something from U3's point of view, why do we need U2\nand U4 at all? They could have well made their conclusions by themselves. But, as I have\npointed out in relation to the example (16''), this is another attitude we have to avoid if we want\nto take the polyphonic analysis seriously (i.e. as a useful analytical tool): utterers aren't persons\nwho can listen to each other and make their own conclusions - utterers are really just different\nuttering positions, different points of view, distinguishable within a single argumentative string.\nUtterers aren't real beings that talk to each other; they are just theoretical (and analytical) entities\nthat help us reconstruct the course of argumentation. From that perspective, if we want to\naccount for all the viewpoints within a single argumentative string, for all the (implicit) nuances,\nwe do need U2 and U4 as well.\n61 References\nAnscombre, J.C. & O.

In order to understand why ethos plays a fundamental role in those text types it seems necessary to first\ndiscuss the very notions of rhetoric and argumentation. The main goal of rhetorical and/or argumentative texts is\npersuasion. For this reason it also has to be clarified how persuasion works in those text types. After that we will\nlook at the topic of ethos from various points of view: ethos beside pathos and logos as one of the key elements\nof rhetoric; Aristotle\u2019s classification of the constituents of ethos into phronesis, eunoia, and ar\u00e9t\u00e8; ethos seen\nalmost as a mask in the Jungian sense; the distinction between ethos as a discursive phenomenon and ethos as a\nprediscursive phenomenon; the role of topoi and doxa in the construction of ethos and finally the differentiation\nbetween rhetorical argumentation and linguistic argumentation, the latter of which being of particular interest for\nour applied analysis. In that final part we will eventually analyze a few exemplary morphosyntactic structures\nwhich in a way create the speaker\u2019s ethical portrait or, to put it differently, which discursively construct the\nspeaker\u2019s ethos. The speeches we will draw upon were delivered by Mussolini between 1921 and 1941.\nKey words: discursive strategy, persuasion, argumentation, rhetoric, ethos\n1. Introduction\nPersuasion8 is the objective both of rhetoric and argumentation. The overall goal of\npersuasion is to make the listener or interlocutor change or give up his or her attitude in\nfavour of the one represented by the sender (Breton 2008: 9; Danblon 2005: 13). The process\nof persuasion is multi-layered and occurs in a series of steps. The starting point and\nprerequisite for successful persuasion is the creation of a persuasive and/or convincing ethos\non the part of the sender at the beginning of the rhetorical/argumentative commitment. In\n8 In this study we treat persuasion as a synonym of conviction without discussing any possible semantic\ndifferences between the two concepts.\n64 order to see the question of the creation of ethos in a more comprehensive context, we should\nlike to first deal with the question concerning the possible differences between rhetoric and\nargumentation; second, with the phenomenon of persuasion; third, with the role of ethos in\nrhetorical and argumentative discourse; and fourth, with the multi-layered phenomenon of the\nlinguistic-discursive creation of ethos in rhetoric and argumentation. After the theoretical\nintroduction there will be an applied part to illustrate how the linguistic-discursive creation\nworks in concrete political speeches. The four speeches which will serve as corpus for our\nanalyses were given by Mussolini between 1921 and 1941. The first of them was delivered on\nApril 3rd 1921 during the inaugural ceremony at the first encounter of the Fasci dell\u2019Emilia e\ndella Romagna (Mussolini 1921: 239, footnote). The second speech was given at the Teatro\nSociale in Udine on September 20th 1922 on the occasion of the encounter of the Fasci\nFriulani di Combattimento (Mussolini 1922: 411, footnote). On September 18th 1938\nMussolini talked to the Triestines in the Piazza dell\u2019Unit\u00e0 of their city Trieste (Mussolini\n1938: 144, footnote). And with the last of the four speeches, which serve us as corpus here,\nMussolini addressed the hierarchies of the Roman Fascists at the Teatro Adriano in Rome on\nFebruary 23rd 1941 (Mussolini 1941: 49, footnote). The topics Mussolini dealt with in the\nquotations of these four speeches concern Fascist convictions, policies and ideological\nprinciples as we will see in part three.\nRhetoric and argumentation are occasionally used as synonyms, yet sometimes as\nquite distinct disciplines or approaches to discourse. We will have a quick glance at this\nambiguity from a historical point of view. Concerning the issue of persuasion we will briefly\nretrace the etymological path of the term and then try to grasp the very nature of the\nphenomenon. The question of the nature of ethos on the one hand and the function of ethos in\ndiscourse on the other hand is our third topic. As is commonly known, the concepts of ethos,\npathos and logos stem from one of Aristotle\u2019s magna opera Rhetoric (Aristoteles 2010) from\n65 the fourth century B.C. in which rhetoric is treated as \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7, t\u00e9chn\u0113, which means art. This\nsuggests that Aristotle already conceptualised the emergence of ethos in discourse as the\nresult of an artful strategy. When talking about ethos nowadays it has to be verified whether it\nstill and always stands for what Aristotle understood by it. If, however, we follow Aristotle\u2019s\nconcept of ethos, which we will do, it will be interesting to find out how ethos comes about in\ndiscourse in general and in political speeches in particular and this is what we will analyse in\nthe applied part of this brief study.\n2.1 Argumentation vs. rhetoric\nOne of the more recent definitions of argumentation which has almost become a\nmodern classic at least in the francophone world is the one by Anscombre/Ducrot (31997)\naccording to which a speaker argues for or against something when he or she makes an\nutterance or various utterances which are meant to admit another one.9 The resulting chains or\nargumentative concatenations become an essential means for creating coherence (Ducrot,\n1995: 85; Maingueneau 1991: 228) and coherence as well as cohesion as fundamental textual\ncriteria are indispensable for successful argumentation. The overall pragmatic goal of\nargumentation, however, for which the textual criteria of coherence and cohesion are\nprerequisites, is making the addressee or listener adopt a conclusion which originally was not\nhis or hers (Danblon 2002: 13). What is important is that the sender skilfully presents one,\ntwo or more premises which ideally make the addressee draw his or her own conclusions. In\nthis case it is not the sender who directly suggests or tries to impose his or her own\nconclusions but he or she manages to make the addressee come to the conclusion which has\nbeen the sender\u2019s from the beginning. What is more, it is not only the specific premises that\nmake for the respective conclusion. In one way or another it is the whole text which\n9 \u201cUn locuteur fait une argumentation lorsqu\u2019il pr\u00e9sente un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 E1 (ou un ensemble d\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9s) comme\ndestin\u00e9 \u00e0 en faire admettre un autre (ou un ensemble d\u2019autres) E2. Notre th\u00e8se est qu\u2019il y a dans la langue des\ncontraintes r\u00e9gissant cette pr\u00e9sentation.\u201d (Anscombre/Ducrot 31997: 8)\n66 contributes to the resulting conclusions (Vignaux 2004: 113) as it shapes concepts and\nattributes specific meanings to words, syntagmas and textual building blocks, the intrinsic\nsemantic content of isolated words being minimal. However, usually the textual surface is not\ncomplete which means that either one or more of the premises or the conclusion are not\nexplicated. Aristotle himself pointed out that common premises and shared knowledge should\nnot be explicitly stated (Amossy 22006: 164). What is left implicit, however, is far from being\na textual blank without any function (Maingueneau 1991: 234). On the contrary, it is the\naddressee\u2019s task to activate his or her knowledge to make the seemingly fragmentary\nargumentation coherent and complete. Upon adding the missing links and thereby completing\nthe argumentation structure, the addressee adopts a highly creative role (Eco 1983: 50 ff.).\nWhen doing that, he or she even becomes the co-author of the argumentation at stake\n(Maingueneau 2002: 40; Walton 2007: 186) which considerably contributes to the process of\npersuasion. As co-author the addressee is much more likely to fully identify with the\nindirectly suggested conclusion.\nArgumentation is usually seen as opposed to demonstration (Boniolo/Vidali 2011: 7;\nMaingueneau 1991: 228). Demonstration, based on true premises, is part of formal logic\nwhereas argumentation, based on probable and plausible premises, is the analogon in\ninformal logic. What is relevant in discourse analysis, text linguistics and mainly in linguistic\npragmatics is obviously argumentation rather than demonstration, where implicit premises,\ndifferent kinds of implicatures, presuppositions and various kinds of inferential processes are\nat stake. The question which now arises is the one concerning the relationship between\nargumentation as informal logic and rhetoric. Ducrot understands by argumentation\nrh\u00e9torique (Ducrot 2004: 18) the verbal activity of making somebody believe something.\nMaking somebody believe something seems to be the overall goal of rhetoric as well as of\nargumentation. Cha\u00efm Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, who have written history in\n67 argumentation theory with their Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019argumentation, don\u2019t distinguish between rhetoric\nand argumentation as the subtitle of their work La Nouvelle Rh\u00e9torique (Perelman/Olbrechts-\nTyteca 1992) suggests. Interestingly enough though, this was also Aristotle\u2019s concept as in his\nwork the terms rhetoric and argumentation, to which he still referred as rhetoric and\ndialectics, were interchangeable as well (Amossy 22006: 4; Meyer 2008: 12).\nAt any rate, even if certain differences between argumentation and rhetoric have\noccasionally been worked out, the concept of ethos has turned out to be equally important\nboth for argumentation and rhetoric. It has for example been argued that in argumentation the\nlanguage is at the centre of interest, whereas in rhetoric it is man himself. It has been claimed\nthat argumentation tackles questions, whereas rhetoric tries to avoid them. Argumentation has\nbeen seen more closely related to reason, whereas rhetoric has even been treated as a\ndiscourse figure (Meyer 2008: 11 ff.; Breton/Gauthier 2000: 38). However, to conclude this\nshort and panoramic overview we would like to recall Meyer\u2019s metaphorical and quite\nexpressive definition of rhetoric according to which rhetoric is the negotiation of the distance\nbetween individuals concerning a question (Meyer 2008: 11).10 When taking this into account,\nit is perfectly coherent to consider argumentation as part of rhetoric as the overall goal of\nargumentation is also to reduce the distance between individuals concerning a question\n(Meyer 2008: 16). No matter whether rhetoric and argumentation are considered different,\nsimilar or the same domains, ethos is a key factor for both of them, and as a matter of fact it\nconstitutes the starting point for argumentative and/or rhetorical strategies. However, before\ndealing with the very issue of ethos, its nature and its function, we will briefly touch upon the\nmatter of persuasion as the main objective of argumentative and/or rhetorical strategies.\n2.2 The question of persuasion\n10 \u201cLa rh\u00e9torique est la n\u00e9gociation de la distance entre les individus \u00e0 propos d\u2019une question\u201d (Meyer 2008: 11).\n68 Persuade derives from Latin PERSUADERE, PER indicating the accomplishment of\nsomething and SUADERE, SUASUS from Sanskrit SVADUS, to instigate someone to do something\n(cf. TLIO; Pianigiani). Persuasion as opposed to orders or proposals operates indirectly, as the\naddressee is not explicitly asked to do or to believe something (Maingueneau 1991: 228). It is\nthe addressee himself or herself who draws the respective conclusions without mostly\nrealizing that he or she has been prepared to do so by being familiarized with the premises\nleading him or her to draw that conclusion. However, it is not only the premises leading to a\ncertain conclusion which constitute the persuasive part of a text. Every word as part of an\nutterance is argumentative as every utterance instigates the addressee to see, believe and act\ndifferently than before being addressed (Plantin 1996). The addressee integrates the new piece\nof information into his or her stock of information and then interrelates it with other pieces of\npertinent information and thus eventually gains new insights. Hence, merely by being\ninformed of no matter what, the addressee\u2019s cognitive state changes. Some new information is\nadded, some old belief is cancelled, or some existing attitudes are modified and all of this\nbrings about a change in the addressee\u2019s cognitive state.11 Perception is selective and the\ntransmission of information is necessarily selective as well. For this simple reason every\nspeech act is latently or potentially persuasive. It is only persuasive though, if the information\nis intentionally transmitted for the sake of bringing about a change in the addressee\u2019s attitude.\nOtherwise we\u2019d rather speak of unconscious influence. In practice it is obviously difficult to\nclearly separate one from the other as this kind of unconscious influence can serve as an ideal\nmask for manipulation without the sending manipulator having to assume any responsibility\nfor what he or she is saying and thereby suggesting. We have already described the objective\nof persuasion as such that the addressee should give up his or her own point of view in favour\nof the sender\u2019s. As to the nature of persuasion we have pointed out that not only\n11 In Relevance Theory these are the so-called positive cognitive effects (cf. Sperber/Wilson 1986)\n69 argumentative structures consisting of premises and conclusions are inherently persuasive but\nthat any speech act potentially contributes to it. What is at the heart of persuasion according to\nDanblon (2006: 145) is the strategy of doing as if things were evident when they are not at all.\nWhenever something is presented as obvious, it turns out to be difficult to question, let alone\nrefuse it. The creation of a credible and reliable ethos of the sender is indispensable to achieve\npersuasion based right on that premise within the framework of rhetoric and argumentation. In\nthe following paragraph we would like to develop that idea a little further.\n2.3 The role of ethos in rhetoric and argumentation\nAristotle distinguished between three modes of persuasion which are pathos, logos and\nethos. Nowadays one tends to overlook that to his mind the three devices were equally\nimportant. Pathos refers to the emotional state of the audience which the speaker has to strive\nfor in order to make the listeners receptive and sensitive to his or her concerns. Logos is the\ncapacity of reasoning put into practice in argumentative discourse mainly in the form of\nenthymemes and examples. As far as ethos is concerned, it is often translated as the speaker\u2019s\ncharacter (Danblon 2002: 69 ff; 2005: 34 ff.). The speaker\u2019s character or personality has to be\ntrustworthy and reliable otherwise the addressee won\u2019t follow his or her argumentation line.\nGroarke/Tindale (32004: 359) point out the importance of ethos for practical reasons when\nsaying that \u201cethotic considerations often play an important role in reasoning. They can arise in\ncircumstances in which we do not have the time, the means or the ability to investigate a\nquestion in sufficient detail to decide the proper answer to it.\u201d In other words, the addressee\nfollows the sender out of confidence. According to the principle of eth\u00e8 in antique rhetoric the\norator attributed a number of positive characteristics to himself in order to make his\npersonality appear pleasant and trustworthy. As to the variety of desirable characteristics to be\nstriven for, Aristotle himself made up a typology in which he distinguished between phronesis,\n70 practical wisdom, eunoia, benevolence (or goodwill, cf. \u017dmavc 2012: 183), and ar\u00e9t\u00e8, virtue\n(Maingueneau 1991: 183).12 However, according to Aristotle the discursive construction of\nethos does not happen explicitly by the orator\u2019s speaking about himself or by the author\u2019s\npraising his own virtue but it is built up implicitly by the speaker\u2019s way of giving the speech\n(Maingueneau 1987: 31). The orator thereby elaborates a kind of mask which is socially\nacceptable and even desirable, a mask almost in the Jungian sense (Jung 1964: 311 ff.).\nHowever, ethos has also had a different meaning ever since Greek antiquity. For the Greek\nphilosopher Isocrates as well as later on for the Roman philosophers Quintilian and Cicero for\nexample, ethos was not to be made up discursively, it was not supposed to be a linguistic\nmask, but it should reflect the orator\u2019s truly virtuous personality (Amossy 1999: 19). To do\njustice to the concepts of both, Aristotle and Isocrates, Amossy distinguishes between\ndiscursive ethos and prediscursive ethos, ethos discursif versus ethos pr\u00e9discursif or ethos\npr\u00e9alable (Amossy 22006: 79), the former referring to the constructed ethical picture arising\nfrom discourse, the latter referring to the speaker\u2019s true personality. Anyways, ethos is usually\nseen as a \u201cmultifaceted rhetorical concept\u201d (\u017dmavc 2012: 181), especially when dealt with\nfrom a historical perspective. \u017dmavc (2012: 184-185) distinguishes between three ancient\ntraditions of rhetorical ethos: In the first conception which stems from Plato and Isocrates\nethos discloses the speaker\u2019s moral character, \u201cwhich pre-exists discourse and should be\nreflected in the discourse.\u201d The second conception of rhetorical ethos derives from sophistic\nand textbook rhetoric. It is about practical examples and rules which are used and observed,\nrespectively for the construction of speeches, often in connection with argumentative\nstrategies which is typical of various sophists. The third conception of rhetorical ethos would\nbe the merging of the \u201cGreek rhetorical system\u201d and the \u201cRoman traditional oratory.\u201d\nHowever, maybe in order to simplify the rather complex conceptions of rhetorical ethos,\n12 \u017dmavc (2012: 183) points out, though that these notions are not Aristotle\u2019s but can be traced back even to\nHomer\u2019s Iliad.\n71 \u017dmavc (2012: 187) argues that generally speaking Greek rhetoric can be seen as a rhetoric of\nquarrel, whereas especially early Roman rhetoric used to be a rhetoric of consensus.\nIn any case, when we talk about the role of ethos in discourse nowadays, it still refers\nto the orator\u2019s personality which arises from his or her way of speaking (Maingueneau 2002:\n79) and not from \u201cextra-discursive\u201d knowledge the audience has about the orator\n(Maingueneau 1999: 75). Orators have addressed audiences at all times and in all places.\nConsequently ethos cannot possibly be understood as one fixed set of traits which can be\ndemonstrated and sold to any audience at any time in order to gain its confidence. The\nconcept of ethos doesn\u2019t have anything to do with permanent and timeless values. On the\ncontrary, it depends on ideology, religion, culture, current philosophical trends, the zeitgeist\nas well as the respective historical epoch. For this reason a very pragmatic and practical\nquestion has to be answered, namely which kind of ethos should be elaborated in the concrete\nspeech. The orator\u2019s first main goal being to please the listeners in order to conquer them\nemotionally, which is indispensable for persuading them of his or her ideas in the course of\nargumentation, the central guideline for the elaboration of ethos can be seen in doxa, which\nagain depends on all the variables listed above. For Aristotle the term doxa designated the\nopinion of all, of the majority or of competent and wise men (Amossy 2002a: 11). Seen in a\nsomewhat simplified or even reduced way doxa can therefore be understood as common\nopinion (Maingueneau 1991: 233). The specific contents of the thus displayed common\nopinion are facts, truths, assumptions, and values (Maingueneau 1991: 232;\nPerelman/Olbrechts-Tyteca 51992) which constitute the respective culture- and time-\ndependent topoi. As opposed to Aristotle\u2019s and Perelman/Olbrecht-Tyteca\u2019s concept of topoi\nas empty schemes which allow the concatenation of utterances, topos is here to be understood\nas pragmatic topos which can be equated with commonplace (Amossy 2002a: 15 ff.; 2002b:\n166 ff.). To cut a long story short, the pragmatic topoi as the backbone of doxa constitute the\n72 common basis of shared values for sender and addressee from which the sender can very well\nstart his or her argumentation.\nA final distinction between rhetorical argumentation and linguistic argumentation\nseems useful for our purpose. Ducrot generally understands by rhetorical argumentation the\nverbal activity which aims to make somebody believe something whereas linguistic\nargumentation refers to the different means of linguistically connecting propositions (Ducrot\n2004: 18). The concrete linguistic issues which are of interest under the aspect of linguistic\nargumentation are for example the functions of the different syntactic structures such as\nquestion and negation, the function of adverbs of quantity, the role of interjections and, first\nand foremost, the function of the different syntactic connectors (Maingueneau 1991: 234 ff.).\nWhen going back to ethos now, we would like to recall that it comes about procedurally\n(Amossy 22006: 71) as a result of linguistic-discursive construction and this is what we would\nlike to have a closer look at next on the basis of various speeches delivered by Mussolini.\n3. The linguistic-discursive creation of the speaker\u2019s ethos\nIn the following section, which is the applied part of the study, we will analyse six\nexemplary quotations from speeches given by Mussolini. Each of them will first be discussed\nunder the aspect of the morphosyntactic criteria which in our opinion make for the\nconstruction of ethos. After that we will think about how that particular linguistic structure\ncontributes to the improvement of ethos, provided ethos is understood as the result of a\nlinguistic-discursive construction, which is obviously the case here.\nIn the first example we are shedding light on the function of morphosyntactic zero-\nrealizations of arguments. It says\n73 (I) I popoli diventano grandi osando, rischiando, soffrendo, non mettendosi ai margini\ndella strada in una attesa parassitaria e vile. (Mussolini 1941: 57)\nPeoples become great through daring, risking, suffering, and not standing on the\nroadside in parasitic and vile expectancy\nOn the level of semantic valence it is obvious that the verbal functors osare, rischiare,\nsoffrire, i.e. dare, risk and suffer take more than one argument as one always dares do\nsomething, risks something and suffers something or from something. However, when used\ngenerically, the materially realized verbs osare, rischiare, soffrire do not necessarily require\nanother actant (Danler 2007). This means that the speaker doesn\u2019t have to explicitly state what\npeoples have to dare, risk and suffer to become great. If in that speech the speaker had\nexplicitly said that he expected his people to dare kill others, to risk their lives for him and his\npolicy and to suffer the deprivations of a war he himself was in favor of, he would have\nexplicitly created a different image or ethos of himself. If he had done so, the speaker would\nprobably have been reproached with selfishness, ruthlessness and irresponsibility. For this\nreason it was wise of him to use the verbs dare, risk and suffer generically without actantially\nspecifying the second arguments.\nIn the second passage we see in a certain sense the opposite of the first example. In this\ncase an argument wouldn\u2019t have to be morphosyntactically realized to fulfill the criterion of\nthe well-formedness of the sentence and yet it is:\n(II) Noi non facciamo della violenza una scuola, un sistema o, peggio ancora, una\nestetica. Noi siamo violenti tutte le volte che \u00e8 necessario esserlo. Ma vi dico subito che\n74 bisogna conservare alla violenza necessaria del fascismo una linea, uno stile nettamente\naristocratico o, se meglio vi piace, nettamente chirurgico. (Mussolini 1921: 241)\nWe (ourselves) don\u2019t make a school out of violence, a system or, even worse, some kind\nof aesthetics. We (ourselves) are violent any time it is necessary to be so. But let me tell\nyou right now: it is indispensable to stick to a line, a clear, aristocratic style or, if you\nprefer, a clear, surgical line, for the violence necessary for fascism.\nIn Italian as in the other Romance languages which are pro-drop languages the\nfirst argument of the verb doesn\u2019t have to be realized if the referent can be gathered\nfrom the context which is the case in quotation number II. The unmarked and neutral\nrealization would be non facciamo della violenza una scuola and siamo violenti tutte le\nvolte che \u00e8 necessario, we don\u2019t make \u2026 we are violent, without realizing the first\nargument of fare/to make and essere/to be which in this case is the first person plural\nnoi/we. By morphologically realizing it Mussolini skillfully starts his argumentation\nfrom a supposed preliminary agreement with the audience which he even points out by\nthe marked realization of the first argument. It is as if he acted and spoke in the name of\nthe audience. The preliminary agreement won\u2019t even be questioned as it is not the topic\nof the discussion and Mussolini will therefore get away with it. What is more, when\nsaying we (ourselves) don\u2019t make a school out of violence, it is as if his spontaneous and\nnatural reaction to violence were negative. The morphosyntactic negation entails a\nnegative orientation. The resulting peace-loving image remains to a certain extent even\nthough he afterwards says point-blank we (ourselves) are violent any time it is\nnecessary to be so. Concerning the creation of ethos it is as if the speaker identified\n75 himself with the audience and as if he were speaking in their name. He portrays himself\nas a non-violent person in principle, full of sympathy and empathy.\nIn number III Mussolini uses a passive construction which allows him not to\nspecify the agent:\n(III) La disciplina deve essere accettata. Quando non \u00e8 accettata, deve essere imposta.\nNoi respingiamo il dogma democratico che si debba procedere eternamente per sermoni,\nper prediche e predicozzi di natura pi\u00f9 o meno liberale. (Mussolini 1922: 413)\nDiscipline has to be accepted. When it is not accepted, it has to be imposed. We reject\nthe democratic dogma according to which one must eternally proceed by means of\nsermonizing, preaching and lectures of the more or less liberal kind.\nThe direct object of the corresponding active structure turns into the subject of the\npassive construction after the passive transformation whereas its subject turns into the\nagentive case which need not be specified syntactically any longer. By not having to\nexplicitly state who would have to accept discipline and by whom it would otherwise be\nimposed, Mussolini appears much more harmless, responsible and maybe even paternal\nthan if he said I will impose and enforce discipline and you\u2019d better accept it. It is\nobviously only thanks to this morphosyntactic construction that the audience doesn\u2019t\nfeel intimidated and threatened by the speaker. The speaker\u2019s ethos thus remains free of\nauthoritarian or totalitarian claim despite the fact that certain democratic principles are\neven ridiculed.\nIn the excerpt number IV we see a passive construction with agent. Yet, as we have just\npointed out, in the passive construction the realization of the agentive case is not required for\n76 the morphosyntactic well-formedness. From the functional sentence perspective this means\nthat once it is realized, it has acquired special communicative weight, though. The reason for\nthat is the fact that anything that goes beyond the realization of the minimal argumentative\nstructure is syntactically superfluous but precisely because of that communicatively even\nmore important.\n(IV) Le privazioni, le sofferenze, i sacrifiz\u00ee che dalla quasi unanimit\u00e0 degli italiani e\ndelle italiane vengono affrontati con coraggio e con dignit\u00e0 che pu\u00f2 dirsi veramente\nesemplare, avranno il loro compenso [...]. (Mussolini 1941: 58)\nThe deprivation, the sufferings, the sacrifices, which are faced by almost all Italians\nwith courage and dignity, which can be described as exemplary, will have their\ncompensation [...].\nThe Italians who suffer the deprivations of war with courage and dignity are portrayed\nas heroes by Mussolini. This should prove his respect for them as well as his ethical integrity\nbut it should also put pressure on the audience to follow him in his policy. Respect and moral\nintegrity are the new facets of the speaker\u2019s ethos.\nIn quotation number V it is a diathetical change from causative to recessive or anti-causative\nthat allows the speaker to appear less aggressive and dangerous than he probably is:\n(V) Un milione e 850.000 elettori misero nell\u2019urna la scheda con la falce ed il martello:\n156 deputati alla Camera. Pareva imminente la catastrofe. [\u2026] Io, tutto orgoglioso dei\nmiei quattromila voti, e chi mi ha visto in quei giorni sa con quanta disinvoltura\naccettassi questo responso elettorale, dissi: la battaglia continua! (Mussolini 1921: 241)\n77 One million and 850,000 electors put the ballot paper with the sickle and the hammer\ninto the ballot box: 156 delegates to the Chamber. The catastrophe seemed imminent.\n[\u2026] I myself, all proud of my 4,000 votes, and whoever saw me in those days knows\nwith how much composure I accepted that electoral verdict, and I said: the battle\ncontinues!\nThe verb continuare/continue can be used either as a causative verb as in Peter\ncontinues the argument or as a recessive or anti-causative verb as in The argument (between\nthe two of them) continues. By resorting to the anti-causative version it is again possible to\nkeep the agent secret. So The battle continues once more appears to be less aggressive and\nless dangerous than We continue to fight and thereby Mussolini is more likely to get the\npeople\u2019s support than by showing his fanaticism and preference for fighting. Peacefulness and\nresponsibility for the country should characterize the speaker\u2019s ethos.\nAnother particularity of the Italian language but also of other Romance languages is the\nSI-diathesis which implies a different way of looking at a given constellation of actants and\ncircumstantials. When we say in English you know or one knows or even we know in order to\ndepersonalize an action or a process, in Italian we would say si sa which is impersonal, si just\nbeing some kind of clitic tag. The other SI-diathesis is the passivizing one like in si fanno\ndelle guerre/wars are waged, where le guerre/wars becomes the subject. Number VI\nillustrates the pragmatic consequence of the use the SI-diathesis:\n(VI) [\u2026] gli ebrei di cittadinanza italiana, i quali abbiano indiscutibili meriti militari o\ncivili nei confronti dell\u2019Italia e del regime, troveranno comprensione e giustizia; quanto\nagli altri, si seguir\u00e0 nei loro confronti una politica di separazione. Alla fine il mondo\n78 dovr\u00e0 forse stupirsi pi\u00f9 della nostra generosit\u00e0 che del nostro rigore [\u2026]; (Mussolini\n1938: 146)\n[\u2026] the Jews of Italian citizenship, who have undeniable military or civil merits for\nItaly and the regime, will find comprehension and justice; as for the others, a policy of\nseparation will be pursued. At the end, the world will perhaps be more surprised by our\ngenerosity than by our rigor [\u2026];\nMussolini says that a policy of segregation will be pursued. Due to the\nmorphosyntactic structure, it seems as if he didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. As if that\nwasn\u2019t hypocritical enough, he claims that the world will be surprised at his or their\ngenerosity. Again, Mussolini seems understanding, well-meaning and responsible and\nall that makes for the speaker\u2019s ethos which makes him appear a blameless, caring and\nsympathetic political leading figure.\n4. Concluding remark\nDue to skilfully used morphosyntactic constructions such as the zero-realization of\narguments (I), the specification of syntactically unnecessary actants (II), the passive voice\n(III), the marked use of syntactically unnecessary circumstantials (IV), the recessive rather\nthan the causative diathesis (V) as well as the use of the SI-diathesis (VI) allow the speaker to\nbuild up an extremely favourable ethos of himself. From these few quotations Mussolini\nemerges as disinterested and altruistic (I), non-violent, sympathetic and empathetic (II),\npolitically farsighted (III), full of respect and integrity (IV), peaceful and responsible (V),\nunderstanding, well-meaning and caring (VI). According to the doxa of those times and under\n79 the circumstances of those days the portrait of the speaker which arose from his speeches,\nwhich is in other words the linguistic-discursively constructed ethos, was by all means\npositive. On the basis of this positive ethos as a first implicit premise the speaker has a\npromising starting point for his argumentation.\nReferences:\nAmossy, R. \u201cLa notion d\u2019ethos de la rh\u00e9torique \u00e0 l\u2019analyse de discours.\u201d Images de soi dans\nle discours.

Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje\nSummary\nThis paper analyses the argumentative aspects of the Sokal affair, a publishing hoax performed by Alan Sokal in\n1996 when he successfully submitted a parodic, nonsensical paper masquerading as a highly scientific article to\nthe academic journal Social Text. The analysis presented here of Sokal\u2019s hoax is carried out within the\nframework of a more comprehensive research project related to subversion in argumentative discourse and\ndifferent strategies for tackling such subversion. The main point of this paper is to propose that the\nargumentative use of parody of Sokal\u2019s type can be seen as an instance of a strategy of \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d,\nthe goal of which is to ridicule the intellectually abusive participants in rational communication and make them\nfeel for themselves the negative and destructive effects of the subversion of intellectual standards. However, this\npaper will also show that the conditions for the successful application of this strategy are highly specific and that,\nunder particular circumstances, such a strategy can easily turn against its own users.\nKey words: Sokal affair, \u2018science wars\u2019, parody, subversion in argumentative discourse,\nargumentative strategies\nIntroduction: the origin of the Sokal affair\nIn 1996, Alan Sokal, a professor of physics at New York University, published an\narticle in the special spring/summer issue of the journal Social Text (no. 46/47). This highly\nreputed academic journal of \u201cpostmodern cultural studies\u201d devoted the special issue in\nquestion to the phenomenon of the \u201cscience wars\u201d. The expression \u201cscience wars\u201d referred to\nintellectual exchanges taking place in American academic circles in the 1990s, focusing on\n13 The author would like to thank \u017darko Trajanoski for first turning her attention to the Sokal affair, as well as\nthe participants of the \u201cDays of Ivo \u0160kari\u0107\u201d conference held in Postira in Croatia (19\u201322 April, 2012) for their\nintellectually stimulating discussions and questions, and the editors of this volume and the reviewers of the first\nversion of this article for their valuable comments and suggestions.\n84 questions about the nature of science, scientific methodology and scientific knowledge. The\nmain \u201cwar camps\u201d in this intellectual confrontation were represented on one side by adherents\nof scientific realism and on the other by their postmodernist critics.\nIn one of the opening paragraphs of Sokal\u2019s article, entitled \u201cTransgressing the\nBoundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity\u201d, Sokal stated the\nfollowing:\nIt has thus become increasingly apparent that physical \u201creality\u201d, no less than social\n\u201creality\u201d, is at bottom a social and linguistic construct; that scientific \u201cknowledge\u201d, far\nfrom being objective, reflects and encodes the dominant ideologies and power\nrelations of the culture that produced it; that the truth claims of science are inherently\ntheory-laden and self-referential; and consequently, that the discourse of the scientific\ncommunity, for all its undeniable value, cannot assert a privileged epistemological\nstatus with respect to counter-hegemonic narratives emanating from dissident or\nmarginalized communities. (Sokal, 1996; reprinted in the annotated version in Sokal,\n2010: 9)\nBy arguing in favour of the thesis that social and physical \u201creality\u201d, together with\npurported objective knowledge of that reality, is in fact a social and linguistic construct\ndependent on the power relations prevailing in the framework of the culture which produces\nthat construct, Sokal apparently allied himself with postmodernist critics of the concept of\nscientific objectivity.\nIn an article for Lingua Franca of May\u2013June 1996, however, Sokal revealed that the\npaper published in Social Text, \u2018Transgressing the Boundaries\u2026\u2019, was actually a hoax\u2014a\nparody whose purpose was \u201cto test the prevailing intellectual standards\u201d in \u201ccertain precincts\n85 of the American academic humanities\u201d (Sokal, 1996a). Concerned by an apparent decline in\nstandards of intellectual rigour in these areas of education and research, Sokal offered the\nfollowing explanation of his motive in perpetrating the hoax:\n(\u2026) I decided to try a modest (though admittedly uncontrolled) experiment: Would a\nleading North American journal of cultural studies (\u2026) publish an article liberally\nsalted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological\npreconceptions? (ibid.)\nSokal\u2019s hoax and its subsequent revelation caused a huge succ\u00e8s de scandale. The\nSokal affair received extensive media coverage not only in the United States but also in\nEurope and Latin America, provoking lively debates in both academic and non-academic\ncircles. Amongst many different issues raised in these debates, the following were particularly\ncontroversial: the (ir)relevance of postmodern critiques of science; the relation of the\nhumanities and social sciences to the \u2018hard\u2019 sciences; academic ethics and the consequences\nof undermining the professional trust of the community of one\u2019s scientific peers; and the\nacceptable standards of intellectual rigour in scientific and academic contexts. Apparently\nthese questions have still not lost their relevance even today.14\nThe complexity of the Sokal affair allows examination from many different\nperspectives and to study it with different theoretical goals in mind. In this paper an attempt is\nmade to analyze several argumentative aspects of the debate pertaining to the Sokal affair.\nThis will be done in the framework of a more comprehensive theoretical outlook related to the\nphenomenon of subversion in argumentative discourse and different strategies for dealing\nwith such subversion. After an elaboration of the general theoretical platform, the emphasis\n14\nFor follow-ups of the hoax, see Sokal and Bricmont, 1998; Sokal, 2010; and see:\nhttp://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/index.html.\n86 will be placed on the use of parody as a strategic device for countering a specific form of\nargumentative subversion, analysed through Sokal\u2019s example.\n1. The argumentative aspects of the debate: subversion in argumentative discourse and anti-\nsubversive strategies15\nThe term \u201csubversion in argumentative discourse\u201d is proposed here as an umbrella\nterm encompassing various forms of deviation from and violations of norms, standards and\ncanons of rational communication and argumentation. The term thus comprises a wide and\ndiversified range of phenomena, from employing intentional sophistic and eristic manoeuvres\nto merely neglecting to offer evidence and rational arguments in appropriate contexts.\nIn many cases the subversive quality of an argumentative act can be obfuscated by\nmore or less developed argumentative manoeuvres intended to create an impression of logical\nand argumentative correctness. Although the terms \u201cabuse\u201d or \u201cmanipulation\u201d could also be\nused to describe such phenomena, denoting them with the term \u201csubversion\u201d places the\nemphasis on the destructive effects they have on the very idea and practice of rational\ndiscussion and communication.\nThe possibility that one or more participants in rational communication may act in a\nsubversive manner raises the question of what the other participants can do to prevent the\nnegative effects of this kind of argumentative subversion. One possible answer would be to\nuse what may be described as \u201canti-subversive strategies\u201d\u2014i.e. the employment of various\ndevices to fight against the perceived disrespect of the canons of rationality and misuse of\nargumentative techniques.\n15 Sections 1 and 2 of the present paper are based on the author\u2019s presentation at the conference \u201cStrategies in\nArgumentation\u201d (Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Groningen, 14-15 February 2008), which was\nsubsequently published as an article in Macedonian (see Dimi\u0161kovska, 2009). In that article, the Sokal affair was\nalso mentioned as an example, but was not analysed at length.\n87 These devices are treated as \u201cstrategies\u201d for two main reasons. First, the situations in\nwhich they are practiced possess an explicit or implicit agonistic flavour, because rational\ndiscussions are often perceived as different kinds of battles which can be won or lost\ndepending on the verbal and argumentative skilfulness of the parties. This sense of \u201cstrategy\u201d\nis clearly related to the confrontational aspect of argumentative activity. Second, the blocking\nof argumentative subversion imposes the need to choose an optimal, context-bound plan of\naction in order to be effective. This need originates from the character of argumentation as a\ngoal-directed and rule-governed activity in which the desired end of justifying and refuting\nopinions must be reached by respecting the rules of use of reason and speech. Consequently,\nanti-subversive strategies must be adapted to the particular context, the specific profile of the\nopponent and the concrete type of breach of rules and principles of rational communication in\nthe given situation.\nBecause of this need to adapt strategies to specific conditions, any attempt to study\nstrategies for tackling argumentative subversion should include an attempt to capture the\ninherent diversity of their types and manner of application. This paper proposes a tentative\ntypology of anti-subversive strategies intended to serve as an initial approximation to\nsystematization, both in a descriptive and normative sense, of the vast field of their practical\ndeployment.16\n2. A typology of anti-subversive strategies\nThe proposed typology comprises the following four kinds: the \u201cappeal to norm\u201d\nstrategy; the \u201cappeal to institutional authority\u201d strategy; the strategy of \u201cignoring the sophist\u201d;\nand the \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d strategy. An attempt is made in this section to formulate\n16 Due to space limitations, a more detailed development of the concept of \u201csubversion in argumentative\ndiscourse\u201d and of the proposed typology of anti-subversive strategies cannot be presented in the framework of\nthis article.\n88 criteria for identifying each of these anti-subversive strategies, the conditions of their\nsuccessful use and the potential risks involved in their application.\n2.1. Appeal to norm\nThe \u201cappeal to norm\u201d strategy consists in showing that the other party in the\nargumentative interaction is employing an argument that violates one or more norms of\nlogical and argumentative discourse and is consequently fallacious. The goal of employing\nthis strategy is to restore the argumentative correctness of the dialogue by forcing the other\nparty to retract or modify the contested argument and all the propositions or arguments that\ndepend on that argument.\nSuccessful application of this \u201cappeal to norm\u201d strategy is dependent, however, on\nthere being a consensus amongst the participants in the rational interaction as to the regulative\nstatus of the norm being invoked. In this sense, the formal logical validity of an argument is\none of the strongest and most unquestionable criteria for its rational acceptance. For example,\nif the contested argument is shown to be logically invalid, withdrawing from it should follow\nimmediately since the formal invalidity of an argument eliminates the necessity of accepting\nthe conclusion even in cases when its premises are accepted.\nIt may be argued, however, that the norm of formal deductive validity is not the one\nand only norm to be taken into consideration when assessing the rational acceptability of\nargumentation. A number of supplementary criteria of argumentative correctness have been\nformulated in many contemporary approaches that address the dialogical aspects of rational\ncommunication and argumentation (Alexy, 1989; Barth and Krabbe, 1982; Grice, 1975/1989;\nEemeren and Grootendorst, 1984; Eemeren and Grootendorst, 1995; Eemeren and Houtlosser,\n2009; Rescher, 1977; Walton, 1992; Walton and Krabbe, 1995, etc.; cf. Eemeren and\nGrootendorst\u2019s rules for a critical discussion, Alexy\u2019s rules for general practical discourse,\n89 Grice\u2019s cooperative principle and conversational maxims, etc.). Despite many differences\nbetween these approaches, they all share a fundamental common feature, i.e., an attempt to\nelaborate wider complexes of norms and rules\u2014besides strictly logical ones\u2014that must be\nobserved to bring the verbal interaction as close as possible to the ideal of rational and critical\ndialogue.\nThe models developed in the aforementioned approaches reveal their potential\nvulnerability, however, when they are adopted in a strategic manner to detect a possible\nviolation of an argumentative norm by other participant(s) in the discussion. This\nvulnerability consists mainly in the fact that the normative force of these models is seriously\naffected by the still open problem of their justification. If the objection is raised that an\nopponent in a discussion is violating Alexy\u2019s rules of general practical discourse, for example,\nor Eemeren and Grootendorst\u2019s rules for critical discussion, the opponent could legitimately\nquestion the normative status of these rules. This is because such rules obviously do not have\nthe same logical and argumentative power as, say, the norm of the formal validity of\nconditional arguments. As a matter of fact, because of the lack of a single comprehensive and\ncanonical theory of argumentative discourse comparable to the theory of formal deductive\nlogic, the justification for those rules usually takes the pragmatic form of a consensus among\nthe participants of the discussion.17\nThere is therefore a need to elaborate different kinds of norms and criteria, besides the\ncriterion of formal logical validity, with which to determine the rational acceptability of\nargumentation\u2014especially in dialogically structured rational interactions. However, the\njustificatory force of these argumentative norms will still depend upon the particular system in\nwhich they are formulated and on the shared acceptance of their normative authority.\n17 For a discussion on the problems related to the concept of the conventional, intersubjective validity of pragma-\ndialectical discussion rules, see Zenker, 2011.\n90 2.2. Appeal to institutional authority\nWhile the \u201cappeal to norm\u201d strategy concerned violations of the rules for constructing\narguments, the \u201cappeal to institutional authority\u201d strategy is applied in cases of violation or\nabuse of established procedural rules of discussion (although the possibility is not excluded\nthat such cases may also include violations of the rules for the construction of arguments). For\nexample, a kind of argumentative practice that misuses the established procedural rules of\ndiscussion is the practice of filibustering which occurs in the framework of parliamentary\nprocedures. This consists in using the unlimited right of speech to delay or prevent the making\nof a decision on a legislative or other type of proposal.\nThe \u201cappeal to institutional authority\u201d strategy consists in invoking the institutionally\ngiven role and authority to block the argumentative subversion. It is obvious that this is\napplicable within institutionally structured and defined argumentative contexts such as the\nlegal context of adjudication and the context of parliamentary debates. The goal of employing\nthis strategy is to restore the procedural correctness of the argumentative exchange. Returning\nto the example of filibustering, there is also an institutional form of response to this kind of\nsubversion: the \u201ccloture\u201d procedure (used in the US senate, for example) which imposes\nrestrictions on the filibuster\u2019s unlimited right to speech and which is also initiated and applied\nin accordance with strict procedural rules.\nIn legal contexts, especially in litigation, the institutional authority to which one party\ncan appeal in order to protect himself or herself from the subversive intentions of the other\nparty is represented by the judge. Given the highly adversarial nature of paradigmatic legal\nlitigation, in which each party is driven by his/her own interest, it is obvious that there is a\nneed for some form of external guarantee\u2014or even coercion\u2014to ensure that the rules of\nrational argumentation are respected. Indeed, the procedural aspect of law includes numerous\n91 rules that regulate the argumentative and dialogical side of legal proceedings, including the\ninvocation of the institutional authority of a judge in cases of perceived argumentative\nsubversion or abuse.18\nThe successful application of this strategy clearly presupposes the existence of fair\nprocedure and the functionality of the institution whose authority is being invoked. If the\nprocedure in whose framework the argumentative exchange takes place is essentially unfair or\nbiased, and/or if the institutional authority that should guarantee procedural correctness is\ndysfunctional or partial, then the appeal to institutional authority as an anti-subversive\nstrategy will be ineffective if not directly counterproductive.\n2.3. Ignoring the sophist\nUnlike the previous two strategies, both of which are intended to restore\nargumentative and procedural correctness in cases when rational interaction deviates from its\noptimal course, the strategy of \u201cignoring the sophist\u201d consists in strictly refraining from\nengagement in argumentative discussion with the other party. Its application is triggered in\ncontexts in which it is estimated that the very possibility of rational discussion is undermined\nby the other party, whose profile and intellectual habits render futile any effort to comply with\nstandards of rationality in argumentation. The goal of this strategy is obviously to disqualify\nthe other party as a valid participant in rational discussion.\nOne particularly illuminative example of the application of this strategy can be found\nin Derrida\u2019s description of the way in which an audience of analytical philosophers in Oxford\nresponded to the lecture he delivered on diff\u00e9rance in 1967: \u201cOn that occasion the silence\nwhich followed was obviously eloquent. Eloquently saying: \u2018There is no arguing here and\n18 For example, the judge can prevent a party from asking the witness a suggestive question or allow the witness\nnot to an answer a self-incriminating question, etc.\n92 there is no prospect of arguing with this man, or with this discourse.\u2019.\u201d (cited from\nBadarevski, 2004: 264)\nThe application of this kind of strategy was recommended in Aristotle\u2019s writings as\nthe ultimate resort in situations where rational communication has become impossible due to\nthe intellectual habitus of the collocutor. In the eighth book of Topics, Aristotle thus suggests\nthe following:\nYou ought not to discuss with everybody (\u2026) for against some people argument is\nsure to deteriorate; for with a man who tries every means to seem to avoid defeat you\nare justified in using every means to obtain your conclusion, but this is not a seemly\nproceeding. (Topica, 164 b 9-10)\nHowever, this strategy also suffers certain weak points and potential risks, mainly\nrelated to the possibility of its abuse. For example, a participant in rational interaction\napplying this strategy might significantly underestimate the capacity of the other party for\nreasoned discussion and argumentation. Moreover, one might (mis)use this strategy to\ncompensate for one\u2019s inability to match the adversary in intellectual terms by calling him or\nher a \u201csophist\u201d and meta-subversively evading rational discussion. This is why the \u201cignoring\nthe sophist\u201d strategy should be applied with caution and only in specific, adequately assessed\ncircumstances.\n2.4. Fighting fire with fire\nThe fourth strategy of \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d is perhaps more complex than those\npreviously elaborated as it represents an indirect way of attacking the argumentative\nsubversion, i.e., by imitating it with critical and polemic intention. The use of parody, satire or\n93 irony in argumentative contexts could be treated as instances of adopting this particular\nstrategy.19\nThe name suggested for this strategy derives from the French expression \u201ccontre-\nfeux\u201d, denoting a fire deliberately set in front of another fire so as to create a vacuum and\nprevent its spreading. In the same sense as this metaphor, the goal of \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d\nis to overcome adversaries in argumentative encounters by using their own means. More\nspecifically, the main point of its application is to ridicule the other, intellectually abusive\nparty and to make them feel for themselves the negative and destructive effects of the\nsubversion of intellectual standards.\nThe successful application of this strategy presupposes that the targeted audience\npossesses sufficient knowledge of the phenomena which constitute the object of parody or\nsatire and that the audience shares the same negative value attitude towards this object. These\nconditions are necessary to ensure that the parodic intention of the author is understood and\nthat the argumentative impact is fully realised. Otherwise this strategy could either miss its\ntarget or have a self-defeating effect\u2014increasing rather than decreasing the intellectual appeal\nand popularity of the parodied works.\nThe application of the \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d strategy raises serious issues concerning\ncommunicational ethics. This is due to the lack of genuine commitment on the part of the\nperson using this strategy to the opinions which they advance in the discursive interaction,\npotentially involving an element of deceptiveness in the communication process. In order to\navoid the danger of producing \u201cmeta-level\u201d subversion, this strategy should also be applied\nwith great caution.\n3. The strategic aspects of Sokal\u2019s use of parody\n19 The following analysis concerns only forms of critically intended parody, \u201cparody-attack\u201d, which often turns\ninto satire. See below, section 3.\n94 The central idea of this paper, as mentioned in the introduction, is the proposal that\nSokal\u2019s parody may be treated as a representative example of the application of a \u201cfighting\nfire with fire\u201d strategy. This idea will be elaborated using the following elements\u2014triggers,\ngoals, conditions of successful application and weak points of the strategy\u2014as key parameters\nfor the analysis, contextualised in the particular circumstances of the Sokal affair. At the same\ntime, occasional comparisons with other strategies will make it possible to better perceive the\nspecificities of its nature and application.\n3.1. Triggers for the activation of the strategy\nIn the earlier section on theoretical analysis (2.4), it was suggested that the main\ntrigger for the application of a \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d strategy is the identification of some\nform of argumentative subversion followed by the impression that its direct, immediate\nblocking is either impossible or implausible.\nIn Sokal\u2019s case, as he says himself, it was his reading of Higher Superstition (1994) by\nPaul Gross and Norman Levitt that first led him to pursue the identification of subversive\ntendencies in the discourse in vogue in the field of humanities in the 1990s. According to\nSokal, the focus of this influential book was \u201cthe analysis of a curious historical volte-face\u201d\nconcerning one of the fundamental tenets of the Enlightenment legacy\u2014the belief that\n\u201crational thought and the fearless analysis of objective reality (both natural and social) are\nincisive tools for combating the mystifications promoted by the powerful \u2013 not to mention\nbeing desirable human ends in their own right\u201d (Sokal, 2010: 116).\nHowever, Sokal continues as follows:\n95 [O]ver the past two decades, a large number of \u201cprogressive\u201d or \u201cleftist\u201d academic\nhumanists and social scientists (\u2026) have turned away from this Enlightenment legacy\nand \u2013 bolstered by French imports such as deconstruction as well as by home-grown\ndoctrines like feminist standpoint epistemology \u2013 have embraced one or another\nversion of epistemic relativism. Moreover, a small but growing subset of these\nscholars have turned their critiques on the natural sciences, questioning not only the\npolitical and economic organisation of scientific research but also the alleged \u201ccultural\nprejudices inscribed in the very epistemology of scientific inquiry\u201d (\u2026). Gross and\nLevitt contend that these latter scholars, combining an inadequate philosophy of\nscience with an utter ignorance of the science they purport to criticize, have made\nfools of themselves and subverted the standard of scholarship. (ibid.)\nIn Sokal\u2019s view, the subversive quality of the criticised aspects of the work of \u201csome\nof the most prominent French and American intellectuals\u201d (Sokal, 2010:153), whom he\ndescribes as \u201cpontificating on science and its philosophy and making a complete bungle of\nboth\u201d (Sokal, 2010: xiii) included the following features: the advancing of \u201cmeaningless or\nabsurd statements\u201d, \u201cname-dropping\u201d, the display of \u201cfalse erudition\u201d, \u201csloppy thinking and\npoor philosophy\u201d (Sokal, 2010: 153).\nCategorising the reasons for his resorting to parody as \u201cpragmatic\u201d, Sokal gives the\nfollowing explanation of his choice of strategy for attacking the targeted forms of discourse as\nwell as their protagonists:\nThe targets of my critique have by now become a self-perpetuating academic\nsubculture that typically ignores (or disdains) reasoned criticism from the outside. In\nsuch a situation, a more direct demonstration of the subculture's intellectual standards\n96 was required. But how can one show that the emperor has no clothes? Satire is by far\nthe best weapon (\u2026) (Sokal 1996a)\nIn terms of the proposed classification of anti-subversive strategies, the \u201creasoned\ncriticism from the outside\u201d would probably represent a kind of application of the \u201cappeal to\nnorm\u201d strategy with the intention of demonstrating that the kind of discourse in question fails\nto comply with the rules and norms of rational argumentation. However, this approach would\nnot work in this situation; such a step would clearly presuppose the existence of a normative\nconsensus between the intellectual \u201cwar camps\u201d involved concerning the standards that\nguarantee the argumentative legitimacy of their discursive practices. And yet the very lack of\nsuch a consensus is obviously the factor which initially created the gap between the two\nacademic subcultures, the \u201cscientific\u201d and the \u201cpostmodernist\u201d. The \u201cappeal to norm\u201d strategy\nalso seems more plausible on the micro-argumentative level, in which there is a violation of a\nsingle argumentative rule (or several of them) that can be clearly identified and isolated from\nthe totality of the discourse. However, the form of subversion identified by Sokal in this case\nconcerns rather the macro-argumentative level, for it stems from objections to the discourse as\na whole, i.e. from the integral way of thinking and communicating in the framework of the\ncriticised intellectual community. This is why the most plausible way to deal with it was to\nmimic the totality of the targeted discourse by producing its parodied form, i.e. applying the\n\u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d strategy.\nAs far as the other strategies are concerned, i.e., the \u201cappeal to institutional authority\u201d\nand the \u201cignoring the sophist\u201d strategy, neither of these would be adequate in Sokal\u2019s\nsituation. The application of the first one would be impossible because of the fact that the\ncontroversy in question is not placed in an institutional context, which implies that there is no\ninstitutional authority (judge, arbiter etc.) to be invoked in order to block the subversion\naccording to pre-established procedural rules. The application of the second one would be\n97 implausible because of the fact that the ignoring of the opinions advanced by the intellectual\nadversaries would boil down to self-exclusion from the argumentative space and letting the\nsubversion stay unexposed and unblocked. And that is precisely the opposite of Sokal\u2019s\nintention in that case. In sum, it can be concluded that his application of the \u201cfighting fire with\nfire strategy\u201d was dictated by the specific circumstances of the concrete argumentative\nsituation and that, in those circumstances, it could be treated as a strategically adequate\nchoice.20\n3.2. The goal of the \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d strategy\nCommenting on the analysis presented in Gross and Levitt\u2019s book, Sokal observes that\n\u201csome of the writings they examine are so silly that they almost demand ridicule along with\nrefutation\u201d (Sokal, 2010: 136-137). In this sense, the writing of his parody fits in with the\ngeneral goal of the use of the \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d approach, which was defined above (in\nsection 2.4) as ridiculing the other, intellectually abusive party by making them experience the\nnegative and destructive effects of their own subverting of intellectual standards. Indeed, in\nhis paper \u201cTransgressing the boundaries: An afterword\u201d, published in Dissent, Sokal\nexplicitly stated that in his parodic, nonsensical article he used the very same means of\nargumentative subversion which could be identified in the criticised texts:\nLike the genre it is meant to satirize (\u2026) my article is a m\u00e9lange of truths, half-truths,\nquarter-truths, falsehoods, non sequiturs, and syntactically correct sentences that have\nno meaning whatsoever. (\u2026) I also employed some other strategies that are well-\nestablished (albeit sometimes inadvertently) in the genre: appeals to authority in lieu\nof logic; speculative theories passed off as established science; strained and even\n20 The ethical implications of this choice will be discussed later, in section 3.4.\n98 absurd analogies; rhetoric that sounds good but whose meaning is ambiguous; and\nconfusion between the technical and everyday senses of English words. (Sokal, 1996b;\nalso in Sokal, 2010: 93\u201394)\nSpeaking of his intentions to turn the subversion of intellectual standards against its\nmain perpetrators, Sokal remarks: \u201c(\u2026) the blow that can't be brushed off is the one that's\nself-inflicted. I offered the Social Text editors an opportunity to demonstrate their intellectual\nrigor. Did they meet the test? I don't think so.\u201d (Sokal, 1996a)\nIt is easy to see that the test to which the editors of Social Texts were subjected by\nSokal\u2019s submission of the article reveals a kind of tactical ingenuity\u2014a tactic that can be\ncompared to the tactic of a fork or double-attack in chess, whereby the attacker stands to\nbenefit from any possible response on the part of the adversary.\nThis phenomenon was nicely described by Michel Rio, one of the participants in the\ndebate surrounding the Sokal affair. According to Rio, Sokal falsified the targeted form of\ndiscourse in order to test the criteria for recognizing its validity. Thus, if the adherents of this\ntype of discourse (in this case the editors of Social Text) had identified the falsification\u2014in\nwhich case they would not have published the text\u2014they would have demonstrated the\nimportance of the criteria of intellectual rigour, which were clearly not met in the falsified\n(parodic) form of discourse. If, on the other hand, they failed to recognise the falsification and\nwent ahead and published the text, as actually happened, this would expose a fundamental\nflaw in their standards of academic and scientific rigour, implying that these standards are\neither inadequate or, worse, non-existent (Rio, 1997). In both cases, Sokal\u2019s point about the\nnecessity of adequate, rigorous standards of acceptability of scientific and philosophical\ndiscourses and their implications would be made in a convincing way. \u2018\n99 In order to understand the goal of using the \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d strategy in the\nargumentative situation created by the Sokal affair, it may be useful to explore Sokal\u2019s own\nopinion of the probative force and range of his \u201cexperiment\u201d. Thus, distancing himself from\nhis \u201cover-enthusiastic supporters\u201d who \u201chave claimed too much\u201d in his text \u201cWhat the Social\nText affair proves and does not prove\u201d, Sokal writes:\nFrom the mere publication of my parody I think that not much can be deduced. It\ndoesn\u2019t prove that the whole field of cultural studies or cultural studies of science \u2013\nmuch less sociology of science \u2013 is nonsense. Nor does it prove that the intellectual\nstandards in these fields are generally lax. (\u2026) It proves only that the editors of one\nrather marginal journal were derelict in their intellectual duty (\u2026) (Sokal, 2010: 152\u2013\n153; see also http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/noretta.html).\nAccording to Sokal, much more important than the conclusions which can be deduced\nfrom the fact of the publication of the parodic article are the conclusions that can be deduced\nfrom its content. Thus he points to the fact that \u201cthe most hilarious parts\u201d of his \u201cscreamingly\nfunny\u201d article were not written by himself but were \u201cdirect quotes from the postmodern\nMasters\u201d (ibid.).\nThe real targets of Sokal\u2019s critique are the \u201csloppy thinking\u201d and \u201cglib relativism\u201d\nallegedly prevailing \u201cin many parts of Science Studies (albeit not, by and large, among\nserious philosophers of science)\u201d (Sokal, 2010: 155\u2013156). Consequently, the main goal of\napplying the \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d strategy in this case consisted not in ridiculing a handful\nof trendy intellectuals or intellectually lazy editors but in undermining the epistemological\n100 credibility of the criticised form of discourse by practically demonstrating (what Sokal\nperceives as) its absurdity21 and unsoundness.\n3.3. Conditions for the successful application of this strategy\nAs mentioned above (section 2.4.), success in using parody as a form of the \u201cfighting\nfire with fire\u201d strategy is dependent on the fulfilment of certain conditions mainly related to\nthe audience that is targeted by the parody. First, it is necessary that the audience possesses\nsufficient knowledge of the parodied genre; otherwise, it would not be able to identify the\nelements of content and style that imitate the original work that is the object of the parody.\nSecond, the audience should correctly identify the author\u2019s critical intention; otherwise, it\ncould interpret his/her work in a standard, \u201cserious\u201d manner and completely ignore the\nparodic element. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the audience should share the negative\nvalue attitude towards the criticised/parodied phenomena. If the audience is strongly attached\nto the parodied phenomena, the intended parody could serve to affirm and praise its targets\nrather than undermine them.\nThis is precisely the kind of situation which occurred with the reception of Sokal\u2019s\narticle by the editors of Social Text. Because of their firm adherence to the discourse which\nwas the object of the parody and their attaching of a positive intellectual and ethical value to\nit, the editors were not only unable to recognise the parody but did not change their opinion\neven after Sokal had revealed his intent (Robbins, 1996). Consequently, independently of the\nintention of the author of the parody, the arguments in the submitted article were interpreted\n21 Perhaps, as Leo Groarke suggested in an informal discussion during the \u201cDays of Ivo \u0160kari\u0107\u201d conference,\nSokal\u2019s approach could be treated as an instance of reductio ad absurdum proof of the unsoundness of the\ncriticised form of discourse. However, my choice to describe it with the metaphorical expression \u201cfighting fire\nwith fire\u201d is motivated by the need to take into consideration not only the logical but also the rhetorical and\nethical aspects of the controversy, which are not explicitly emphasized in standard reductio ad absurdum\nprocedure.\n101 as standing on their own and as speaking in favour of rather than opposing the object of his\ncriticism.22\n3.4. The weak points and controversial aspects of the argumentative use of parody\nThe above-described phenomenon leads to the fourth and final point to be made in\nrelation to Sokal\u2019s parody as an instance of the \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d strategy. This\nconcerns the potential dangers of applying this strategy, i.e., the possibility of its being turned\nagainst those employing it and their original purpose, as well as the possibility of creating the\neffect of a higher-level subversion\u2014a kind of \u201cmeta-subversion\u201d.\nBelow, in sections 3.4.1 \u2013 3.4.5, I examine five potential weak points and\ncontroversial aspects of the argumentative use of parody.\n3.4.1. Popularisation of parodied phenomena\nAs the example of Sokal\u2019s use of parody shows, besides the already mentioned risk of\nparody being taken seriously and thus undermining its critical effect, there is also a risk of\npopularising the parodied phenomena to such an extent that they attract new adherents. Thus,\nthe intensive public debate related to the Sokal affair leaves the impression that there has been\na corresponding increase in the number of members of both confronted intellectual camps. If\nso, this would mean that Sokal\u2019s parody has indirectly contributed to an enlargement of public\nsupport not only for his own cause but also for the criticised one. In this sense, it could be said\nthat the \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d strategy here has produced the opposite effect of the strategy\nof \u201cignoring the sophist\u201d. For in the latter case, not entering into any kind of argumentative\n22 On this point, compare the question raised by Johnson and del Rio in their paper \u201cInterpretation and\nEvaluation of Satirical Arguments\u201d: \u201cIf a speaker or author makes a purposefully bad argument meant to\nillustrate the folly of someone or something, but that argument is interpreted by audiences in a serious way, then\nis the argument satirical or serious?\u201d (Johnson and del Rio, 2011: 891)\n102 interaction with the adversary also prevents the spread of interest and possible public support\nfor his/her stance.\n3.4.2. Deepening the gap between the adherents and the critics of the object of parody\nBy deeply dividing public opinion as to the legitimacy of the content as well as the\nmethod of Sokal\u2019s critique through parody, the Sokal affair also contributed to the\nmobilization of over-defensive attitudes on the part of the parodied authors and their allies,\nthereby \u2018heating up\u2019 the debate to an undesirable extent. This, in turn, has deepened the gap\nbetween the \u201cnatural sciences\u201d and the \u201csocial sciences and humanities\u201d camps, which was\npresumably not the original intent of the author of the parody. In this way the parody has\nserved to further undermine the prospect of genuine interdisciplinary cooperation (cf. Robbins\nand Ross, 1996).23\nThe fierce confrontations which broke out within intellectual circles as a result of the\nSokal affair created a situation, moreover, which could serve the interests of those political\nforces in society that feel threatened by the prospect of a strong, unified and critically oriented\nacademy. Worried by this possibility, Ellen Schrecker, although basically siding with Sokal in\nhis plea for strengthening the traditional academy by maintaining the highest standards of\nintellectual rigour, concludes her letter to Lingua Franca by expressing the following\nconcern: \u201cI am afraid that Sokal may not realize how potentially damaging his discursive\nbooby trap may be. (\u2026) I worry that Sokal's merry prank may well backfire and provide\nfurther ammunition for the forces that have damaged the academic community far more than a\nfew trendy theorists\u201d (Schrecker, 1996). Although the author of a parody cannot anticipate all\n23 The concern inspired by this situation is clearly formulated in the letter of Terry Reynolds to Lingua Franca\n(see http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/mstsokal.html) in the framework of the discussion concerning the Sokal\naffair. Revolted by the form of the debate which \u201chas taken the form of mutual accusation\u201d of \u201cscientists\u201d and\n\u201ccultural theorists\u201d, Reynolds writes: \u201cI resent Sokal's piece because he used his command of a powerful and\nfascinating discourse to fortify the boundaries between disciplines, and I resent the editors of Social Text because\nthey let him\u201d. (Reynolds, 1996)\n103 the effects the parody will have in the wider intellectual context, it is useful to bear in mind\nthe possibility that this kind of argumentative use of parody may have a strong confrontational\nimpact on the adherents and the critics of the forms of discourse being parodied.\n3.4.3. Deliberate deception and undermining the trust of the audience\nBesides the potential \u201cbackfiring\u201d effects of the argumentative use of parody, it seems\nthat the most controversial aspects of Sokal\u2019s use of parody are related to its ethical\ndimension, in the sense that his \u201cunorthodox experiment\u201d entailed his being deliberately\ndeceptive and undermining the trust of the professional community of academics and\nintellectuals. One of the most serious objections raised in relation to Sokal\u2019s submission of the\nparodic article is that by doing so he violated the principles of sincerity and veracity\u2014the\nfundamental principles of rational communication and inquiry. Consequently, he produced a\nkind of \u201cmeta-subversion\u201d not so different from that which was the target of his critique.\nHaving anticipated this objection, Sokal gave his response in \u201cA Physicist\u2019s\nExperiment with Cultural Studies\u201d. While acknowledging that he was not oblivious to the\nethical controversies involved in his \u201cexperiment\u201d, Sokal insisted on the fact that his article\nwas based on publicly available sources, using authentic, rigorously accurate citations, thus\nallowing readers to judge the validity and interest of these ideas independently of their\nprovenance or of the intimate relation of the author towards them (Sokal 1996a).24 Thus it\ntranspires that one of the many points of Sokal\u2019s paper is to show that the demand for\nauthorial sincerity, in the sense of an author\u2019s believing in their own arguments, must be\nsubordinated to the demand for logical and evidential support for the theses advanced. This is\nespecially important to bear in mind in situations when the professed general theoretical\n24 The same basic point was made by Paul Boghossian and Thomas Nagel who, in their letter to Lingua Franca,\nremark that \u201c[i]n the context of a purely philosophical/theoretical paper, it is not the business of an editorial\nboard to judge the sincerity of its authors, but only the cogency of their arguments. In the case of Sokal's paper,\nthat cogency was fully open to view.\u201d (Boghossian and Nagel, 1996)\n104 attitude of the author \u201cflatters the ideological preconceptions\u201d (ibid.) of the readers and could\neasily lead them astray into neglecting their intellectual duties by loosening the standards of\nargument evaluation, as was the case with the editors of Social Text.\n3.4.4. Using non-rational means for argumentative purposes\nA particularly important objection related to the deceptive aspect of Sokal\u2019s strategy\nconcerns the legitimacy or lack of legitimacy of using parody and satire in the context of\nrational discourse. This objection boils down to the claim that nonsense, deception and the\ncommunicative phenomena dependent on them are contrary to the very nature of rational\ndiscourse and cannot be a part of it, let alone be used as a means of restoring the rational\nmood of argumentation. As Johnson and del Rio remark: \u201cSatire and argument are a\ndangerous mix. What makes satire pleasurable is often how it differs from more rational\nargument. Satirical texts exaggerate and distort for comic effect resulting in sometimes little\nmore than an ad hominem attack. Satire asks us to laugh first and think second.\u201d (Johnson and\ndel Rio, 2011: 890)25\nIn the formulation of this kind of objection, deception and parody are apparently\ntreated in a similar way as being assimilated within the category of non-rational\ncommunicative devices. However, it seems that the soundness of this categorisation could be\nquestioned by recalling Grice\u2019s theory of conversational implicature (cf. Grice, 1975/1989).\nFollowing the basic tenets of this theory, it could be admitted that the mechanism of ironic\nand parodic discourse26 is indeed based on violation of one of the fundamental conversational\nmaxims\u2014that of quality, i.e., the \u2018rule\u2019 that says \u201cDo not say what you believe to be false\u201d.\n25 On this point, an even more radical opinion is advanced by Lee D. Carlson: commenting on the negative\naspects of the Sokal affair, Carlson advocates the excluding of parody and related phenomena from the area of\nrational discourse: \u201cDeception, sarcasm, parodies, and ridicule have no place in rational discourse, even though\nthey may sometimes have an amusing quality to them.\u201d (Carlson, 2008)\n26 The inclusion of parody in this perspective represents an extension of Grice\u2019s original position, which\nmentions irony, metaphor, meiosis and hyperbole as examples of flouting the maxim of quality. However, it\nseems that this extension is faithful at least to the spirit of Grice\u2019s theory, if not to its letter.\n105 Yet one of the main points of Grice\u2019s theory is the idea that violation of that maxim is not\nincompatible with respecting the general rational principle of conversational cooperation.\nThus, if a participant in the communication adheres to the principle of cooperation but still\nopenly and deliberately violates the maxim of quality, he or she, in fact, communicates an\nimplicit message which, in the case of figures of style like irony and, mutatis mutandis,\nsarcasm and parody, is precisely the opposite from the explicit content of the utterance (or of\na larger discursive unit). In fact the phenomena of what is called implicature or \u201cpragmatic\nconsequence\u201d are based on the functioning of the above-described mechanism, the steps of\nwhich allow for a more or less precise rational reconstruction.\nBearing this in mind, I adhere to the view that parody is neither irrational nor\ndeceptive in itself and that the general exclusion of its argumentative use would be too\nrestrictive. The structure of a paradigmatic parody includes, indeed, a deviation from the\nprinciple of sincerity and truthfulness. However, the main intention of the author of a parody\nis that this deviation be recognised and identified as such by the audience. Indeed, the\nrecognition of this intention is what makes the parody successful, because it gives the\naudience the indicators that its content should be interpreted in the \u201copposite\u201d way, i.e. that\nthe implicit message the author wants to communicate by parodying a piece of discourse\ncontradicts the explicit meaning of his/her words when interpreted in a standard way.\nOf course, the issue of the (ir)rational and deceptive character of parody and the\nlegitimacy of its argumentative use is far more complicated than is possible to present here. In\nthis particular context of analysis of the Sokal example, I will confine myself only to\nadvancing the thesis that what prevents the assimilation of parody and deception in one and\nthe same category is the essential difference in their conditions of success. Namely, a parody\nis successful when the intention of its author, i.e. the clue for interpreting his/her work in a\ncritical\u2014not in a standard\u2014way, has been rightly recognised and understood by the audience.\n106 Conversely, a deception is successful when the real intention of its author stays hidden from\nthe audience, i.e., when his/her discourse is not interpreted as it is really intended (which is, in\nfact, the essence of lying). This fundamental difference in conditions of success lends an\ninitial plausibility to the use of parody in a broader context of rational discourse, although the\nplausibility of the final result of this use will depend on many other contextual aspects and the\nspecific circumstances of the particular communicative and argumentative situation.\n3.4.5. Confusing \u201cparody\u201d and \u201choax\u201d\nStarting from this differentiation between paradigmatic parody and paradigmatic\ndeception, based on the criterion of the transparency of the author\u2019s intention, one final\nquestion concerning the argumentative aspects of the Sokal affair may be raised: Can the\nwords \u201choax\u201d and \u201cparody\u201d be used in a synonymous way (as they often are) in describing the\nnature of Sokal\u2019s original article?\nIf we stick to the standard meaning of \u201choax\u201d as a \u201cdeliberately fabricated falsehood\nmade to masquerade as truth\u201d27, the answer should be negative. Rather, it could be said that\nthe manoeuvre performed by Sokal was not simply to create a parody but to use his parodic\narticle in order to perform a successful hoax. But if we accept the thesis that deceptiveness,\nnotwithstanding appearances, is not an inherent feature of parody, this kind of use of parody\nnecessitates a subtle but essential deviation from the standard manner of its creation. This\ndeviation would consist in concealing the real intention of the author, because if it stays\ntransparent the parody would be identified as parody and the hoax would not be successful.\nIndeed, Sokal did make explicit moves in order to hide the parodic nature of his article,\nincluding the rewriting of passages which worried him by their potential \u201cto betray the hoax\u201d\n(Sokal, 2010: 36, # 93).\n27 Retrieved at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax. According to the source, the definition is Curtis D.\nMacDougall\u2019s.\n107 However, from the distinction between the fundamental nature of a hoax and that of a\nparody it follows that both cannot be successful simultaneously. In order for a hoax to be\nsuccessful, the parody as such must fail. Thus Sokal in fact \u201csacrificed\u201d parody by\ndeliberately trying to ensure that it was not recognised by the editors of Social Text, thus\nperforming a kind of \u201cdenaturation\u201d of the parody and subordinating it to a deceptive goal.\nOf course, as Boghossian and Nagel remark: \u201cSokal sought to conceal his own\ndisbelief in the nonsense he had so ingeniously cooked up; the experiment would not have\nworked otherwise.\u201d (Boghossian and Nagel, 1996) Still, in the context of analysing forms of\nargumentative subversion and strategies for tackling such subversion, this can be seen as a\nstep into the grey area of meta-level subversion. From this point of view, what is controversial\nin Sokal\u2019s approach is not the fact that he used parody for an argumentative purpose but the\nway in which he did so. First he denatured his parody into a hoax (or an element of hoax) and\nthen almost triumphantly announced that the parody had not been recognised as such by the\neditors of Social Text. Later, revealing the hoax, he still sought to benefit from the virtues of\nthe parodic genre as if it had been used in its pure form in which cooperativeness with the\naudience is presupposed.\nTo this kind of objection to Sokal\u2019s manoeuver, an advocate of Sokal\u2019s approach may\nreply that the audience of Sokal\u2019s parody, like that of any other parody, is in effect, naturally\ndifferentiated between those who are sensitive to the parodic content and those who are not.\nConsequently, it is argued, there is nothing objectionable in the fact that some of the audience\nrecognised Sokal\u2019s parody as such while another part did not (primarily the editors of Social\nText). Blinded by their ideological preconceptions and the fervour of the \u201cscience wars\u201d, so\nthe argument goes, the editors of Social Text simply excluded themselves from the first\ncategory of audience, missing the chance to identify the parody through their own fault, not\nSokal\u2019s fault.\n108 In response to this line of argumentation, it may be observed that while in \u201cnormal\u201d\ncases this differentiation of audience is a spontaneous effect of parody, it seems in Sokal\u2019s\ncase that such differentiation was one of the main goals of its construction. That is to say, the\nparody was deliberately calibrated in such a way that the members of the targeted group\nwould fall into the category of an audience \u201cinsensitive to the parody\u201d\u2014with all the\nunpleasant consequences that entails.\nPerhaps, however, as was suggested in the previous analysis, some kind of similar\nmeta-subversive manoeuvre is an inevitable element of the \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d strategy.\nIn order to attain its goal, this strategy often necessitates some kind of \u201ctransgressing the\nboundaries\u201d of normal and unquestionably legitimate way of using argumentative techniques.\nBut in assessing the implications of this transgression\u2014probably different in nature and\ndegree in each case of application of this strategy\u2014it is useful to bear in mind that two\n(argumentative) wrongs do not always make a right.\nConclusion\nAn attempt has been made in this paper to analyse some argumentative aspects of the\nSokal affair by focusing attention on the phenomenon of argumentative subversion and\ndifferent strategies for tackling such subversion. It was suggested that the way in which Sokal\nemployed parody for argumentative purposes may be treated as an instance of the application\nof the strategy of \u201cfighting fire with fire\u201d\u2014a device for countering argumentative subversion\nwhen blocking such subversion directly and immediately is either impossible or ineffective.\nBy means of parody, the intellectually abusive party is supposed to be ridiculed and forced to\nexperience the negative and destructive effects of their own subversion of intellectual\nstandards.\nSokal\u2019s use of parody as a means of combating argumentative subversion is an\nexample of a rare strategic inventiveness that enabled him to make his general point in a\n109 persuasive way. However, his approach involved several controversial aspects which were\nrevealed in numerous discussions related to the Sokal affair. These aspects concerned, on the\none hand, the legitimacy of employing non-rational means to attain rational argumentative\ngoals and, on the other hand, the backfiring effects of his strategy, i.e., the unintended effect\nof increasing the popularity of the parodied phenomena and deepening the already existing\ngap between the two intellectual \u201ccamps\u201d in \u201cthe science wars\u201d, thereby dividing the\nacademic community even further. A particularly serious objection addressed at Sokal\nconcerned the deceptive, trust-undermining aspect of his submission of a nonsensical paper to\na scholarly journal, thereby violating the principle of sincerity and veracity in academic work.\nIn his replies, Sokal met at least some of these objections with plausible arguments. In\nfuture research, these arguments may serve as the starting point for elaborating more general\nforms of conditions and directions for the successful application of the \u201cfighting fire with\nfire\u201d strategy in combating argumentative subversion.\nIn this article I have suggested that, from a theoretical and conceptual point of view,\nthe most controversial, albeit very subtle, manoeuvre performed by Sokal in applying his\nstrategy was his (ab)use of the parodic genre in order to hoax his targeted audience. The very\nneed to \u201creveal\u201d the parody suggests that it was deliberately \u201cconcealed\u201d, implying that it was\nnot employed in the natural, standard way that presupposes giving contextual clues to the\naudience for rightly recognising the critical intention of the author of the parody. The question\nas to whether there are good reasons to qualify this manoeuvre as a kind of \u201cmeta-subversive\u201d\nact, as well as the implications which would arise from such a qualification, remain open for\nfurther exploration.\nAnalysis of the relevant aspects of the Sokal affair from an argumentative point of\nview has shown the complexity and the multi-dimensionality of the use of parody as a\nstrategic device in argumentation. In order to succeed, this strategy demands highly specific\n110 conditions and careful application to ensure it achieves its goal and does not backfire on its\nusers. By extending this kind of analysis to other practical examples of the argumentative use\nof parody we will hopefully be able to gain a deeper insight into its positive and negative\nargumentative effects and to take a step forward towards elaborating more general criteria for\nits appropriateness in different contexts of rational communication.\nReferences\nAlexy, R.

CD ROM.\n114 The acts and strategies of defining\nFabrizio Macagno, Universidade Nova de Lisboa\nSummary\nDefinitions are not simply descriptions of meaning. They are acts that have different purposes and conditions.\nThey can be dialogical tools for altering and sometimes manipulating the hearers\u2019 commitments. They can be\nrhetorical instruments that can lead the interlocutor to a specific decision. The concept of persuasive definition\ncaptures the rhetorical dimension of the definitions of specific words, called \u201cemotive\u201d. By modifying their\nmeaning or the hierarchy of values that they are associated with, the speaker can redirect the interlocutor\u2019s\nattitudes towards a situation. From a pragmatic perspective, the meaning of a word can be described in different\nfashions, and be the content of different types of speech acts. Not only can the speaker remind the audience of a\nshared meaning, or stipulate or advance a new one; he can also perform definitional acts by omitting definitions,\nor taking them for granted. These silent acts are potentially mischievous, as they can be used to manipulate what\nthe interlocutors are dialogically bound to, altering the burden of proof. The implicit redefinition represents the\nmost powerful tactic for committing the interlocutor to a meaning that he has not agreed upon, nor that can he\naccept.\nKey words: Definition; Emotive language; Persuasion strategies; Speech act;\nImplicit definition\n1. Introduction\nAristotle defined the notion of definition (horismos) as a discourse, or an expression (logos)\nsignifying what a thing is, or rather, its essence (Topics, 101b 31; Chiba, 2010) by indicating\nits genus and its difference. However, he then pointed out that there can be other types of\n\u201cdiscourses\u201d (apart from the genus-difference one) that fall under the same branch of inquiry\nas definitions, as they are aimed at tackling questions of sameness and difference, and they\ncan be referred to as \u201cdefinitory\u201d. Such expressions describe the concept by setting out some\n115 of its accidents or properties that can uniquely (absolutely or in a given context) identify the\ndefiniendum.\nIn addition to their role as propositions that can establish a true or false (or rather an\nacceptable or unacceptable) equivalence between definiens and definiendum, the definitory\nexpressions have a pragmatic and dialogical dimension. Definitions are moves in a dialogue,\naimed at achieving specific dialogical purposes. We can use definitions to inform the\ninterlocutor of what a word means, or to stipulate or impose a new meaning of a term. We can\npropose a definition and support it with arguments, or we can commit ourselves to use a word\nwith a specific signification. We can also omit definitions, and use words with different,\nunaccepted or unacceptable meanings. When we define we perform an action. The semantic\nequivalence that we express is always directed to a pragmatic goal. Defining is always a form\nof action.\nThis pragmatic dimension is strictly related with a strategic, or rather argumentative\none. Words can be extremely powerful instruments. Terms like \u201cwar\u201d or \u201cpeace\u201d, \u201csecurity\u201d\nor \u201cterrorism\u201d can trigger evaluative conclusions, support implicit or explicit decisions, and\narouse emotions (Stevenson, 1937). These words are implicit arguments and tacit rhetorical\nstrategies. However, they have a potentially fallacious dimension, essentially connected with\ntheir definition, or rather their commonly accepted meaning. When wars become \u201cacts of\nfreedom\u201d (Doyle and Sambanis, 2006: 1) and bombings pacific operations, when\ndictatorships are named \u201cdemocracies\u201d and torture is referred to as a civil offense, the\nboundaries of semantic vagueness and definitional freedom are somehow exceeded, and\nwords are used not to describe reality, but to distort it. The distinction between a reasonable\nand acceptable use of a word and manipulation lies in the notion of definition and the\nconditions of defining or redefining.\n116 If the idea of an essential, immutable definition cannot be embraced (Sager, 2000: 217;\nWalton, 2005: 169-173), the alternative seems to be a relativistic approach (Schiappa, 2003).\nThe impossibility of determining an immutable meaning leads to the impossibility of\nverifying any definitory discourse, and therefore to the equivalence between any definition.\nHow is it possible to identify when words are used as weapons of deceit? Is it always possible\nto define any word, anyhow?\nThe purpose of this paper is to tackle the problem of the conditions of defining from a\npragmatic perspective, starting not from the propositional aspect of the definitional logos, but\nfrom its role as a move in a discourse, as a speech act. If definitional statements cannot be\nverified, definitional acts can be assessed taking into consideration their conditions and their\nlimits.\n2. Definitions as argumentative instruments\nThe first crucial aspect of definitions is the argumentative role of the definiendum. Words\nhave the power of affecting our emotions and influencing our decisions. Terms such as war or\nterrorism are usually judged negatively, and can be used to arouse negative emotions or elicit\nnegative judgments concerning the state of affairs they are used to refer to. For this reason,\nthe act of naming a fragment of reality can be considered as a form of condensed argument\nmade of two reasoning dimensions: a classification of reality and a value judgment.\nStevenson first underlined this twofold aspect of the use of a word when he\ninvestigated the terms that he called \u201cethical\u201d or emotive. He noted that some words, such as\n\u201cpeace\u201d or \u201cwar\u201d, are not simply used to describe reality, namely to modify the cognitive\nreaction of the interlocutor. They have also the power of directing the interlocutors\u2019 attitudes\nand suggesting a course of action. For this reason, they evoke a different kind of reaction,\n117 emotive in nature. As Stevenson put it (Stevenson, 1937: 18-19), \u201cInstead of merely\ndescribing people's interests, they change or intensify them. They recommend an interest in an\nobject, rather than state that the interest already exists.\u201d These words have the tendency to\nencourage future actions (Stevenson 1937: 23; Stevenson, 1938a: 334-335; Stevenson, 1938b:\n49-50), to lead the hearer towards a decision by affecting his system of interests (Stevenson,\n1944: 210). Stevenson distinguished these two types of correlation between the use of a word\n(a stimulus) and its possible psychological effects on the addressee (the cognitive and the\nemotive reaction) by labeling them as \u201cdescriptive meaning\u201d and \u201cemotive meaning\u201d\n(Stevenson, 1944: 54). Because of this twofold dimension, the redefinition of ethical words\nbecomes an instrument of persuasion, a tool for redirecting preferences and emotions\n(Stevenson, 1944: 210):\nEthical definitions involve a wedding of descriptive and emotive meaning, and accordingly have\na frequent use in redirecting and intensifying attitudes. To choose a definition is to plead a cause,\nso long as the word defined is strongly emotive.\nThe two crucial strategies for \u201credirecting and intensifying\u201d attitudes are the persuasive\ndefinition and the quasi-definition. Quasi-definitions consist in the modification of the\nemotive meaning of a word without altering the descriptive one. The speaker can quasi-define\na word by qualifying the definiendum (or rather describing its referent) without setting forth\nwhat actually the term means. The definitions provided by the famous Devil\u2019s dictionary\nmostly consist in this tactic. For instance, we can consider the following account of \u201cpeace\u201d\n(Bierce, 2000: 179):\nPeace: In international affairs, a period of cheating between two periods of fighting.\n118 Here, the speaker is not describing the meaning of \u201cpeace\u201d, but how a peaceful period of time\nshould be considered. The outcome is that a concept usually evaluated positively is turned\ninto one bound to the negative idea of deception.\nThe other tactic of redefinition of ethical words is called persuasive definition. The\nemotive meaning, namely the evaluative component associated with a concept, is left\nunaltered while the descriptive meaning, which determines its extension, is modified. In this\nfashion, imprisonment can become \u201ctrue freedom\u201d (Huxley, 1955: 122), and massacres\n\u201cpacification\u201d (Orwell, 1946). Persuasive definitions can change or distort the meaning while\nkeeping the original evaluations that the use of a word evokes. A famous example is the\nfollowing redefinition of \u201cpeace\u201d, or rather, \u201ctrue peace\u201d (Barack Obama, Nobel Peace Prize\nAcceptance Address Oslo, Norway December 10, 2009):\nPeace is not merely the absence of visible conflict. Only a just peace based on the inherent\nrights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting. Peace is unstable where citizens are\ndenied the right to speak freely or worship as they please; choose their own leaders or\nassemble without fear. A just peace includes not only civil and political rights -- it must\nencompass economic security and opportunity. For true peace is not just freedom from fear,\nbut freedom from want.\nWhile retaining its original positive emotive meaning, \u201cpeace\u201d is not referring anymore to\nabsence of conflict, but also to specific war operations. However, how can these two\ndimensions be described? How is it possible to analyze these two different types of meaning?\nA possible answer can be found in examining them from a reasoning perspective.\n119 3. Arguments in words\nThe relationship between descriptive and emotive meaning and the role of definition in\nredirecting attitudes can be analyzed from an argumentative perspective. The concept of\nmeaning can be accounted for as a form of reasoning that proceeds from a definition to a\nclassification of an entity, or from values and properties to a value judgment. The emotive and\nthe descriptive meaning can be seen as two different steps of reasoning, aimed at attributing to\nobjects, individuals or state of affairs a name or an evaluation.\n3.1. Describing reality\nDescriptive meaning was investigated by Stevenson in terms of effects on the hearer. The\ncognitive effect, or rather the information that the interlocutor can obtain from the use of a\nword, can be explained in terms of reasoning, and in particular through the process of\nattributing a predicate to a subject. The most generic form of reasoning describing this\nmechanism is an abstract structure of argument combining the semantic relation of\n\u201cclassification\u201d (Crothers, 1979; Hobbs, 1979: 68; Hobbs, 1985) with the logical rule of\ndefeasible modus ponens (Walton, 1996: 54):\nMAJOR PREMISE: For all x, if x has property F, then x can be classified as having\nproperty G.\nMINOR PREMISE: a has property F.\nCONCLUSION: a has property G.\nThe generic semantic relation needs to be specified by taking into consideration some of the\nancient maxims related to the topics of definition (Stump, 1989; Green-Pedersen, 1984). The\npassage from the predicate stated in the antecedent to the one attributed in the consequent\n120 needs to be grounded on a definitional semantic relation (Walton and Macagno, 2008), which\nconcerns any issue of identity and difference between two predicates (Aristotle, Topics 102a,\n5-9). This type of argument can be represented as follows (Walton and Macagno, 2010: 39):\nMAJOR PREMISE: For all x, if x fits definition D, and D is the definition of G, then x\ncan be classified as G.\nMINOR PREMISE: a fits definition D.\nCONCLUSION: a has property G.\nAs pointed out by Aristotle, the concept of definitional discourse includes different types of\nequivalences, of which the strongest and most famous is the definition by genus and\ndifference. However, the same concept can be defined using other definitory statements. For\ninstance, \u201cpeace\u201d can be defined by its absolute or relative properties (\u201cthe state of well-being\nthat is characterized by trust, compassion, and justice\u201d), by parts (\u201cthe union of hot peace and\ncold peace\u201d), or by its cause (\u201ca pattern of cooperation and integration between major human\ngroups\u201d). There are also other types of definition that are not used to explain the meaning of\nthe concept defined, but especially to communicate a judgment on it, such as the definition by\nmetaphor (\u201cpeace is a gentle breeze\u201d).\nArgument from classification and the different types of definitions that can be used for\ndifferent purposes can provide an explanation from an argumentative perspective to the\nphenomenon of descriptive meaning. The other dimension of meaning, the emotive one, can\nbe accounted for by considering another form of classification, not aimed at naming reality,\nbut rather at evaluating it. This pattern of reasoning proceeds from a different type of\nclassificatory principles: values.\n3.2. Argumentation from values\n121 According to Stevenson, emotive meaning is the propensity of a word to encourage actions.\nHowever, this type of \u201cmeaning\u201d is connected with a specific form of reasoning that is based\non propositions forming the grounds of our value judgments. This relationship emerges when\nit is attacked through the use of quasi-definitions. Using a quasi-definition, the speaker can\nundermine the implicit and automatic association between a concept and its evaluation. He\nneeds to provide an argument rejecting the grounds of a shared value judgment; for this\nreason, he describes the referent appealing to values contrary to the ones commonly\nassociated with such a concept. For instance, we can consider the following quasi-definition\ntaken from Casanova\u2019s Fuga dai Piombi. The speaker, Mr. Soradaci, tries to convince his\ninterlocutor (Casanova) that being a sneak is an honorable behavior (Casanova, 1911: 112)28:\nI have always despised the prejudice that attaches to the name \u201cspy\u201d a hateful meaning: this\nname sounds bad only to the ears of who hates the Government. A sneak is just a friend of the\ngood of the State, the plague of the crooks, the faithful servant of his Prince.\nThis quasi-definition underscores a fundamental dimension of the \u201cemotive\u201d meaning of a\nword, its relationship with the shared values, which are attacked as \u201cprejudices\u201d. This account\ngiven by the spy shows how the emotive meaning can be modified by describing the referent\nbased on a different hierarchy of values. The value of trust is not denied, but simply placed in\na hierarchy where the highest worth is given to the State.\nThe relationship between the use of a word, its meaning and the hierarchies of values\n(Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1951) can provide an explanation from a rhetorical\nperspective of the reason why words can lead to value judgments and decisions. Values can\n28 \u201cHo sempre disprezzato il pregiudizio che conferisce un odioso significato al nome di spia: questo nome non\nsuona male che alle orecchie di chi non ama il Governo: uno spione non \u00e8 altro che un amico del bene dello\nstato, il flagello dei delinquenti, il fedel suddito del suo Principe\u201d.\n122 be thought of as the reasons for classifying something as desirable or not, and, therefore, for\njudging the action aimed at achieving it as worthy or not. By describing an entity or a state of\naffairs as valuable, namely indicating the values that can be used to assess it, the speaker can\nprovide the interlocutor with a reason to act in a specific fashion. Values represent the\ncriterion for establishing the desirability of a course of action, and the generic form of\nreasoning based on them can be represented as follows (Walton, Reed and Macagno, 2008:\n321):\nPREMISE 1: Value V is positive (negative) as judged by agent A (judgment value).\nPREMISE 2: The fact that value V is positive (negative) affects the interpretation and\ntherefore the evaluation of goal G of agent A (If value V is good (bad),\nit supports (does not support) commitment to goal G).\nCONCLUSION: V is a reason for retaining commitment to goal G.\nFor instance, the action of spying, or the quality of being a \u201csneak\u201d can be classified as\ncontemptible or hateful based on the classifying principle (value) that can be expressed as\nfollows: \u201cWho betrays the trust of another is a bad (contemptible\u2026) person.\u201d On the contrary,\nSoradaci rejects such a principle and advances a different hierarchy of values: supporting the\ngood of the State is the supreme good; therefore, whoever betrays another for the good of the\nState is a good person.\nThis type of reasoning is grounded on a judgment, which becomes a reason to carry\nout a specific action. Values represent the different ways and principles that are used to\nestablish what is good or bad. In its turn, the moral judgment becomes a reason to act. The\nrelationship between will, and desire, and action is underscored in Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean\nEthics. What is good, or appear as such, is maintained to be the goal of a decision to act\n(Nicomachean Ethics, 1113a15), as \u201ceverything aims at the good\u201d (Topics, 116a 18). For\n123 instance, an \u201cact of war\u201d is usually regarded as negative, and naming an operation as such can\nbecome a reason for criticizing it. On the other hand, an \u201cact of peace\u201d, or a humanitarian\nintervention leads to an opposite judgment, and suggests a different course of action.\nSimilarly, in the case above, a \u201csneak\u201d is not only despised, but cannot be trusted. Despite\nSoradaci\u2019s strenuous defence of the spies, Casanova cannot ignore his previous hierarchy of\nvalues, and for this reason he cannot trust him. On the contrary, he lies to him all the time.\nThe decision-making process can be thought of as a pattern of reasoning connecting an\naction, or rather a \u201cdeclaration of intention\u201d or commitment (von Wright, 1972: 41) with its\ngrounds (Anscombe, 1998: 11). The grounds can be provided by the simple positivity or\nnegativity of a course of action, or the presumption of continuity of a person\u2019s negative or\npositive behavior (Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1951). Depending on whether the speaker is\nassessing a specific course of action or considering a goal, the type of reasoning can have\ndifferent forms. The first and simpler form of argument is the argument from consequences\n(Walton, Reed & Macagno, 2008: 332)\nPREMISE 1: If A is brought about, good (bad) consequences will plausibly occur.\nPREMISE 2: What leads to good (bad) consequences shall be (not) brought about.\nCONCLUSION: Therefore A should be brought about.\nFor instance, if a sneak usually betrays friends, trusting a sneak can probably lead to betrayal.\nSince betrayal is a negative outcome, a sneak should not be trusted. Similarly, the\nclassification of an operation as humanitarian or an act of peace underscores its peaceful\nconsequences, suggesting to the interlocutor to support it.\nThe other form of reasoning, called practical reasoning, is more complex, as it\nproceeds from a value to the means that can possibly bring it about (Walton, Reed &\nMacagno, 2008: 323):\n124 PREMISE 1: I (an agent) have a goal G.\nPREMISE 2: Carrying out this action A is a means to realize G.\nCONCLUSION: Therefore, I ought to (practically speaking) carry out this action A.\nThis argument is frequently used to justify a potentially objectionable decision by\nhighlighting a hierarchy of values. For instance, war is despicable, but when it is the only\nmeans to free people from a dictatorship it can be seen as positive. Similarly, lying is\ncontemptible, but if it is the only way to avoid betrayal, it becomes a justified course of action.\n4. The acts of defining\nRedefinitions can be extremely powerful and sometimes dangerous instruments. By\nmodifying the definition of a word, the speaker can alter the interlocutor\u2019s perception and\nevaluation of reality. He can distort reality and the appraisal thereof. However, definitions and\nredefinitions are extremely common moves, often necessary for clarifying new or obscure\nconcepts or highlighting some of their dimensions. The crucial problem lies in the\nidentification of a criterion for distinguishing deceitful definitional moves from the non-\nfallacious or simply persuasive ones. As noticed above, not only are there several definitions\nfor the same definiendum, but there are also different ways of defining the same concept. In\norder to analyze the boundaries of definitions and redefinitions, it is necessary to shift from a\npropositional to a pragmatic level. Definitions can be fallacious or acceptable because they\nare acts, moves in a discourse. Definitions can have different purposes: they can be\ninstruments for informing, imposing a meaning, or advancing a viewpoint. Accordingly, they\nare subject to different pragmatic conditions.\n125 4.1. Definitions as reminders\nIn his Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Address, Obama needed to argue in favor of an\nextremely complex position: the president of a state engaged in different wars all over the\nworld should be considered as the clearest champion of peace. In order to support this claim,\nat the beginning of his speech he underscores a fundamental principle that his audience should\nbe acquainted with: wars can be justified. For this purpose, he reminds his audience of the\nconcept and meaning of \u201cjust war\u201d (Barack Obama, Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Address\nOslo, Norway December 10, 2009):\nDefinition as a piece of information or a reminder: \u201cpeace\u201d\nThe concept of a \"just war\" emerged, suggesting that war is justified only when it meets\ncertain preconditions: if it is waged as a last resort or in self-defense; if the force used is\nproportional, and if, whenever possible, civilians are spared from violence. [\u2026]What I do\nknow is that meeting these challenges will require the same vision, hard work, and persistence\nof those men and women who acted so boldly decades ago. And it will require us to think in\nnew ways about the notions of just war and the imperatives of a just peace.\nObama is not advancing a new claim, but bringing to light a commitment that is or should be\nshared by his interlocutors. Definitions of basic cultural concepts need to be known by a\ncommunity of speakers. By underscoring the ancient origin of \u201cjust war\u201d, Obama is making\nsure that its definition is part of the audience\u2019s common ground. In this fashion, he reinforces\nthe hearer\u2019s commitment to such a concept, or rather he undermines the objectionability\nthereof. He reminds and informs the audience that the idea that wars (and in particular the\nones waged or fought by the United States) can be justified cannot be considered as\n126 controversial. We can represent the structure of this act of defining as follows (Searle and\nVanderveken, 2005: 129):\nContent Speaker\u2019s Hearer\u2019s Effects on the Effects on the\nMove\nconditions commitments commitments speaker hearer\nInforming p represents a state S has grounds \u00b7 H is / should be S is committed to \u00b7 Acknowledge\n(Hearer; of affairs / supporting that H committed to p. H\u2019s Comm. to p. Comm. to p).\nCommitment to p). judgment / is/should be\n\u00b7 H knows / \u00b7 Reject (Comm.\ndecision. committed to /\nshould know p. to p) based on\nknows p.\nreasons.\nJust war is a war Meaning of \u201cjust People are The interlocutors\nthat is justified war.\u201d presumed to know cannot ignore the\nwhen some what is generally definition.\npreconditions are shared. The interlocutors\nmet. need to accept it or\nAuthorities in the\nshow that it is not\npast defined it.\nshared.\nTable 1: Defining for reminding - Dialectical profile\nBy reminding the audience of a definition, the speaker can take advantage of the presumption\nthat the definition is, or should be, already part of the interlocutors\u2019 commitments. The burden\nof proof is shifted onto the hearers, who need to show that such a definition cannot be\nconsidered as part of the common ground.\n4.2. Definitions as standpoints\nDefinitions can be used to advance a new meaning for a concept, or simply propose the\nexistence of a new or more specific one. In this case, the speaker is not presuming that the\nmeaning described is shared. On the contrary, he acknowledges that it is not part of the\ninterlocutors\u2019 common ground, and for this reason he accepts the burden of proving it, or\nsupporting it with arguments. A clear example can be found in the same Nobel Peace Prize\nAcceptance Address mentioned above. Obama splits the notion of peace into two concepts, a\n127 \u201ctrue peace\u201d, amounting to a status characterized by the \u201cinherent rights and dignity of every\nindividual\u201d and a \u201cfalse\u201d one, which corresponds only to the commonly shared definition of\n\u201cabsence of visible conflict\u201d. In order to support his standpoint, Obama underscores that only\nthe first one can be lasting (Barack Obama, Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Address Oslo,\nNorway December 10, 2009):\nDefinition as a standpoint: \u201cpeace\u201d\nFor peace is not merely the absence of visible conflict. Only a just peace based upon the\ninherent rights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting. [\u2026]\nThis type of move can be described as a kind of a speech act of assertion, which commits the\nspeaker to defending it if requested to do so (Houtlosser, 2001: 32). This condition can be\nshown in the following dialectical profile, pointing out its different components and\nrequirements.\nContent Speaker\u2019s Hearer\u2019s Effects on the Effects on the\nMove\nconditions commitments commitments speaker hearer\nAdvancing as a p represents a \u00b7 S believes that H is not committed \u00b7 S is committed \u00b7 Accept (p).\nstandpoint (p). judgment / H does not to p (already, at to p.\n\u00b7 Question (p).\nproposal.

He provides reasons to believe that the ordinary account of peace is not\nsufficient, and proposes a different view whose positivity he highlights by marking it as the\n\u201ctrue\u201d one.\n4.3. Definitions as commitments\nAs seen above, the definition-reminder represents a previous or presumptive commitment of\nthe interlocutor, while a definition advanced as a standpoint presupposes that such an account\nof meaning is, or can be, not shared. Definitions can be also used to bind the speaker to a\ncommitment, playing the role of a commissive, a type of promise that he makes to his\ninterlocutor. A clear example can be found in Obama\u2019s Inaugural Address (In a Dark Valley:\nBarack Obama's Inaugural Address), where the U.S. President does not explain nor propose a\nnew meaning, but commits himself to a specific use of a crucial term29:\nDefinition as a commitment: \u201cWe-ness\u201d\nWe -- and in this presidency, when I use that word, I will mean you and me, not the royal \"we\"\nto which American presidents have become far too attached -- we can, I think, hope to\naccomplish much, but only if we're honest with ourselves.\nObama uses the definition of the pronoun \u201cwe\u201d to commit himself to using it with a specific,\nstrategic meaning. He distinguishes two uses, corresponding to two classes of people: the\npluralis maiestatis, used by his predecessors, and the ordinary meaning, which he commits\nhimself to. The definition constitutes a promise of refusing the \u201croyal we\u201d, and mirrors and\n29 Prelude to an Inaugural. (Retrieved from http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/KA15Aa02.html on 26\nAugust 2012).\n129 shows a political attitude where the people become an active part of the President\u2019s decisions\nand choices. The definition becomes a metaphor of his political behavior, to which he\ncommits. This act of defining can be represented as follows:\nTable 3: Defining for committing - Dialectical profile\nThe committing definition inserts the obligation to use a word with a certain meaning into the\nspeaker\u2019s commitment store, not affecting the interlocutor\u2019s one. This type of definition is\nextremely strategic, as it imposes a language use commitment onto the speaker, but at the\nsame time binds the interlocutor to a specific interpretation of the word. Without imposing the\nmeaning of a term, the speaker imposes how it shall be interpreted in his discourse.\n4.4. Stipulative definitions\nDefinitions can be used for imposing a new meaning. The speaker can stipulate (Robinson,\n1950: 59; Leonard, 1967: 286; see also Viskil, 1995) what a word means, so that a\ncommitment is inserted into the speaker\u2019s and the hearer\u2019s commitment stores. He is binding\nthe interlocutor to a specific word use. In order to perform this act, the definer needs to have\nthe authority to do so. For instance, this definitional move is characteristic of lawmakers, as\nthey have the authority of deciding what the words in the laws mean. Stipulative definitions\n130 can be used to alter the meaning of a commonly shared word, so that the implications of the\nold use are associated with new referents (Schiappa, 1998: 31). For instance, the concept of\n\u201chomeland security\u201d was first introduced and defined in 2002 to refer to measures against\nterroristic attacks. However, in 2007 and 2010 it was redefined to ensure that the same\nexceptional measures were used also to prevent other types of threats. In order to deal with\nsome emergencies, among which was the hurricane Katrina, proposals for a definitional\nchange were advanced to include \u201cman-made and natural hazards\u201d (see Bellavita, 2008),\nuntil in 2011 a new definition was stipulated (Quadrennial Homeland Security Review\nReport, February 2010: 13)30:\nImposing a redefinition \u201chomeland security\u201d\nHomeland security is meant to connote a concerted, shared effort to ensure a homeland that is\nsafe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards where American interests,\naspirations, and way of life can thrive.\nThe implications of the old concept were kept (if something threatens homeland security,\nexceptional measures shall be taken), but the category of threats to homeland security was\nenlarged to include also cyber-terrorism. In this fashion, a prompt response to new types of\ndangers was guaranteed. We can represent the speech act of imposing a definition as follows:\n30 www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/qhsr_report.pdf .

The redefinition creates a coexistence of meanings, so that the conclusions usually\nsupported by the old one are also drawn when the newly defined word is used.\n5. The acts of non-defining\nUsually actions are associated with the \u201cstate or process of doing something\u201d. As seen above,\nverbal actions are performed in order to bring about specific conversational effects. However,\nthe agent can cause intentionally some effects also by failing to perform a specific activity.\nFor instance, the so called \u201ccode of silence\u201d results in criminals being not prosecuted. In law,\nomissions are defined in terms of the duties to act, as breaches of an affirmative duty to\n132 perform the omitted actions (Glanville, 1983: 148-149; Fusco, 2008: 86). However, outside\nthe codified domain of law the concept of omission can become more complex to define.\nOmission can be regarded as an act of a kind where the agent decides not to perform an action\nthat was sufficient for the occurrence of a specific consequence at a later time (Aqvist, 1974;\nChisholm, 1976; Walton, 1980: 317). In this sense, an omission is characterized by a\ndeliberate decision to leave open the possibility of the occurrence of a specific state of affairs.\nFor instance, the omission to report a crime does not prevent the authorities from being\ninformed of prosecuting it. However, such a non-action leaves this possibility open by a\ndeliberate choice.\nDefinitions can represent the propositional content of two different types of non-acts:\nthe act of omitting a definition and the act of taking it for granted. While in the first case the\nspeaker fails to provide a needed definition, in the second case he uses a word with a specific\nmeaning, but omits the act of putting it forward. By deciding not to advance or to impose the\ndefinition he is using, he takes it for granted, performing a specific tacit act.\n5.1. Omitted definitions\nDefinitions set out the conditions for the classification of a concept. The crucial importance of\na definition emerges especially in the case in which it is lacking. The speaker may decide not\nto define a concept, so that he is not committed to any specific account of its meaning. For\ninstance, with the amendment 1034 to the US Code, a new meaning of \u201carmed conflict\u201d was\nstipulated, in which the boundaries of this concept set out by the Geneva Conventions (Article\n1 of Additional Protocol II \u2013 Geneva Convention 1949) were extended to include also\noperations against terrorists and the supporters thereof. However, this amendment mentions\ntwo concepts whose meaning cannot be the same as the ordinary one (emphasis added):\n133 Omitting definitions: \u201cBelligerent and Hostilities\u201d\n(4) the President's authority pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public\nLaw 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) includes the authority to detain belligerents, including\npersons described in paragraph (3), until the termination of hostilities.\nIn this definition the words \u201cbelligerent\u201d and \u201chostilities\u201d are not defined, even though their\nmeaning cannot correspond to the ordinary one after the extended definition of \u201carmed\nconflict\u201d. In 2009 \u201chostilities\u201d was first defined as \u201cany conflict subject to the laws of war.\u201d\n(10 U.S.C. \u00a7 948a 9). However, in the aforementioned stipulative redefinition of \u201carmed\nconflict\u201d the idea of \u201chostilities\u201d could not be governed by the laws of war, as armed conflicts\nagainst terrorists cannot fall within the definition that is shared all over the world. Similarly,\n\u201cbelligerents\u201d cannot be simply limited to soldiers, as the new category of \u201cwar\u201d encompasses\nalso terrorism and non-ordinary conflicts. The legislators omitted to define such terms, and\nthe result was that a classificatory freedom was introduced, which could allow the extension\nof security measures, such as interrogation and detention, also to suspected terrorists31.\nAs mentioned above, omissions are deliberate non-actions, where the agent decides\nnot to provide what is requested or needed in order to achieve a specific effect. The definition\nthat is deliberately not mentioned is known not to be shared, and the effects of such an\nomission are known by the (non-) speaker. One of the clearest cases of this relationship\nbetween omission and its effects is the lack of the definition of \u201ctorture\u201d in the Russian and\nArmenian Criminal Codes. The Russian and Armenian governments were requested to define\nsuch a crucial term in order to curb the violence denounced by Amnesty International and\nother international Authorities (CAT/C/34/Add.15, 15 October 2001, art. 1 (4), p. 3;\n31 See for instance the proposal of introducing the \u201cenemy belligerent act in Enemy Belligerent Interrogation,\nDetention, and Prosecution Act of 2010. (Retrieved from http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/s3081 on 24\nAugust 2012)\n134 CAT/C/SR.246, 1996; EUR 54/02/00, April 2000, par. 2). Such governments knew the effects\nof the absence of a definition, which allowed them to avoid prosecuting crimes of torture by\ncategorizing them as \u201cviolations of professional discipline.\u201d32 Moreover, they had any power\nto comply with the request of the United Nations. The structure of the act of omitting a\ndefinition can be understood from the cases mentioned above and represented as follows:\nContent Speaker\u2019s Hearer\u2019s Effects on the Effects on the\nMove\nconditions commitments commitments speaker hearer\nOmitting (a speech \u00b7 Fp represents a \u00b7 S has the \u00b7 S is not \u00b7 H\u2019s dialogical\nact - Fp) dialogical move. commitment to committed to Fp. situation has been\nperform Fp \u00b7 S is not altered (E).\n\u00b7 Fp can be\n(CFp). committed to\nperformed by S.\nrefuse(Fp).\n\u00b7 CFp results\n\u00b7 S is not\nfrom an\ncommitted to E.\ninstitutional or\nsocial obligation.\n\u00b7 S knows that\nnon- Fp causes\neffect E.\n\u00b7 S knows that Fp\nis necessary to\navoid E.\nOmission of the Russian Russia and Russia (Armenia) The category of\ndefinition of (Armenian) Armenia were are not committed \u201ctorture\u201d can be\n\u201ctorture\u201d. governments had requested to define to a specific applied arbitrarily.\nthe power to define \u201ctorture\u201d and meaning of\n\u201ctorture\u201d. blamed for not \u201ctorture\u201d.\ndoing it.\nTable 5: Omitted definitions \u2013 Dialectical profile\nThe omission of the definition of \u201ctorture\u201d clearly differs from the non-definition of \u201chostility\u201d\nand \u201cbelligerent\u201d. In the first case the speaker\u2019s commitment to the speech act of defining (or\nrefusing to do it) results from an explicit act (request). In other cases, the commitment can\nderive from an institutional (legal) or a communicative rule, \u201cavoid ambiguity.\u201d In both cases,\nthe speaker is aware of the requirement (or expectation) and deliberately refuses to comply\nwith it, knowing its effects. The omission of a definition leads to a specific effect: the\n32 Torture in Russia: \"This man-made hell\". AI Index: EUR 46/04/97. Amnesty International April 1997 (pp. 28-\n29). (Retrieved from http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/EUR46/004/1997/en on 21 September 2011)\n135 possibility of implicitly redefining the definiendum, or rather using it with new unshared\nmeanings. This latter move can be considered as a distinct act of a kind, the act of implicitly\ndefining.\n5.2. Implicit definitions\nThe omissions of definitions are strategic moves as they do not prevent vagueness or\nambiguity; on the contrary, they can introduce them. The absence of a definition leaves open\nthe possibility of defining or redefining a concept. More importantly, the lack of an explicit\ndescription of a word meaning allows the speaker to stipulate it implicitly. The speaker can\ntake advantage of a controversial concept, not explicitly defined, and use it with a new,\nunshared definition. In this fashion he simply takes its definition for granted; and treats it as it\nwere already part of the community\u2019s common knowledge.\nOne of the most famous cases is the implicit redefinition of \u201chostility\u201d used by Obama\nto classify the American intervention in Libya. In order to avoid requesting the Congress\u2019\nauthorization to continue the hostilities (War Powers Resolution, sec. 5b, Public Law 93-148),\nthe President needed to exclude the bombings in Libya from the boundaries of the concept of\n\u201chostilities.\u201d He took advantage of the absence of its definition in the War Powers Resolution\nAct (US Code 1541). The vagueness of the boundaries of \u201chostilities\u201d allowed Obama to\nredefine it to exclude the American strikes in Libya. He did not advance or impose any new\nmeaning. He simply used the term claiming that it could only refer to ground troop\nintervention, sustained fighting and exchanges of fire. He presupposed a tacit definition from\nwhich airstrikes were excluded, let alone when carried out by unmanned aircraft (Obama\nAdministration letter to Congress justifying Libya engagement, June 15th, 2011, p. 25)33:\n33 Retrieved from http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/204673/united-states-activities-in-libya-6-15-11.pdf\non 25 August 2012.\n136 Implicit redefinition: \u201cHostilities\u201d\nThe President is of the view that the current U.S. military operations in Libya are consistent\nwith the War Powers Resolution and do not under that law require further congressional\nauthorization, because U.S. military operations are distinct from the kind of \u201chostilities\u201d\ncontemplated by the Resolution\u2019s 60 day termination provision. [\u2026] U.S. operations do not\ninvolve sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire with hostile forces, nor do they involve\nthe presence of U.S. ground troops, U.S. casualties or a serious threat thereof, or any\nsignificant chance of escalation into a conflict characterized by those factors.\nHere Obama is not performing any explicit act of defining, nor is he rejecting or attacking the\nshared one. He is just taking such definition for granted (Macagno 2012). He presupposes that\n\u201chostility\u201d means only \u201cactive fighting by ground troops\u201d, contrary to any accepted definition\nof the term under the US laws or military dictionaries.\nThrough his implicit act, Obama imposes a new meaning without being committed to\nany stipulation or any definitional standpoint. His tacit act binds the speaker and the audience\nto a specific commitment, i.e., that \u201chostility\u201d meant only \u201cactive fighting by ground troops\u201d.\nSearle and Vanderveken provided a generic rule from indirect speech acts that can be used to\ndescribe this kind of implicit speech act performed through the use of the presupposed\ndefinition for classifying the bombings in Libya (Searle and Vanderveken, 2005: 130). On\ntheir view, the assertion of a classification (F (p )) commits the speaker to its sincerity\n1 1\nconditions, namely that he believes the \u201chostility\u201d has the proposed meaning. However, the\nassertion is possible only if another act is performed (F(p)), consisting in the stipulation of a\nnew meaning of such a concept. The classification commits the speaker to the illocutionary\npoint of an implicit act, imposing that \u201chostility only means active fighting by ground troops\u201d.\nWe can represent the commitment structure of this implicit act as follows:\n137 Content Speaker\u2019s Hearer\u2019s Effects on the Effects on the\nMove\nconditions commitments commitments speaker hearer\nPerforming (Fp) \u00b7 Fp represents a (depend on the (depend on the \u00b7 S is committed \u00b7 Commitments\nimplicitly by dialogical move. nature of F 1p 1). nature of F 1p 1). to F 1p 1. resulting from\nperforming F 1p 1.

In this case, Obama could not have stipulated explicitly such a definition, as he\nhas not the authority to do so, nor could he have advanced it, as the nature of his act of\ndefending a standpoint requires the previous acceptance of the definition.\nObama\u2019s move is extremely powerful from a dialogical perspective. He is inserting\ninto the interlocutors\u2019 commitment store a proposition that they could not possibly have\nshared (and we know this because Obama stipulated the new meaning). Moreover, contrary to\nthe act of advancing a definition, he did not have the burden of proof here. The dialogical\noutcome of his move is to shift the burden of proof. The interlocutors become committed to a\nproposition they never accepted, and they carry the burden of rejecting this commitment.\n138 They need to prove that the definition is not part of their common ground. In this case, the\nMembers of Congress had to prove that the definition was not the accepted one, which\nbecame extremely difficult, as there is not a legal definition of the concept in the act. Obama,\ninstead of advancing arguments to support an extremely controversial point of view, played\nthe defensive role, consisting in assessing the acceptability of the rebuttals. The implicit\nredefinition changes the dialogical roles of the participants to the discussion, shifting onto the\nother party the burden of disproving a controversial (and unacceptable, in this case) meaning.\n6. Conclusion\nDefinitions are not simply descriptions of meaning. They are not only equivalences between a\nword and a phrase. They are rhetorical instruments that can lead the interlocutor to a specific\ndecision. They are acts that have different purposes and conditions. They are dialogical tools\nfor altering and manipulating the hearers\u2019 commitments. The concept of persuasive definition\nunderscores the rhetorical dimension of the definitions of specific words, called \u201cemotive\u201d.\nBy modifying their meaning or the values that they are associated with, the speaker can\nredirect the interlocutor\u2019s attitudes towards a situation. A war can become an act of peace, and\nthus it can be justified and praised; a felony can be presented as an act of loyalty, and thus it\ncan be positively regarded. The meaning of a word can be described in different fashions, and\nbe the content of different types of speech acts. The speaker can use a definition to stipulate a\nnew meaning, or remind the audience of the shared one. However, he can perform definitional\nacts also by omitting definitions, or taking them for granted. These silent acts are the most\ndangerous and potentially mischievous ones, as they can be used to manipulate what the\ninterlocutors are dialogically bound to, altering the burden of proof. The implicit redefinition\nrepresents the most powerful tactic for committing the interlocutor to a meaning that he has\n139 not agreed upon, nor that he can accept. The speaker thereby eludes the burden of proving an\notherwise unacceptable proposition and shifts the burden of disproving it onto the interlocutor.\nReferences\nAnscombe, G. E.

Yet which policy best serves to reduce an unwanted behavior is\nalways an empirical question. Thus, those who adopt a zero tolerance policy towards some behavior without first\ninvestigating and finding that they are in a set of circumstances where that policy is the most cost-effective way\nof reducing or eliminating the undesirable behavior are committing the zero tolerance fallacy.\nKey words: argumentation theory, critical thinking, fallacy (or fallacies), rhetoric, zero\ntolerance\n1. Introduction\nThis short paper has two goals. The first is to convince people that, when people\nadvocate or adopt a zero tolerance policy, they are frequently committing a fallacy. The\nsecond is to stimulate people who suspect such a fallacy is being committed to accuse those\nthey think are committing the fallacy of committing the zero tolerance fallacy. What I am\nsuggesting, then, is that we add something to the rhetorician\u2019s arsenal: a newly named fallacy\nto hurl at opponents. I am aware of the downsides of suggesting this. As Quine observed,\n\u201c[r]hetoric is the literary technology of persuasion, for good or ill\u201d and it holds \u201cthe goal of\npersuasion above the goal of truth\u201d (1987: 183). I must therefore make at least a prima facia\ncase that, in this instance, more good than ill is likely to result from introducing the rhetorical\ndevice of the zero tolerance fallacy into our conversations about public policy.34\n34 I recognize that not all accounts of rhetoric (or all rhetoraticians) accept Quine\u2019s view that the discipline holds\npersuasion above truth. Though I note that Aristotle, the founder of the discipline, held this view.\n143 When an activity meets with widespread public disapproval and politicians or\nadministrators feel the need to react, they often adopt the rhetoric of \u201czero tolerance\u201d. The\nimplicit (and sometimes explicit) message is that, by adopting a zero tolerance policy towards\nan activity, one is doing all that one can\u2014at least all that one can qua policy adoption\u2014to\nreduce or eliminate the activity in question. Yet which policy or policies should be adopted to\nreduce or eliminate an unwanted behavior is always an empirical question, the answer to\nwhich will vary with the particular circumstances. And in many circumstances (indeed, in\nmost circumstances), adopting a zero tolerance policy (whether alone or in concert with other\npolicies and actions) is not the best way to combat unwanted behaviors. Thus, those who\nadopt a zero tolerance policy towards some behavior without first investigating and finding\nthat they are in a set of circumstances where that policy is the most cost-effective way of\nreducing or eliminating the undesirable behavior are committing the zero tolerance fallacy. Or\nso I will argue.\nI begin with a quick overview of the nature of fallacies, and I argue, in this case at\nleast, for a fairly narrow conception of what sorts of arguments should even be considered as\ncandidates to become named fallacies. I then say a few things about when we should name a\nfallacious argument. I then characterize the zero tolerance fallacy and argue that it is\nsufficiently common and sufficiently dangerous to warrant being included among those\nfallacies we name (and I argue for the name \u201czero tolerance fallacy\u201d). I follow this with a few\nremarks concerning why people commit this fallacy (and in the course of doing so seek to\njustify the first word in my title\u2014\u201cintolerance\u201d). I then turn to various objections and\nproblems. I close with a summary of the benefits that would accrue were the term \u201czero\ntolerance fallacy\u201d to become widely adopted.\n144 2. The Nature of Fallacies\nThere is a long tradition among those who study rhetoric and critical thinking to find\nand name particular fallacies. Aristotle observed that \u201csome reasonings are genuine while\nothers seem to be so but are not,\u201d and he used the term \u201cfallacies\u201d for those instances of\nreasoning that appear to be acceptable but in fact are not. 35 Aristotle, and especially his\nfollowers, went on to name several, thus turning fallacy identification and naming into\nsomething of an intellectual cottage industry. Galileo, who in general was not a friend of the\nAristotelians, offered a more liberal account of what a fallacy is, holding that any unsound\nargument\u2014any argument that fails to be both valid and have only true premises\u2014was\nfallacious. Thus, he writes:\nEither those who are to be persuaded are capable of understanding the\nreasons of Copernicus and others who follow him, or they are not;\nmoreover, either these reasons are true and demonstrative, or they are\nfallacious. If those who are to be persuaded are incapable, then they will\nnever be persuaded by the true or by the false reasons; those who are\ncapable of understanding the strength of the demonstrations will likewise\nnever be persuaded if these demonstrations are fallacious; so neither those\nwho do nor those who do not understand will be persuaded by fallacious\nreasons. Therefore, given that absolutely no one can be dissuaded from the\nfirst idea by fallacious reasons, it follows as a necessary consequence that,\nif anyone is persuaded of the contrary of what he previously believed, the\nreasons are persuasive and true. But as a matter of fact there are many who\nare already persuaded by Copernican reasons. Therefore, it is true both that\n35 On Sophistical Refutations 164a22.\n145 these reasons are effective and that the opinion does not deserve the label of\nridiculous but the label of worthy of being very carefully considered and\npondered (1615: 70).\nAn even broader use of \u201cfallacy\u201d occurs in a report of an incident between the\nGreenpeace ship Sea Shepherd and a Costa Rican shark-fishing boat. The Sea Shepherd\nSociety, responding to a claim that the Sea Shepherd had endangered the crew of the Costa\nRican fishing boat, wrote, \u201cthe video evidence proves this to be a fallacy\u201d. Here \u201cfallacy\u201d\nsimply seems to mean \u201cfalse claim\u201d.36\nThe contemporary literature on fallacies sides with Aristotle against Galileo,\nrestricting fallacies to a subset of invalid arguments.37 (The Greenpeace use is\u2014rightly in my\nview\u2014just ignored by contemporary critical thinking theorists as a case of overblown\nrhetoric.) Thus Gregory Bassham, William Irwin, Henry Nardone, and James M. Wallace, in\ntheir popular textbook, write that some \u201carguments are sound and convincing but many are\nfallacious. An argument is fallacious when it contains one or more logical fallacies. A logical\nfallacy\u2014or fallacy, for short\u2014is an argument that contains a mistake in reasoning\u201d (Bassham\net al, 2011: 119, emphasis in original).38 So a fallacy is a mistake in reasoning\u2014not just the\nacceptance of a false premise\u2014and a mistake that is unlikely to be noticed and hence is likely\n36 See http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/2012/05/13/captain-paul-watson-arrested-in-frankfurt-\ngermany-on-warrant-issued-by-costa-rica-1374 and http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18066901 (19.\nAugust 2012).\n37 Some logically valid arguments\u2014for example, petitio principii\u2014are fallacious. For simplicity I will ignore\nsuch cases here. A valid argument is one where, if all the premises were true, the conclusion could not possibly\nbe false.\n38 Galileo\u2019s position remains attractive. In a note to the above, the authors describe this as a \u201cnarrow definition\u201d\nbecause it excludes arguments with false premises.\n146 to be convincing. Joseph Heath puts the same point as follows: \u201cStrictly speaking, a fallacy is\nsimply an argument that takes you from true premises to a false conclusion. What makes it a\nfallacy, though, as opposed to simply a mistake is that a fallacy sounds right when you first\nhear it. In fact, it often requires considerable subtlety to see why a fallacious inference is, in\nfact, invalid\u201d (2009: 309). Unfortunately, Heath\u2019s way of putting it obscures the fact that even\nan argument with false premises may be fallacious. What he should have claimed\u2014and from\nthe context it is clear that this was his intention\u2014is that a fallacious argument is one such that,\nwere the premises true, it still could lead you to a false conclusion, and where, despite this\nfatal flaw, the argument seems to be a good one.39 So, we may say that an argument is\nfallacious when it is invalid but appears to be valid. And the better the fallacy (qua fallacy),\nthe more difficult it is to see that the appearance of validity does not correspond to the\ninvalidity of the argument.\nTrudy Govier adds another feature, saying that a fallacy is \u201ca common mistake in\narguing. It is a mistake in the reasoning that underlies an argument. The mistake can be quite\ndeceptive by seeming to many people to be just like correct reasoning\u201d (105, emphasis added).\nSo fallacious arguments that are common are called fallacies.\nWe now have three conditions for an argument being an instance of a fallacy: it\nmust be invalid, it must appear to be valid, and it must occur frequently. But not every type of\ncommon, deceptive, invalid argument becomes a named fallacy. For that to occur, the type of\nargument has to be plausible enough to appear to not be fallacious; it has to be plausible\nenough that it can pass as an instance of some type of good argument. An argument that is so\nobviously bad that no sane person would accept it does not get to be called an instance of a\nfallacy. Second, the argument has to be one that is used sufficiently often that it is worthwhile\nnaming it as a fallacy. This seems to be the standard used by the authors of most critical\n39 Heath rightly ignores cases such as begging the question that are both fallacious and logically valid.\n147 thinking textbooks. For example, in the very popular Oxford University Press textbook, The\nPower of Critical Thinking (Canadian Edition), by Lewis Vaughan and Chris MacDonald, we\nfind this:\nThere are certain types of defective arguments that recur so frequently that\nthey have names (given to them, in many cases, by ancient philosophers or\nmedieval scholars) and are usually gathered into critical thinking texts so\nstudents can become aware of them. Such common, flawed arguments are\nknown as fallacies, and they are therefore said to be fallacious. Fallacies are\noften beguiling; they can seem plausible. Time and again they are\npsychologically persuasive, though logically impotent. The primary motivation\nfor studying fallacies, then, is to be able to detect them so you\u2019re not taken in\nby them (2008:170-171, emphasis in original).\nA rarely used argument which seems to be genuine but which is not really so might count\nas a fallacious argument, but we would not call it a fallacy. This is because fallacies are\ncommonly used fallacious arguments\u2014indeed, those common enough to warrant naming them\nas fallacies. This use is employed even when one is not writing on argumentation theory, or\nrhetoric, or in core areas of critical thinking. Thus, Chris MacDonald, in \u201cCritical Thinking for\nBusiness Ethics\u201d, says that fallacies are \u201cerrors in reasoning [that] are so common that, over\nthe years, they\u2019ve been given names\u201d (2012: 33). In sum, uncommon errors do not get to be\nnamed fallacies.\nTo be fully accurate, one should say that named fallacies are arguments that would be\nfrequently used in the absence of a name for the fallacy. This is because, in naming a fallacy,\nthe hope of argumentation theorists, rhetoricians, and critical thinking scholars is to reduce the\n148 frequency of that type of reasoning. (That is also my reason for suggesting that \u201cthe zero\ntolerance fallacy\u201d be added to our collection of named fallacies.) But, if our standard were that\nsomething is properly a named fallacy only if its use is sufficiently frequent to warrant giving\nthe fallacy a special name, and if doing that were to substantially reduce the frequency with\nwhich people commit the fallacy, then by our standard we would have to drop the fallacy from\nour list of named fallacies (because, subsequent to naming it, its use would become infrequent).\nSadly there is no reason to fear that this worry is one worth holding. People have been naming\nfallacies since Aristotle\u2019s time and, so far as I know, there has never been a case where naming\na fallacy has been so effective in changing people\u2019s patterns of argumentation as to actually\nmake the fallacy extinct. The best that argumentation theorists can hope for in pointing out a\ncertain form of reasoning as fallacious is a modest decline in the use of that type of reasoning.\nConsequently, I will not worry that, by filling our critical thinking and argumentation texts\nwith warnings against using the zero tolerance fallacy, instances of that fallacy will become so\nrare that the fallacy is not one worth bringing to people\u2019s attention.\nDespite the foregoing standard for something becoming a named fallacy, I will use an\neven narrower standard. I will hold that we should add an argument form to our list of\nrecognized fallacies if, and only if, the argument is invalid, distinctive, plausible (in\nAristotle\u2019s sense of one that could easily be mistaken for a good argument), frequently used\n(or would be frequently used), and, finally, if its use frequently has significant harmful\nconsequences. By the last condition I am suggesting harm that goes beyond just that of having\npeople participate in erroneous reasoning. We already have a lot of named fallacies, and there\nis little reason for adding to our list if the form of fallacious reasoning causes little or no\nsocial harm. But use of common fallacious reasoning\u2014fallacious in that it meets the first\nthree conditions discussed above\u2014that does cause serious social harm warrants being given a\nname. We need to be able to briefly identify instances of reasoning which are not just\n149 substandard but which also lead to significant social harms when people are taken in by them.\nMy claim is that arguments of the type I am suggesting we call zero tolerance fallacies do\nmeet all five of these individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for warranting\nbecoming a new named fallacy.\nTo review, my conditions for adding a new fallacy to our collection of named fallacies\nare:\n- the argument type is invalid\n- it is a distinctive type of argument\n- arguments of this type are often plausible (or seem to be valid)\n- the argument type is frequently used\n- the argument type is one whose use causes significant harm.\nThe above constitutes a rigorous standard for adding a new named fallacy to our\ncollection. I will now characterize the fallacy I think we should name, showing that it\nmeets the first three conditions above. I will not, in this paper, defend the position that\narguments that I think should be called instances of the zero tolerance fallacy meet the last\ntwo conditions. I take the facts here to be sufficiently obvious for the reader to discern this\nfor herself.\n3. Characterizing the Zero Tolerance Fallacy\nA zero tolerance policy is one that automatically imposes a punishment for any\nviolation of a given social rule. Once such a policy is in place, those charged with enforcing\nthe policy are forbidden from using discretion as to whether observed violations of the policy\nare to be brought to the attention of those charged with punishing violators; and there is no\nprovision for the punishment to be lessened or altered to fit particular circumstances. The only\nissue that may legitimately be entertained is whether the rule was violated. If it was, then the\n150 fixed punishment is to be imposed. Almost always when zero tolerance policies are adopted\u2014\nthough this is not essential\u2014the offences are strict liability offences. Indeed, from here on I\nwill assume that the offences are strict liability ones. In addition, the penalty attached is\nusually thought to be severe relative to the offence that was committed.\nSometimes people adopt a zero tolerance policy for good reasons. They may judge that\nsome activity or behavior has harmful consequences (or is itself harmful) and that the best or\nmost cost-effective way to eliminate or minimize the behavior is to adopt a policy of zero\ntolerance towards that behavior. Reasonable people may well disagree about whether the\nbehavior is such that steps ought to be taken to reduce its occurrence, or they may think that\nhaving zero tolerance for such behavior is draconian. (For example, someone might advocate\na zero tolerance policy towards the possession of a drug. Others might think there should be\nno penalty attached to possession or consumption of that drug. Still others might think that\npeople ought to be discouraged from possessing and consuming the drug in question but hold\nthat a zero tolerance policy is simply too extreme a tool for dealing with the matter.) But we\ncan hardly hold that if such behavior is to be eliminated or reduced as much as possible, then\nadvocating the best or most cost-effective means of reducing that behavior necessarily\ninvolves the advocate in a fallacy. Nor am I interested in considering here those cases where\npeople disagree about whether a particular behavior is one we want to discourage. Our interest\nis in whether having a zero tolerance policy is an appropriate means to a social end, not\nwhether that end is one the society should seek to attain.\nRather, I am concerned with cases where a zero tolerance policy is adopted because,\nwhile it may seriously be believed that adopting such a policy is a good way to reduce the\nbehavior in question, there is no evidence, or there is inadequate evidence, to support this\nbelief (or those advocating the policy do not know of such evidence). In general, then, we can\nsay that one commits the zero tolerance fallacy when one advocates or imposes a zero\n151 tolerance policy towards some activity while lacking evidence for supposing that having zero\ntolerance for that activity will best serve to reduce the activity in question.40\n4. Motivation for Committing the Fallacy\nThe normal motivation for committing the zero tolerance fallacy is that officials think\nthey need to appear to be doing something to address a supposed problem. If some behavior is\nunwanted and nothing is being done by those responsible for regulating behavior in that area,\nthere is the concern that those responsible will be seen to be irresponsible. But adopting a zero\ntolerance policy against the unwanted behavior is an easy way to be seen to be doing\nsomething forceful to eliminate the problem. This is because the policy is simple and applies\nin an on-off way, with no need to weigh the details of particular cases. Furthermore, the stiff\npenalties attached to violations give the appearance that authorities are taking the matter\nseriously and doing something about it.\nBut a zero tolerance policy may turn out to be counter-productive. For instance, those\ncharged with carrying out the policy\u2014that is, with enforcing it\u2014may simply not enforce it, or\nit may be the case that their enforcement of it will be much more lax than it would have been\nhad some more reasonable policy been adopted. Suppose that, for some reason, parents come\nto fear that their children will be endangered if things that might be used as weapons are\nallowed at their children\u2019s school. (This is a perfectly natural and strong fear and one that\n40 Here I assume that evidence can, in principle, be obtained. Of course, I allow that the methods of providing\nsuch evidence\u2014statistical analysis, precedent, arguments by analogy, et cetera\u2014are likely to be quite varied. I\nam not sure what we should say about cases where evidence cannot be obtained, either because obtaining such\nevidence is impossible (as it might well be in some instances about the distant past) or because obtaining the\nevidence would violate serious ethical or legal protections of privacy needed to ensure that individuals can\npursue lives free from undue interference.\n152 sometimes hinders clear reasoning.) Suppose further that the school board or the school\nprincipal responds to these concerns by adopting the zero tolerance policy of forbidding\nstudents from bringing to school items that might be used as weapons. If those charged with\nenforcing the policy see the penalty attached as being overly severe, they may well not\nenforce the policy. They may simply pretend not to observe relevant violations of the rule,\nand in the end this practice may result in even less deterrence than there would be if a non-\nzero tolerance rule was in place to discourage such behavior.\nIn the case imagined above, if expulsion from the school is the penalty attached to\nviolation of the new rule and a child is discovered to have accidentally violated the policy,\nteachers or playground supervisors might just look the other way. Or they might enforce the\nrule differentially, based on some prejudice they have. Either way, their actions (or lack\nthereof) may serve to undermine the very purpose or aim for which the zero tolerance policy\nwas originally adopted. Things become much more complicated if children seize the\nopportunity to report on other children as a way of settling playground quarrels.\n5. Problems\nI now turn to several problems that arise from the idea that we should have a new\nnamed fallacy, the zero tolerance fallacy. First, and most obviously, the fallacy in a zero\ntolerance argument is often hard to identify because the fallacious argument is implicit. Most\narguments (at least as they are first presented) include implicit assumptions or hidden\npremises. Indeed, fallacious arguments are less likely to be explicit than fully developed\narguments are, for the simple reason that, once an argument is made explicit, it is often easier\nto determine whether it is fallacious (and, typically at least, those who employ fallacious\narguments either do not realize they are doing so or, when they are aware of this, they\ncertainly do not want their audience to know it). The typical argument for a zero tolerance\n153 policy is an enthymeme\u2014an argument with a missing or suppressed premise. And it is\ntypically this premise that lacks adequate support.\nWe might break this problem down as follows:\n1. Fallacies are arguments, and rarely is a full argument provided for adopting a zero\ntolerance policy.\n2. Such arguments as are provided for adopting a zero tolerance policy are almost always\nenthymemes.\n3. Enthymemes pose increased difficulties in interpretation.\n4. There are cases where there are valid\u2014indeed sound\u2014arguments for zero tolerance\npolicies. (And these have the same logical form as the fallacious arguments.)\n5. Sometimes we want policies or rules that are (in some sense) overly strict, and these\ncases are sometimes difficult to distinguish from others.\nBut we should note the following considerations that collectively weaken the objection. (The\nnumbers below respond to each of the numbered points above.)\n1. This is a standard problem with social rules\u2014rarely is a full justification offered. (This\nis so even in so-called hard cases of law where, typically, experts go to great lengths to justify\ntheir favored interpretation of a social policy or principle.41)\n2. The enthymeme is almost always filled in along the following lines: (i) we have this\nunwanted behavior; (ii) having zero tolerance for the behavior is the best way to\nreduce/eliminate the behavior; (iii) we have adopted (and put into place) a zero tolerance\npolicy regarding the behavior; (iv) therefore we are doing the best we can to eliminate/reduce\nthe behavior.\n41 Ronald Dworkin (1978: Chapter 4) distinguishes hard cases from clear ones operationally. A legal case is a\nhard case when reasonable people knowing all the relevant facts, including all the facts of institutional history,\ndisagree on the proper disposition of the case.\n154 3. Premise (ii) (or something like it) is almost always the one in need of evidential\nsupport. And it is almost always the one that lacks such support.\n4. Sometimes people have support for premise (ii) (or such support is easily available),\nand in those cases the fallacy has not been committed (or the charge that it has been can easily\nbe countered). Simply pointing out the existence of such evidence to those who object to the\nzero tolerance policy is generally a social good.\n5. In circumstances where we want simple absolutist rules, we also want flexibility in\nenforcing those rules\u2014precisely those circumstances where we do not want zero tolerance\npolicies.\nIt is, of course, an empirical matter how often there is a more effective approach\navailable to us to rid ourselves of a social ill than the adoption of a zero tolerance policy. At\npresent we often lack good empirical data regarding how frequently this occurs.42 Indeed, we\ndo not even know roughly what percentage of times zero tolerance policies are more or less\neffective than other options in even a limited area. (The articles by Wilson and Kelling (1982)\nand by Marshall (1999) are good places to start in reviewing the available data.) But this fact\nshould not be seen to be an undue hindrance to adopting the language I propose. For consider\nthe circumstances under which one is likely to claim that someone else has committed the\n42 Marshall (1999) contains a good discussion. Lacking solid data forces us to rely on the wisdom collected by\nothers. Perhaps most relevant here is Montaigne\u2019s observations about having zero tolerance for ending a\nmarriage. He observes that, \u201cWe have thought to tie the knot of our marriages more firmly by taking away all\nmeans of dissolving them; but the knot of will and affection has become loosened and undone as much as that of\nconstraint has tightened. And on the contrary, what kept marriages in Rome so long in honour and security was\neveryone\u2019s freedom to break them off at will. They loved their wives the better because they might lose them;\nand, with full liberty of divorce, five hundred years and more passed before anyone took advantage of it\u201d (1580,\nChapter XV: 320).\n155 zero tolerance fallacy (or to worry that one is committing it oneself). It is quite likely that\nsomeone will have either proposed or already have put in place a zero tolerance policy about\nsome activity or behavior. The opponent of this policy may object for roughly two types of\nreasons. First, of course, she may think that the behavior in question does not need to be\nrestricted, that there is nothing wrong with the behavior in itself and that it will not lead to\nnegative consequences (or, at least, not consequences that are serious enough to warrant\nrestricting someone\u2019s liberty). Second, she may agree that the behavior in question ought to\nbe reduced and simply think either that having a zero tolerance policy is likely to be\nineffective or that it is overly harsh (most likely because, in practice, it is almost certain to\nresult in punishing too many of those who, for one reason or another, ought not to be\npunished).\nIf the objection is really of the first type, the challenge is easily responded to simply by\npointing out that the objector disagrees with the end the policy seeks to reach, not with the\nmeans to that end. Advocates and opponents of the end in question can then get on with the\nmatter of debating that issue. If the objection is of the second type, the defender of the policy\nhas several options. She can offer data supporting the idea that, in this case, a zero tolerance\npolicy is more likely to work than other policies. This need not include sophisticated\nstatistical analysis, for such may not be available. Something as simple as \u201cWe have looked at\n[or have tried] other options and none of them seem to work as well as zero tolerance\u201d is\nsometimes all one needs to defend against the charge that one has committed the zero\ntolerance fallacy. But if the defender cannot offer such data or a compelling reason for\nthinking that in this sort of case the data is unlikely to be available, she and her supporters\nwill doubtless be prompted to look for such data. If, on the other hand, she does have such\ndata, then she has not committed the fallacy. Finally, in those cases where someone has\nadopted a zero tolerance policy without having supporting data that such a policy is more\n156 effective than other alternatives but she is able to quickly find such data\u2014so that the fallacy\nhas been committed\u2014then the finding and reporting of such data in response to the challenge\nthat she committed the fallacy shows that, in this case, committing the fallacy itself did little\nharm. Furthermore, the charge that the fallacy had been committed will have had the virtue of\nbringing to light relevant data about what modifies behavior in this type of situation.\nSo, in general, it seems that making the claim that someone who has adopted or\nadvocated a zero tolerance policy has committed a fallacy\u2014viz., the zero tolerance fallacy\u2014is\nlikely to have positive results. Either the disagreement will be seen to be about ends rather\nthan means, or if the end is agreed upon and the means are what is disputed, then both sides\nwill turn to the issue of finding evidence to support their positions. And, we can hope, the side\nwith the strongest evidential support is the one that will win that debate. Thus, we will be\nmore likely to have zero tolerance policies confined to those situations where they are\nsomewhat likely to accomplish what people hope they will.\n6. Good Zero Tolerance Arguments43\nI have been arguing that we need a new named fallacy, the zero tolerance fallacy. And I\nhave been seeking to characterize that fallacy. But one might think that I should have\nproceeded in a different way. Given that there are cases where there is good reason to adopt\nzero tolerance policies and given that there can be good arguments for adopting such policies,\nit would, in those cases, seem that the logical way to proceed would be to characterize the\nstructure of good or acceptable zero tolerance arguments, and then to characterize zero\n43 I am grateful to Leo Groake both for suggesting this approach and for pointing out the analogy that I consider\nhere. His \u201cLogic: Informal\u201d entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is a very useful place to start\nthinking about these matters. (See in particular the sections titled \u201cFallacy Theory\u201d and \u201cAn Example: Ad\nHominem,\u201d as well as the literature Groake cites there.)\n157 tolerance fallacies as cases that simply fail in some respect to live up to the standard of a good\nzero tolerance argument. An analogy is with ad hominem arguments. For years, indeed\ncenturies, logicians have treated these simply as fallacies. But since there are obviously\nperfectly good ad hominem arguments, some have recently suggested that we should seek to\nestablish what makes good ad hominem arguments good while identifying those ad hominem\narguments which fail to live up to this (as yet not fully developed) standard as instances of the\nad hominem fallacy. This approach strikes me as potentially quite fruitful. My reason for not\nusing it here is that it will almost certainly involve more than can be accomplished in a single\nshort paper. On this very point, the analogy with ad hominem arguments is again helpful:\nwhile we have many accounts of ad hominem fallacies, we are still working towards a full\naccount of what makes a successful ad hominem argument a good one. (For an interesting\nattempt along these lines, see Dahlman et al, 2011.) I would be extremely pleased if, in\naddition to making the idea of a zero tolerance fallacy a popular one, my work were to\nstimulate critical thinking theorists to work on the development of standards for successful\nzero tolerance arguments. That is a worthy goal, for then we could characterize arguments\nwhich commit the zero tolerance fallacy as simply those arguments which attempt to defend\nzero tolerance policies but which fail to live up to the proper standards (whatever those might\nbe) for being a good zero tolerance argument. However, it is important to note that we should\nnot tolerate bad zero tolerance arguments while we wait for argumentation theorists to provide\nus with an account of what constitutes a good argument for zero tolerance policies.\n7. Conclusion\nI am aware that \u201cto label the view of your philosophical opponent a \u2018fallacy\u2019 is, much\nmore often than not, a cheap rhetorical trick\u201d (Joyce, 2006: 152). Nonetheless, I hope I have\ndemonstrated that having something called \u201cthe zero tolerance fallacy\u201d as part of our social\n158 and political rhetoric would be, on balance, a good thing. In those cases where zero tolerance\npolicies are inappropriate, having a named fallacy would serve as a useful rhetorical device to\nmake this fact known in a simple and accessible manner. And in cases where one might allege\nthat the zero tolerance fallacy has been committed, defenders of the policy could easily\nrespond, and their responses would serve to move the discussion to just those areas that are\nmost likely to be productive of improved critical thinking about what social rules or policies\nwe should endorse. In the end, were we lucky, all of this might help reduce the unwarranted\nuse of zero tolerance policies and nudge the level of intolerance slightly closer to zero.44\n44 I am grateful for comments I received after presenting some of these ideas at the Days of Ivo \u0160kari\u0107 conference\nin Postira, Bra\u010d, Croatia (2012 April 20th) and from a generous anonymous referee.

Hansen, University of Windsor\nSummary\nA way in which argumentation workers can be of value to society and have their field of study and expertise\nrecognized is proposed: it is to make profiles of the argumentation behaviour of political parties during election\ncampaigns. The profiles are to be made in terms of concepts unique to the study of argumentation:\nargumentation schemes and dialectical roles, for example. The argumentation profiles will be of value to\nmembers of the voting public, as well as the political parties. Moreover, undertaking such empirical research\naffords an opportunity for argumentation workers to test the efficiency and adequacy of their concepts.\nKey words: argumentation worker, argumentation agent, argumentation profile, dialectical\nrole, dialogical role, dialogical position.\n1. Introduction\n1\nCan we argumentation workers be of any use to society? Yes, we teach many students to\nwrite, analyse and evaluate argumentation, and this undoubtedly makes them better at dealing\nwith arguments and ideas, and maybe even makes them better citizens. Still, our contribution\noverlaps with, and tends to be fused and confused with, the work done by our colleagues who\nteach history, civics, economics, grammar, politics, philosophy, psychology, and sociology,\netc. There is nothing wrong with that: education is about the integration of knowledge and\nharmonizing of skills. But that the original work of the argumentation worker gets put in the\nmix with that of so many other fields, all of which have a better known history and higher\nrecognition value, makes it hard for the public, and education programmers and\n1 \u2018Argumentation worker\u2019 is my term for those who work with arguments and\nargumentation (qua arguments and argumentation). Calling ourselves \u2018scholars\u2019 or \u2018theorists\u2019\nmay be saying too much; \u2018analysts\u2019 too little.\n163 administrators, to appreciate the fact that argumentation work constitutes a unique and\nimportant field of research and teaching. We need to show both the academic and the non-\nacademic worlds that we have an original and valuable contribution to make. I expect there\nwill be a number of different ways we can make our presence felt and appreciated. This paper\noutlines the suggestion that we promote ourselves through the development of what may\n(tentatively) be called argumentation profiles.\n2. Argumentation profiles\nAn argumentation profile is a description or characterization of argumentation behaviour over\ntime as exhibited by an argumentation agent \u2013\u2013 an individual or a group, party, or collective\nthat makes and takes responsibility for arguments.\nHow can argumentation profiles be of social value? Argumentation-behaviour is\nimportant for democracy: we want to elect people who will not only argue well, but also argue\nopenly, fairly, and productively. Past argumentation-behaviour encapsulated in an\nargumentation profile may be considered a predictor of future argumentation-behaviour.\nArgumentation profiles may also be a window through which we can come to\nunderstand an argument agent\u2019s true political attitudes. Richard Weaver, in his 1952 work,\nThe Ethics of Rhetoric (p. 55) wrote that \u201c[a] reasoner reveals his philosophical position by\nthe source of arguments which appears most often in his major premise because the major\npremise tells us how he is thinking about the world\u201d and that \u201ca man\u2019s method of argument is\na truer index in his beliefs than is an explicit profession of principles\u201d (p. 58). In other words,\n164 we can learn something about a person\u2019s political beliefs and deep-seated attitudes by looking\n2\nat the record of his or her argumentation.\nWeaver maintained that the eighteenth century political theorist, Edmund Burke,\nwhom we recall as a conservative, mostly used the argument from circumstance in his\nspeeches and writings, a kind of argument more appropriate to expediency and liberal politics\nthan to conservatism. In contrast he associates the argument from genus with Abraham\nLincoln, a kind of argument usually associated with conservatism and the status quo; yet\nLincoln is cherished as a pragmatic and liberal politician.\nSo, what we may take from Weaver is that the arguments agents make tells us\nsomething important, perhaps revealing and surprising about that agent. Below Weaver\u2019s\ninsight is extended by taking political parties as subjects, not just individuals, and by\nexpanding the number of indexes (beyond major premises) that can contribute to\ncharacterizations of argument agents \u2013 to profiles. The focus is on the profiles that can be\nmade of agents engaged in political argumentation, but profiles could also be made of\n3\nargumentation agents in other fields like science, law, and religion.\nSome people have identified a male way of conducting argumentation, and found it\nobjectionable. A generalization about the way men argue is implicitly a fragment of an\nargumentation profile of men. That there are such generalizations is an indication that there is\na rough, or intuitive, idea of argumentation profiles already at large. The present proposal\naims to give shape and character to such profiles.\n2 Weaver mentions four kinds of arguments: (i) the argument from genus or definition, (ii)\nsimilitude arguments, (iii) the argument from consequences, and (iv) the argument from\ncircumstance.\n3 See, e.g., Cassel (2012).\n165 A notable aspect of argumentation profiles is that they do not characterize argument\nagents on the basis of isolated argument behaviour \u2013 a particularly ingenious analogy, or an\natrocious fallacy, for examples \u2013 but on their argumentation behaviour over a period of time.\nThus, the import of profiles is that they will indicate how agents have been disposed to\nengage in argumentation in the past, and how they may be inclined to argue in the future.\n3. Concepts put to work\nAn argumentation profile of an argument agent should be based on an analysis of the agent\u2019s\nargumentation-behaviour over a period of time and executed in terms of concepts unique to\nthe study of argumentation. Thus, when making profiles of argumentation behaviour in\npolitical contexts it is not the usual issue-oriented categories we need such as views on the\neconomy, education, energy, the environment, and health care. The concepts needed for\nargumentation profiles will be quite different. They do not have to do with policies or\nplatforms, or party philosophies. Which concepts in particular will be useful for making\nprofiles is something we will have to find out through experimentation, but it is reasonable to\nbegin by testing some of the concepts argumentation workers already have to hand.\nDoug Walton and I have finished one pilot study of the argumentation in political\n4\ncampaigns, and we are now engaged in a second one. Our work is similar to that of William\nBenoit who has studied the argumentation in the nomination acceptance speeches by\npresidential candidates in the United States from 1960 to 1996. In one study three basic\nfunctions in the speeches were recognized, which were distinguished as acclaiming, attacking\nand defending.\n4 We studied the Ontario provincial election held in September-October 2011 (see Hansen\nand Walton, 2012b), and we are now gathering data on the provincial election held in Alberta,\nMarch-April, 2012.\n166 Themes that portray the sponsoring candidate or party in a favorable light are acclaims.\nThemes that portray the opposing candidate or party in an unfavorable light are attacks.\nThemes that explicitly respond to a prior attack on the candidate or party are defenses.\n(Benoit 1999, 254)\nBenoit\u2019s leading research question was, \u201cWhat is the relative frequency of use of the functions\nof acclaiming, attacking and defending?\u201d (P. 253) He found that the Democratic Party\nnominees engaged in acclaiming slightly more than the Republican party nominee did (77%\nto 68%) but that the roles were reversed when it came to attacking (30% to 23%) as well as\ndefending (16% to 3%). Clearly, Benoit\u2019s interests and approach are consonant with our\nprogramme of creating argumentation profiles by studying the argumentation behaviour of\nargument agents. Our approach differs from his, however, in that we focus on arguments as\nthe basic of unit of interest.\nIn our first study, Walton and I sketched profiles on the basis of which kinds of\narguments and dialectical roles were utilized most frequently by the agents. In our second\nstudy we are modifying and enlarging our inventory of argument kinds and roles, and adding\nsome other categories whose utility we want to test. We are experimenting to find out which\nfactors and categories can contribute to the making of useful argumentation profiles. The\nfollowing list of concepts is being considered:\n1. Argument kinds: The primary classification tool we have is a list of kinds of arguments,\nalso called argument schemes. The schemes are, roughly, definitions of different kinds of\narguments. A comprehensive list of the kinds of arguments that occur in political\nargumentation will help shape a picture of an agent\u2019s inclinations in argumentation. In our\nfirst study we used the basic inventory of schemes identified in Walton\u2019s Fundamentals of\nCritical Argumentation (2006), and we will use the same list again, modified in light of what\n167 we learned in that study. The kinds of arguments we identified, in descending order of\nfrequency, were these:\nNegative Consequences, Practical Reasoning, Positive Consequences, Argument from\nSign, Fairness, Direct ad hominem, Inconsistent Commitments, Popular Opinion,\nAnalogy, Commitment, Position to Know, Ad Hominem Circumstantial, Misplaced\nPriorities, Authority, Classification, Explanation, Values, Argument from Alternatives,\nCause to Effect, Correlation to Cause, Sympathy.\nIn constructing argumentation profiles, one looks to see which kinds of arguments are\npreferred by the argument agent.\n2. Pragma-dialectical argumentation schemes: It is also possible to classify arguments\nbroadly on the basis of the kind of conduit they provide from premises to conclusions.\nPragma-dialectical theory offers a three-fold classification in this category: symptomatic\nargumentation, instrumental argumentation, and similarity argumentation (van Eemeren and\nGrootendorst 1992: 94 ff.). Even though there are only three \u2018schemes\u2019 here they have the\nadvantage that they are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive, or at least appear to be so.\n(The same cannot be said for the informal logic schemes: with them it is possible that an\nargument could instance two schemes, and then a decision has to be made about which\nscheme is the better fit to the argument.) Nevertheless, because there are only three schemes\nin this typology, we can only expect very general information to come from this classification.\nBut, as before, one is curious to see if an argument agent prefers one kind of scheme to the\nothers.\n3. Aristotle\u2019s pisteis: Aristotle\u2019s three artificial means of persuasion might also give us some\ninsight into the argumentation proclivities of agents (See Rhet. 1356a). We will attempt to\nclassify arguments on the basis of whether it is logos (appeal to evidence), ethos (character) or\npathos (emotion) that is brought to bear.\n168 These first three categories of classification (kinds, schemes, pisteis) have to do with\nthe internal nature of the arguments themselves \u2013 they are ways of classifying either the kind\nof reasons brought to bear, or the way that the reasons are related to the conclusion. It is also\npossible to study the external (relational) properties of arguments in an ongoing political\ndiscussion, in particular to consider the roles, or functions, of the arguments in the ongoing\ndiscussions.\n4. Dialectical roles: Argument agents have purposes they want to achieve by the use of their\narguments and thus the arguments are instrumental to their ends. Hence, given a context like\nthat of a provincial or national election, arguments may be seen as being used for certain\npurposes by the agents in the argument exchanges. These purposes can be classified and\naccordingly arguments used may be seen as playing a role. There is no determinate list of\nends arguers have in using arguments, and so no determinate catalogue of roles has been\nestablished. Walton and I felt free to invent a short list of four dialectical roles which we\nnoticed recurring in the data of political campaign arguments. These were the policy-positive\nrole (used to defend a statement or policy), the policy-critical role (used to criticize a\nstatement or policy), the person-critical role (used to criticize an opponent rather than his/her\nposition), and the defensive role (used to deflect criticisms). After reading Benoit (op. cit.)\nwe added a fifth by dividing his category of acclaiming into positive and negative roles,\nallowing us to add a person-positive role.\nStudying an argument agent\u2019s choice of roles will tell us something not only of\nhis/her/ its resources, but also about the possibilities it sees for advancing its cause. The\nanalysis of dialectical roles must, however, be tempered by the following two dialogical\nconsiderations.\n5. Dialogical roles: Is an argument being used to initiate discussion of an issue, or is it a\nresponse-argument, made as a reply or alternative to an argument or policy already before the\n169 public? My hunch is that response arguments are more likely to be cast in a negative role\nthan arguments that introduce a new topic or policy. But it is not impossible that a response\nargument has a positive role or that an initiating argument has a negative one. This is a factor\nto take into consideration when constructing argumentation profiles.\n6. Dialogical position: Whether an argument agent is the incumbent party or a challenger\nestablishes his/her/its dialogical position, is something which may well affect the choice of\ndialectical roles an agent gives to arguments. My inkling is that an incumbent party is more\nlikely to have occasion to use the defensive role, clarifying misinterpretations, and defending\npolicies. Challengers we would expect to be on the attack, being critical of both policies and\nincumbents. Of course, both sides will likely make arguments in all the roles, but certain\nroles may predominate for an agent during the course of a campaign. In sum, in constructing\nthe argumentation profiles, both the dialogical positions of the agents, and the dialogical roles\nof their arguments, must be taken into consideration.\nThe above concepts present themselves as being of interest to argumentation workers\nwho attempt to make argumentation profiles. To illustrate the kind of analysis we have in\nmind, consider the following example taken from the Alberta provincial election this spring.\nIn this example, the party in power, the Government, is being criticized for proposing\na new law that would impose \u201cpenalties on drivers with a blood-alcohol concentration\nabove .05\". In response the Solicitor General made this argument,\nThis [law] targets people who habitually drink and drive, . . . When similar legislation\nhas been enacted elsewhere, it has had the effect of reducing the amount of alcohol-\nrelated injuries and fatalities on the road. (Calgary Herald, 2012.)\nThis is an interesting example because it is both clear and complicated. It is indicative of the\nkinds of challenges our research will face. It is clear because it immediately told us that\n170 because of the presence of the word \u2018similar,\u2019 this is an Analogical Argument; however, both\nthe minor premise and the conclusion are unstated, and so we reconstruct the argument as\nfollows (placing the elements added in reconstruction inside square brackets):\nIn other jurisdictions, imposing penalties on drivers whose blood alcohol\nconcentration exceeds .05 per cent has had the effect of reducing the number of\nalcohol-related injuries and fatalities on the road;\n[Our jurisdiction, Alberta, is relevantly similar to the other jurisdictions];\n[So, imposing penalties on drivers whose blood alcohol concentration exceeds .05 per\ncent, will have the effect of reducing the number of alcohol-related injuries and\nfatalities on Alberta roads.]\nThe sample also presents a complication since although it is an Argument by Analogy, it is\nalso a case of Practical Reasoning: an end is specified as desirable (\u201c reducing the number of\nalcohol-related injuries and fatalities on Alberta roads\u201d) and a means is proposed (\u201c imposing\npenalties on drivers whose blood alcohol concentration exceeds .05 per cent\u201d). We are then\nleft with a case in which one argument is an instance of at least two schemes. If we want to\nhave a one-to-one match of arguments with argument kinds, however, we will have to make a\ndecision. In this case, I am inclined to treat this as being an Analogical Argument for the\nreason that in the context of political election campaigns a great many of the interchanges\nconcern practical affairs, and therefore what will be of interest from the point of view of the\nempirical study of argumentation is the various ways that politicians encapsulate their\npractical reasonings about how to deal with the matters of concern. Let us then consider our\nexample to be of the kind, Analogical Argument.\nAs an analogical argument our example is an instance of the Pragma-Dialectical\nsimilarity scheme. (If one considers it as belonging to the argument kind Practical Reasoning,\n171 then it will be an instance of the causal argumentation scheme.) The argument is best\nclassified as an instance of the logos means of persuasion since there is no appeal to either\ncharacter or emotion in view. The dialectical role of the argument is to defend a policy; the\ndialogical role is that of response, and the dialogical position is that of the incumbent.\n4. Illustration\nElaine Cassel has \u2018profiled\u2019 the argumentation behaviour of members of the United States\nSupreme Court during the recent hearings about Obama-care. She found, through looking at\ntheir argumentation behaviour, that some of the judges showed empathy and compassion for\npoor people, some were of even temperament, some showed an authoritarian approach to\nlegislation, some kept their politics out of their argumentation and stuck to legal arguments,\nsome remained aloof from the fray. Cassel claims to have learned something about the judges\nby studying their argumentation (see Cassel 2012).\nSuppose we obtained the following result for three parties in a given election:\nPriority rankings Party A Party B Party C\nARGUMENT KINDS Practical reasoning, Negative consequences; Fairness;\npositive consequences; direct ad hominem; Analogy;\nfairness misplaced priorities Sympathy\nPD SCHEMES instrumental Symptomatic similarity\nPISTEIS Ethos Logos pathos\nDIALECTICAL ROLE policy +; person +; person \u2013 ; policy +; policy +; person \u2013;\ndefensive policy \u2013 person +\n172 DIALOGICAL ROLE response; initiator initiator; response initiator; response\nDIALOGICAL Incumbent Challenger challenger\nPOSITION\nWhat might we say about these results? We might venture these thumbnail sketches:\nParty A: Problem-solution oriented but balanced with considerations of fairness; depends on\ncredibility of agent; stresses the advantages of own policies and leadership; corrects\nmisinterpretations and deflects criticism.\nParty B: Depicts incumbent party as having bad policies, and attacks character of its members;\nwants to establish alternative goals; sees policies of government as indication of corruption;\nappeals to statistics and public opinion; puts priority on criticizing opponents over promoting\nown policies; initiates lines of discussion (criticism) more so than responding to the ideas of\nothers, indicating an attempt to control the discussion.\nParty C: Primarily concerned with social justice; makes case by drawing comparisons to other\nmore vivid injustices; appeals to sympathy of electorate; initiates lines of argument stressing\nvalue of its own policies and is somewhat critical of incumbent and other opponent; tries to\nchange agenda to discuss its own issues; depicts itself as having a high moral character.\nNotice that these argumentation profiles are descriptive, not evaluative. Some\nargumentation workers would go further and, from a distant point of view, evaluate the\narguments and argumentation of each of the agents, and thus create an evaluative\nargumentation profile of agents. Christian Kock, for example, urges that the argumentation of\npoliticians should be evaluated from the point of view of whether it meets the needs of the\nvoting public in its quest to make an informed decision at the ballot box (Kock 2011, 14).\n173 However, until the methodology of making argumentation profiles is better developed it may\nbe advisable not to take a position on the quality of individual agents\u2019 argumentative\nbehaviour because that can be interpreted as partisanship and sink our scientific aspirations.\nInstead we should lay out our findings in vivid and accessible detail, letting the public make\nof it what it will. My anticipation is that, properly packaged, we can catch its eye.\n5. Summary\nI began by suggesting that one way in which argumentation scholars could distinguish their\nwork from that of their colleagues, and show their usefulness to society, was to construct\nargumentation profiles of politicians\u2019 behaviour during election campaigns. I have suggested\nsome of the concepts that could be the building blocks of such profiles. Why are such profiles\nof value?\nA. Value to voters. Voters may want to take profiles into consideration when making their\ndecisions at the ballot box: not only do we want to support politicians who advocate policies\nwe approve of, we also want to elect people who will conduct themselves in an intellectually\ncapable and responsibly manner if they are elected. Profiles can be an indicator of future\nargumentation behaviour.\nB. Value to political parties. Political parties will be interested in their own profile as well as\nthose of their opponents. This is especially so if the public takes the view that they want their\npoliticians to behave in an intellectually responsible manner, they will want to know how they\ncan improve their own profile and how they can take advantage of their opponents\u2019\nweaknesses as revealed in their profiles.\nC. Value to argumentation workers. Profiles of parties (or individual politicians) can be\ntailored for consumption in the public media, e.g., newspapers, radio, television, blogs, etc.,\n174 either during a campaign or shortly afterwards, as long as public interest endures. This is a\nway to bring the work of argumentation workers to the attention of the public. Walton and I\n5\nhave done this. To this end one will find using the broader more intuitive categories like the\ndialectical roles, most suitable. In general, the greater public doesn\u2019t care to distinguish three\nkinds of ad hominem arguments.\n6. Externalities\nArgumentation profiles can contribute directly to the quality of political life by providing\ninformation that is vital to political parties who are argument agents, and to citizens who must\nevaluate those parties. There are, in addition, a number of spin-offs, or externalities, of doing\nargumentation profiles that can be felt within the academy.\nD. Inter-disciplinary cooperation. Argumentation workers need the cooperation of at least\nthree other fields in order to make argumentation profiles sound and valuable. (1) These\nprofiles will profit from being supplemented with communication factors which take into\naccount other components: tone of voice, posture, choice of language, etc; hence,\ncoordination with communication workers with complementary interests will make the\nargumentation profiles more valuable. (2) Our analyses can be enriched by the participation\nof social psychologists, people who study personality, group behaviour, and social cognition.\n(3) Creating profiles of political behaviour invites participation and cooperation with\ncolleagues in political studies. We should engage the cooperation of workers from these other\ndisciplines, but keep the argumentation profile as the central, unifying component.\nE. Concept testing. What argumentation theorists themselves should find valuable about this\nkind of study is that it allows them to test their concepts. This is especially so for the list of\n5 See Hansen and Walton (2012a).\n175 informal-logic argument schemes and the dialectical roles. Whereas text books look for\narguments they can use to illustrate schemes, we look for a list of schemes that will be\nadequate to the identification and classification of all the arguments in a given field of\ndiscourse. What is optimal here? We need a balance between what is useful and manageable.\nThis means that the list of argument kinds (schemes) should be comprehensive enough to\nallow classification of all the arguments found in the discourse, but it should not be so fine-\ngrained that it will introduce minute distinctions that have little or no consequence for the\nmaking of argumentation profiles.\nF. Student participation. Student participation in gathering, classifying and analysing the\narguments used in the creation of the profiles is important for at least two reasons. The one\nhas to do with the user-efficiency of the concepts and methods of informal logic. If these\ncannot be used by university students at the upper undergraduate level, or the beginning\ngraduate level, then we have lost sight of an important goal of informal logic viz., to provide\ntools of analysis and evaluation useful to the public in general. In gathering the information\nneeded for making the profiles, we can observe how well our students do with the materials\nwe provide for them to work with, and make adjustments as needed The other reason to have\nstudent involvement in the making of the profiles is to stimulate interest in election campaigns\namong young people. Only 38 per cent of the 18-24 age group voted in the 2011 federal\nelection in Canada. (Edmonton Journal, 2012)\nThis completes my case for seeking the involvement of fellow argumentation workers\nin the study of political campaigns, and the value of making argumentation profiles.\nReferences:\nAristotle.

Polish parliamentarian debates on the future of the EU\nAgnieszka Kampka, Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW\nSummary\nThe analysis of the Polish parliamentary debates on the Euro zone crisis indicates in what ways politicians use\nmetaphors to construct the situational definitions. The paper shows the common area of the three notions of the\nrhetorical situation, definition of the situation and the persuasive definition. It serves to answer the question,\nwhat factors influence the way of presenting the given aspects of reality in the public speeches. The examples of\nthe metaphors used in the debates are recalled in the context of the functions that similes may play in the\npolitical discourse.\nKey words: metaphor, rhetorical situation, crisis, parliamentary debates\nDemocracy assumes that people may disagree both as to the ends and the means of\naction. Tough social situations, such as an economic crisis and increasing discord in meta-\nstate institutions make differences and conflicting views more evident and visible. There are\ndifferent ideas in the society as to the ways of solving problems. In addition, the differences\nare also present in the definitions of the problems. Therefore a debate is a key issue in a\ndemocracy. Differences of opinion result often from a different understanding of reality, since\nwe consider its fragments in different contexts and have disparate criteria of evaluating the\nactions we took.\nHowever, if democracy assumes a drive for agreement, for finding a satisfactory\nsolution for all \u2013 it is necessary to present one\u2019s point of view in a clear fashion as well as a\nproposed course of action. It is mandatory to define a situation as a starting point, as well as\ndetail the conditions and give a name to that which is going on or is about to happen. In order\nto prove that signing of a fiscal pact is a good solution can be done only after we have\n178 demonstrated that the situation requires signing of such a pact. Political action largely\ndepends on the ability to provide meaning to significant people, events or processes.\nThe following analysis of the parliamentary debates is an attempt to answer a question\nin what way a specific rhetorical device \u2013 a metaphor \u2013 is used by politicians when they\ndefine the situation. The objective of the analysis contains the selected debates concerning the\neconomic crisis and the Future of the European Union, which were held in the Polish Seym in\nthe years 2008-2011. The research question concerns first of all the functionality of the\nmetaphor in the political discourse, as well as its usefulness in the main task a politician faces\ni.e. imposing on others their own interpretation of events, and the understanding of facts and\nprocesses.45 The economic crisis forces politicians to make quick decisions in a situation of\nmany unknowns. Political leaders today \u2013 as Giandomenico Majone (1992) rightly said \u2013 can\nonly utilize arguments in favor of competing hypotheses rather than hard data. Therefore, an\nimportant question to pose in the analysis of political rhetoric concerns the tools used for\nconstructing a definition of the situation. How can politicians justify their choice of one of the\nfuture hypothetical scenarios? How do they argue that the interpretation of reality which they\npropose is correct, and thus their decisions also are appropriate? One of the tools used for this\nis a metaphor. Analysis of metaphors used in political discourse have repeatedly shown that\nthey can serve for constructing political myths, can be a part of argumentative strategies\n(Charteris-Black 2005), and the expression of an adopted model of the world (Lakoff 2004).\nThe question is whether they may also serve as an indicator of ritualization of political debate?\nDispute can be described as a \"ritual chaos\" (Czyzewski et al. 1997). It is a type of discussion,\nwhere despite sharp expressions, all roles and arguments are known and remain unchanged. It\nis thus difficult to speak of a real debate, rather than a ceremonial skirmish.\n45 The quotations appearing in the text were taken from the stenographic records found in the webpage of the\nPolish Seym, www.sejm.gov.pl\n179 What is the situation definition? What are its components and what impact does it\nhave on the rhetoric strategy of the speaker? \u2013 these are the questions that define the structure\nof the first part of the investigation. The second part is concentrated on the features of the\nmetaphors that make them effective in the political discourse. Eventually there are examples\nof concrete metaphors used by Polish politicians while describing the Euro zone crisis.\n1. How is the situation defined?\nThe competition of various definitions of situations is the crux of political action in the\ndemocratic system. Parties and politicians convince citizens that their interpretation of events\nis accurate and if the diagnosis is right then the remedy they propose is also correct. Defining\nthe situation is the first step in a successful persuasion exercise. We are not concerned solely\nwith the recognition of the factual circumstances of the speech. What is more important is the\nsignificance that the speaker or the audience attributes to the circumstances.\nRhetoric analysis of the public discourse or the public debate always requires very\ngood knowledge of the context. As we read in Theaetetus: \u201cWhatever each city judges to be\njust and fine, these things in fact are just and fine for it, so long as it holds these opinions\u201d\n(Plato, Theaetetus 167 c 4-5). That sentence indicates the significance of the situation\ndefinition in political rhetoric. \u201cThere is nothing more elusive than an obvious fact\u201d Sherlock\nHolmes used to say and it has to be admitted that it is absolutely true in reference to political\nlife. Explaining what it is that we see, and what is the name of the things going on, thus\nimposing one\u2019s own definition of the situation on other participants of the public life, is one\nof the key activities of politicians. When we think of the term of situation definition and refer\nit to a concrete rhetorical situation a number of necessary elements have to be considered. In\nrhetoric and social sciences there are three concepts which seem to be mutually\n180 complementing each other. These are: rhetorical situation, definition of situation and\npersuasive definition.\nWhat shall we consider a rhetorical situation? In the most concise approach we mean\nthe context in which a given utterance is presented and received. \u201cNot the rhetor and not\npersuasive intent, but the situation is the source and ground of rhetorical activity\u201d Lloyd\nBitzer explains (1999: 220). It is the situation that defines the way of speaking. Who the\nspeaker is, what social role he/she plays, the nature of the audience and the time and place \u2013\nthose are the factors construing the rhetorical situation. Thus when we speak of rhetorical\nsituation, we mean specific historic circumstances. In the analyzed debates that context was\nout of necessity created by the economic crisis, that hit the Euro zone, decisions that the\nleaders of the EU states took, aiming at the reduction of the effects of the crisis and the\nnecessity to define what actions the Polish government should have taken (or already has\ntaken) considering the circumstances. Of no lesser importance there was the arrangement of\nthe Polish political scene, as well as the interests and needs of the political parties. Also the\nlevel of support they received from the voters as well as the timeframe for the elections. The\nanalyzed debates took place in different timeframes: in the middle of the Seym\u2019s term, several\nmonths before its completion but still before the official beginning of the election campaign\nas well as in the beginning of the new term. It seems natural that the debates become more\nheated the closer the date of the elections. Similarly the first sessions of the new parliament\nare rich in lively discussions, since our envoys (or new political groups) are eager to present\nthemselves as active and significant political forces. The debates which were analyzed were\nnot particularly exciting. There were several factors responsible for it. First, direct effects of\nthe crisis were not yet particularly felt by the Poles. True, there was already present a general\nawareness of the crisis, but particularly dramatic situations were absent and thus did not\nprovide the material for emotionally loaded narratives or moving examples. Secondly, Poles\n181 are generally in favor of the EU, supporting further deepening of the integration process.\nSome later studies showed that the opinion was divided as far as the commitment of Poland in\nthe aid to the crisis stricken countries (CBOS 2012), but the debates took place at the time,\nwhen the information on the fiscal pact just began to appear in the public debate. That is the\ntime when the public opinion on the subject started to coalesce. That obviously created an\nopportunity for the politicians \u2013 a skillful definition of the situation would allow that\ninterpretation to appear in the media and then in the public opinion. And \u2013 it is a third\nimportant factor \u2013 the Union issues do not seem to be the main bone of content in the Polish\npolitical scene. The concepts of Poland\u2019s role in the EU do not constitute the basis for\ndifferentiation of the political parties. As it is well known, political rhetoric is the most\nspectacular only when it is strongly related to the identity of the given party (Kampka 2009).\nRhetorical situation it is actually all that is contained in the mutual relations between\nthe speaker, the audience, the topic of the speech and the circumstances of its delivery. The\nrhetoric is \u201cessentially-related-to-situation\u201d, as Bitzer explains. Rhetorical situation is also\nclosely connected with interaction ritual (Goffman 1967). The speech is the response to the\nsituation; rhetoric \u201cchanges reality through the mediation of thought and action\u201d (Bitzer 1999:\n219).\nThe analyzed debates present undoubtedly the cases of exigence \u2013 the economic crisis\nrequires fast decision making, the MPs demand from the government full information on the\nactions taken and the effect of it is the debate called: current information. The place in which\nthe concrete opinions are expressed influences what is being spoken as well as the way it is\nspoken. The plenary sessions of the Seym, radio and TV transmission of the debates, the\nattention of the media \u2013 all those elements influence the rhetoric choices of the speakers.\nSome of the most influential factors are related to the social roles performed by the\nbroadcasters. Political rhetoric is highly ritualized, and, as a result \u2013 the verbal behaviors are\n182 quite predictable. If the head of the government speaks, most certainly he will concentrate on\nproving that the decisions of the cabinet are justified, while the representative of the\nopposition will focus on arguing that they are not.\nThe next important notion we discuss is the definition of the situation, a term used by\na sociologist, William Thomas. It is a sort of mutual agreement that all participants of the\ninteraction have adopted. That sociological definition of the situation is close to the\nsuggestions of Kenneth Burke, for whom the function of rhetoric is exactly an appropriate\nnaming or defining of what the given situation is (Burke 1969: 206). The speaker (sender)\nuses rhetoric in order to select, from the surrounding plethora of objects, principles, and\nevents the ones whose properties correspond to meanings he/she would like to focus on. The\nobjective of fitting properties and meanings together is to make the listener accept the\nunderstanding of the situation presented by the speaker. We can see it in this simple example.\nWe have an apple vendor, who advertises them to the customers. On a hot day he speaks of\ntheir juicy nature and how they can quench the thirst. A young mother is being persuaded that\nthe apples contain lots of vitamins and that they are very healthy. To an elderly gentleman the\nvendor praises their softness and to the housewife he recommends his apples as the best kind\nfor the apple pie. Apples have also many other features \u2013 they are round, red or yellow, have a\nsoft or tough skin, they are sweet or sour \u2013 but rhetoric is the matter of choice. Situation\ndefinition turns out to be a negotiation of mutually accepted meanings important for the both\nparties in the communication situation. The matter is similar in the case of the economic crisis.\nIt does not matter then if the prime minister has a good rapport with his ministers and plays\nball with them, but what matters is his ability to make decisions quickly and accurately.\nAction is possible only when we have interpreted the situation and have defined what it really\nis so that we will be able to behave accordingly. Meeting a group of people in the street we\nmake an instant decision as to the fact that those are tourists who lost their way and ask for\n183 help in finding their way to the city center, or a gang of sports fans willing to express their\nanger for their team\u2019s defeat. Definition of the situation turns out to be one of the basic human\nactivities in social contacts.\nFrom the vantage point of the political rhetoric it is particularly important to consider\nthe consequences of the adopted definition. Independently of the fact of whether the situation\ndefinition is true, the effects of its adoption are always true. If we interpret the behavior of a\nyoung man approaching us in the street as a threat, we will start running regardless of the fact\nthat he wanted only to ask us what time it was.\nLet us check how it works in a political situation. On April 10, 2010 Poland\nexperienced a trauma of a great magnitude \u2013 the presidential plane crashed in Smolensk in\nRussia. Almost a hundred of the most important persons in the country perished, including the\npresident and his wife, generals, MPs, high level state officials and representatives of many\ninstitutions and organizations. The interpretation of this event still splits the Polish society and\nthe political scene. In the public discourse two totally different narratives are present. The first\nassumes that the catastrophe was an ordinary airplane crash, the causes of which are being\ninvestigated by a special commission. According to the other definition of the situation that\ntragedy had been planned and it was an assault against President Kaczynski. The\nconsequences of adopting one of the versions result in definite type of behavior. People, who\nare convinced that it was an assault see the present president and prime minister as traitors,\nwho want to push the truth under the carpet. In effect they organize protests and\ndemonstrations demanding full exposure of the truth.\nAnd thus in the case of the interactive definition of the situation words create the\ncircumstances. The situation is the effect of the words used. What was uttered produces\nconcrete deeds which change reality. And though it might seem that the two terms rhetoric\nsituation and the situation definition exclude each other, in the language of politics they are\n184 complementary. A speaking politician expresses specific words on the one hand because he\nmust utter them (he is a prime minister or the leader of the opposition etc.) but on the other\nhand he utters them because he wants to achieve something, to influence the audience.\nThe third important concept we want to discuss is the persuasive definition. It is a type\nof a definition, which provides a presentation of the case that is the most advantageous to the\nsender (Walton 2007: 275). Charles Stevenson was the one who developed that notion by\npaying attention to the specific emotional and descriptive dimensions of words. In the\npersuasive definition we focus on the emotional effect that the given word produces. Hence\nprecious are the metaphors here, which have the ability to invoke emotional associations.\nNaturally we may ponder the effectiveness of identifying the persuasive definitions, since\nstrong arguments can be mustered in favor of the view that all definitions are persuasive.\nThey are always biased, after all, since they depend on the choice of which species properties\nwe will define as distinctive. Both Cicero (1942: II, 109) and Quintilian (2005: VII, 3, 15-18)\nstated that since the use of the definition serves a definite purpose, in consequence it is always\npartial to a degree, and since its objective, first of all, is to convince the listeners, it must\ncontain some emotional and narrative elements. It is the common sense that provides the\nliminal condition here. It is worth remembering that Cicero wrote about three means of\npersuasion; that what matters is 1. That we prove that what we defend is true, 2. That we\nconvince those that are listening to us, 3. That we direct their emotions in a way that supports\nour cause, \u201dthe proof of our allegations, the winning of our hearers\u2019 favor, and the rousing of\ntheir feelings to whatever impulse our cause may require\u201d (Cicero 1942: II, 1152). And the\nuse of emotions is a key factor in identifying a given definition as a persuasive one.\nPersuasive definitions used in the language of politics bring with them extremely\nimportant legal or financial consequences. The change of the definition in the law results in\nthe change of the qualification of the deed, as it is shown in the case of analysis of the term of\n185 rape (Zarefski 2006) or wetland (Schiappa 2003). Therefore persuasive definitions should not\nbe treated as unimportant language tricks, since they are one of the most powerful instruments\nof politics (Walton 2007:281). In addition those definitions span bridges between facts and\nvalues. In the case of the persuasive definition words happen to be the effects of the speaker\u2019s\nintention, their objective is therefore the change of the situation through the transformation of\nthe receivers\u2019 attitudes.\nSumming up then, in the rhetorical situation words are the effects of circumstances, it\nis the situation that influences the rhetorical choices of the speaker. In the interactive\ndefinition of the situation to the contrary \u2013 it is words, i.e. the naming of the reality, that is the\ncause of the new situation created. It is worth remembering that the way of perceiving the\nreality and its interpretation does not happen out of nowhere. There are also present\nsituational conditionings. They depend on the identity of individuals and social roles\nperformed by them as well as on the time and place, they also depend on the receivers. A\nperson lurking by the window with a sack on his back may be interpreted as Santa Claus, if he\nis seen in December by a four-year-old through his room\u2019s window, or as a thief if in another\nseason he is seen by a janitor in a storage area. It is evident that in spite of the apparent\ncontradiction both terms, the rhetorical situation and the definition of the situation, have\nsomething in common. Similarly we can find a common element in the persuasive definition.\nWhile it is formulated it must take under consideration the circumstances, which might\nfacilitate or hinder the acceptance of that definition by the receivers.\nAnd thus, in order to analyze the definition of the situation, which politicians construe\nin their pronouncements, it is necessary to consider all three discussed terms in their scope of\nmeanings, since the phenomenon we are discussing is located exactly in the field common to\nall those areas.\n186 2. What is a metaphor in politics\nActors participating in the public debate use metaphors in order to illustrate ideas and\nviews. It is possible to speak of the double role of the metaphors depending on to whom they\nare addressed. Metaphors, on the one hand, are a sort of identification signs, pointers that\nallow for an instant recognition of the sender and at the same time construct the sense of the\ngroup\u2019s community (Charteris-Black 2005: 205). Similar to the graffiti on the walls which\npoint out who rules the district, metaphors used by a given political milieu provide clear\nsignals of the unity of their attitudes to the members. On the other hand the metaphor\naddressed to the external world serves as a visible and convincing presentation of a given\ntopic. Naturally most often the same metaphor performs both functions simultaneously. The\ndebate on the expos\u00e9 by Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz can serve as an example\nhere. He assumed power in 2005 on behalf of the Law and Justice party (PiS), which\nproclaimed the need of fundamental renewal of the Polish public life. He used a metaphor of\nthe state as a gambling table, where politics, businessmen, special services functionaries and\ngangsters play bridge. The metaphor turned out to be catchy and other politicians and\njournalists used it often. For the supporters of the party it was a clear cut brief of the program\n\u2013 it is necessary to overthrow the table and return to the concept of the common good, when\npolitical activity is a service and not a dirty play aiming at promoting private interests at the\nexpense of the citizens and damaging to the state. This simple image was supposed to\nconvince those hesitant ones to accept the definition of the situation, i.e. the diagnosis of the\ncondition of the state according to PiS. Metaphor is a convenient tool in political polemics,\nsince it is difficult to deny or to undermine it. In the example above the opposition had\nembarked on such an attempt \u2013 it used the same metaphor to convince the voters that although\nthe players change the table still stands and the proclaimed renewal of the state is just a\n187 pretense. The above example clearly indicates how important a role the metaphor plays as an\naid in defining the situation.\nRhetoric analyses may be seen as a test in what way we persuade others by means of\nsymbols, as well as how symbols influence people (Schiappa 2003: 3). Metaphor is a specific\ncarrier of symbolic meaning, therefore in the studied political utterances it is treated as an\nelement of the argument and not the embellishment (ornatus). Therefore the analysis of the\nmetaphors used by politicians must respond to the same questions we answer when we try to\ndefine the situation. Thus it concerns all the issues covered in the theory of stasis (Lausberg\n2002: 67-87). We are talking about the issues concerning the identity of the participants of a\ngiven debate. It also concerns the limitations presented by the given rhetoric genre.\nIt is worth pointing out that in the case of economic crisis and the future of the EU the\nclassic questions of status coniecturalis, definitivus, qualitatis (i.e.: is it there? what is it?\nwhat is it like?) bring in many potential answers. Moreover in contemporary politics we often\ndeal with the phenomenon defined by the ancients in reference to the court trial. We mean a\nstatus finitionis, which is an attempt to find a name for what has happened (Cicero 1993: De\ninv. I, 8, 10). The correspondence between a thing and a word is an important issue in the\npublic discourse. Contemporary law provides sanctions for unsubstantiated use of certain\nterms. Therefore sometimes the use of a metaphor may be an attempt to avoid penal\nresponsibility. Calling the prime minister a pitiful clown is quite a different matter than\npresenting a picturesque image of a circus, in which an ignorant clown usurped the place of a\ndirector, even if the only possible interpretation of that image is the recognition that the state\nis the circus.\nA metaphor is a complex phenomenon. We may view it both as a linguistic\nphenomenon, as well as a cognitive one (the thriving practice of cognitive analysis of the\nmetaphors is a proof). We may study its emotional dimension but also its socio-cultural\n188 ramifications. We may analyze in what way a metaphor corresponds to a given fragment of\nreality or follow the merging of separate fields, by means of which it is possible to explain\nsomething what is new through a reference to something already known, or we may have a\nrevealing look at something already well known but presented in a different than usual light\ndue to the metaphor. A metaphor is a main supportive frame of the communique since it is\nable to structure ideas. It is also a very useful tool in constructing persuasive definitions, since\nit exposes or conceals selected contents (Charteris-Black 2005; Cameron and Maslen 2010,\nMusolff and Zinken 2009). In this connection it is worth remembering that in the case of\npolitical rhetoric quite often we deal with a situation in which a new, initially effective\nmetaphor loses quickly its persuasive thrust and by overuse becomes sterile and thus of\nnegligible cognitive and visual value, as such cases were analyzed convincingly by Michael\nBiling and Katie MacMillan (2005).\nIn the debates I have chosen I was interested in the metaphors playing important roles\nin arguments of both sides of the conflict regardless of the degree of the metaphor \u2018s\ncomplexity. Additionally the devices used by the politicians I treat as intentional actions\nrather than as an expression of subconsciously coded cultural patterns or ideological schemata.\nNaturally it is necessary to consider the fact that such factors as political orientation,\nbiography or upbringing influence stylistic and cognitive choices made by politicians. It is\nalso worth considering that in political rhetoric it is usually more important who listens than\nwho speaks. Biblical analogies in the mouth of the conservative politician may be closer to\nthe imagination and value system of his potential voters than himself. Therefore the cognitive\napproach attempting to answer the question what a given metaphor changes in the way of\nthinking is useful first of all in the studies of communication effects. Hence, in the cases\nreferred to below it matters more to find the connection between the image used and its place\nin the adopted argumentative tactics (Plantin 2009).\n189 3. How to define crisis?\nIn analyzed debates the participants were representatives of the parliamentarian clubs\nof the most important Polish parties. The coalition government is made up of the two parties;\nCitizens\u2019 Platform (PO) and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL). The first one is the center liberal\nparty universally associated (although not necessarily reflecting the actual facts) with young,\nentrepreneurial citizens, rather than with wealthier urban inhabitants. PSL is a traditional\nagrarian party. Law and Justice (PiS) the largest opposition party, a conservative rightist party,\nin conventional wisdom (again not necessarily squared with the truth) representing the\ninterests of the losers in the Polish transformation, inhabitants of the poorer regions of the\ncountry. Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) or the Palikot Movement (RP) did not play any\nsignificant role in the analyzed debates, since they are pro-EU parties, supporting the\nEuropean policy of the government. The main line of contest runs between PO and PiS. Both\nparties, sharing the same roots in the Solidarity movement and formerly planning to form a\ncoalition, at present are locked in a dire conflict, both in the policy program areas as well as at\nthe personal level (Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the leader of PiS, is a twin brother of the late\nPresident, and he is accusing the government of the incompetent carrying out of the\ninvestigation of the Smolensk plane crash). PiS, although generally supportive of the EU,\nperceives Poland\u2019s role in the EU differently than PO does.\nFrom the parliamentarian enunciations metaphors referring directly to the crisis or the\nEU have been selected. In the analyzed material metaphorical descriptions of the EU of an\nunequivocally positive kind appeared only twice. The prime Minister spoke of \u201ca great,\nbeautiful European adventure\u201d, while Robert Biedro\u0144, one of the opposition MPs (in the pro-\nUnion Palikot Movement), explained that \u201cthe European Union is a mutual dream not of 500\nmillion Euro but it is a dream of 500 million Europeans\u201d.\n190 As far as depicting the crisis is concerned, metaphors presenting the economic crisis as\na natural catastrophe appear more frequently in the government\u2019s rhetoric. The opposition,\nhowever, focuses on the presentation of the Euro zone crisis as a faulty edifice. It has, quite\nnaturally, a very simple justification. Presenting the crisis as a turmoil, a flood, a storm or a\nquake the government explains that the events which the European countries are battling now\nare as equally unexpected and unexplainable as the climatic phenomena. The role of the\nauthorities is to counteract the negative effects of those conditions. It is worth remembering,\nthat the metaphor style concerning the wide range of natural disasters or diseases is an\nimportant element of the political rhetoric, particularly in the cases of strong ideological\ncontests \u2013 there is often talk of the flood, fire, fever or pestilence. To a large extent it was\nused by President Truman at the time of the Cold War (Ivie 1999). The objective is always to\nbuild up the tension and the exploitation of emotions. The threat perspective produces\nreactions different than the usual ones, among them greater than usual license for quick\ndecision making by the rulers. It is then easy to give up regular democratic procedures of\ndebate, justifying it with the necessity of an immediate response. Such mechanism could be\nobserved after 09.11, mainly in the USA. The opposition metaphors suggest, on the other\nhand, that there is somebody responsible for the crisis, it is possible to point out an\nincompetent architect, hence the images of \u201ca poorly constructed edifice, of the European\nhome erected on quicksand\u201d. This last image, evoking the evangelical parable in the mouth of\nthe rightist envoy assumes an additional meaning, since the audience (and particularly\nsupporters of the party) are used to the opinion that the EU is an institution whose activities\nare far from the conservative or Christian values, and often openly hostile to them.\nThe metaphor of the EU as a home is used also by the government side, which is\nexplaining that implementation the opposition\u2019s vision would put Poland in a cul-de-sac, or\nwill remain in the anteroom and in the draft. The metaphor of the common home, household,\n191 marriage is universally used in the discourse on the EU (Musolff 2006). The metaphor of the\nEU as a home according to Paul Chilton and Mikhai Ilyin (1993) has been started by Michail\nGorbachov with the statement made in the mid-80s about the common European home in the\ncontext of mutual responsibility of the states for Europe.\nLet us have a look at the metaphors used in the debates. Different metaphors imply\ndifferent ways of dealing with things, Norman Fairclough comments (1989: 120). If the\nproblem rests in the faulty foundations of the building, it needs general renovation. If the\nproblem rests with an incoming tornado, escape might be the only rational action. Naturally in\nthe analyzed cases those two solutions did not materialize since, as I said, the metaphors did\nnot serve as ways of looking for solutions but as the method of identifying the culprits.\nSimultaneously that example indicates another important feature of the metaphors \u2013 their\ncustomary character. Almost each metaphoric image may be used in many different ways.\nLet\u2019s return to the image of the state as a building. We may pay attention to the foundation of\nvalues, on which the state is posited or stress the open door for immigrants (Fairclough\n1989:120). The choice of a given aspect depends on the situation and the sender\u2019s intention.\nOne of the more frequent images is the one of a boat/ship. All parties accepting the Union\npolitics of the government use this metaphor although they use it in many different ways. EU\nmay be a \u201cnavy ship\u201d, which cruises in the stormy sea and it should be aware of other ships in\nthe ocean - such as America or Asia. Poland may be \u201ca ship\u201d which is sailing \u201csteadily\u201d in\n\u201cthe rough seas\u201d. Those are pretty standard descriptions of the economic crisis, rough seas is a\nclassic image presenting a difficult situation, uncertain, very challenging particularly as the\nspeed and accuracy of decision making is concerned.\nFinally it can be said of the EU that we are \u201call in one boat. In this boat we will either\nmake it or we will all drown, and there is still a group of candidates waiting in the wharf,\nmany countries, not only Croatia, but also the Western Balkans\u201d. This picture serves the\n192 purpose of justifying the sense of solidarity, which all Union countries displayed, and which\nfinds its expression in the financial assistance obligations. Those examples prove the\nuniversality and the repetitiveness of political images in general. In research on the metaphors\nin German politics and media debates in the years 1989-1990 the words of similar meaning\nranges have been compared, i.e. to boat and ship. Used in metaphorical expressions they\nevidently service different aspects of events. The ship appears in references to complex\neconomic projects, the reference is made to the ship sailing in rough seas. While the boat is\nused in two contexts. Firstly, as an illustration of the expression \u2013 \u201cto be in one boat\u201d, which\nmeans the mutuality of interests, and the other one \u2013 that metaphor appears in the reference to\nthe newcomers \u2013 the country is like a boat; we have limited space and there may not be room\nfor all (Zinken 2006).\nIn Polish debates the image of a ship appeared in one more context: Poland may be a\nship but so could any other country, since the most important thing is that in \u201cthe captain\u2019s\nbridge there stands\u201d a leader of the political party supported by the citizens. The topos of a\nship has been developed through centuries in the European culture \u2013 at its early beginning\nthere is the Biblical Noah\u2019s Ark, thanks to it humanity survived the deluge, as well as the\nNew Testament\u2019s Peter\u2019s boat, whose rumple is firmly held by the succession of the popes. In\nthe Renaissance literature there were frequent juxtapositions of the serene farmer\u2019s life versus\nthe dangerous and risk-laden life of a sailor, crossing the rough seas. In the Polish literature\nthe motif of a motherland as a mighty ship had been extremely popular with the call for all\nhands on deck cooperating for keeping its due course, while during the partitions and the loss\nof independence the image transforms into a vision of a sinking vessel. In one of the\ndiscussed debates Prime Minister Tusk used that metaphor as a means of political fight. \u201cThe\nleader of the opposition woke up and shows courage in TV spots (\u2026) You know what,\npresident Kaczynski, I \u2018ve seen many brave men in spots and ads (\u2026) but the leader of the\n193 political formation is required to stand fast on the captain\u2019s bridge when citizens handed him\nthe right and a chance of exercising power\u201d. As it appears the position on the bridge has to be\nseen as a counter to the fake courage that can be demonstrated in the political ad. Juxtaposing\nsomething true and fake is a permanent rhetorical device used by politicians.\nThe next example of contradicting reality and appearance can be found in the\nmetaphor of a remedy. The economic crisis and turmoil in the EU are treated as a disease that\nhas to be cured. The opposition speaks of harmful effects of the drugs used so far, i.e. the\nrescue measures adopted by the European leaders. The Prime Minister treats the opposition\u2019s\nideas with disdain: \u201cYou want to look for prescriptions, you want to help , so go and look for\nthem there where they can be found in order to use the remedy to fight the disease, and not\nsimply because somebody had an idea. We cannot afford to use fake instruments\u201d. The career\nof the word true in the political discourse is still another matter well presented particularly by\nthe language of the propaganda researchers (Klemperer 1992, G\u0142owi\u0144ski 1991).\nWe often deal with the image of a feast, sitting at the same table. Contrary to the\nappearances it is a complex metaphor. The government speaks of the danger of transformation\nof the Union into an exclusive club for the wealthiest, and explains that it is not evident to\nevery member state, that all countries should sit at the same table \u2013 some believe that the\nfunctional criterion must be the membership in the Euro zone. In this approach sitting at the\ntable does not necessarily mean a feast but rather the possibility of participating in the\nnegotiation. An elaborate image presented by one of the envoys of the opposition, it refers to\nthe perception of the EU as the source of luxury and welfare.\nThe MP explained that to lend money to the International Monetary Fund from the\nbudget reserve was like \u201cpaying insurance fee for a house in which we do not live, in order to\nrelieve wealthier neighbors, because we will participate in the decision making on the menu\nof their dinner and maybe we will deliver some produce from our garden and will have the\n194 honor to clean the table after that\u201d. In those sentences there is contained the attitude towards\nthe EU characteristic of many milleaux. On the one hand the Union seems to be something\ndesirable and good (after all those are the wealthy neighbors), but on the other hand as\nsomething unjust, harmful and hungry for costs and funding. In spite of the irony in this\nimagery there rings an echo of the subordinate position of our country.\nThe only way to deny a metaphor is to find a new interpretation of the same image. It\nis attempted by a later speech of the parliamentarian of the ruling coalition who, referring to\nthe above mentioned sentences, said: \u201cMP \u017by\u017cy\u0144ski helped himself with the following\nmetaphor: why should we insure the house from fire if we do not live in it? But it happens. If\nthe houses are located next to each other, it may be proven that buying insurance on the house\nnext to us might be prudent, because being adjacent when it goes on fire my house may burn\ndown, too\u201d. It is clearly visible how subtly the initial metaphor is transformed in order to\nserve the new objectives. First there was a talk of a dinner not a fire. If contributing to the\nmeal of the wealthier neighbors seems absurd then paying for the fire insurance, which might\nalso threaten us, does not seem to be so senseless any longer. The well known principle\noperates here \u2013 the perspective of our own benefits changes the sense of the whole situation.\nOne of the oppositionist parliamentarians opposing the definition of the situation proposed by\nthe government explained that \u201cIt is not one table and one menu\u201d, while another MP\ncriticizing the government\u2019s activities during the Polish presidency maintained that Poland\nproved itself only as a hostess arranging for \u201cmeals, meetings and hotels\u201d.\nThe imagery which connects the Union politics with feasting seems to be well\nestablished in the imagination of the Poles. The roots of those metaphors can be found in a\nsymbolism of power, which is of very ancient provenience. Since the times of organized\nsocial groups the privilege of those in power was their access to food. Wealth and power,\nsince times immemorial, regardless of the period and cultural model, were always\n195 demonstrated, inter alia, by festive meals, what still finds its echo in ceremonial dinners or\nsuppers held by the heads of state to honor the invited guests. Thus power in the everyday\nimagery is related to the access to economic privilege. It is demonstrated in the colloquial\nidiom, that a person aspiring to the high office \u201celbows oneself to the feeding place\u201d.\nThere is still vivid \u2013 originating in the Polish People Republic period \u2013 a\ncommonplace notion of the wealthy West, although polling research shows that migrations\nsignificantly modified the image of the European \u2013 from quite an attractive creature he/she\nbecomes slowly \u201ca human being like myself.\u201d\nAnother element of the EU image is its financing source potential. It is characteristic\nthat the public opinion polls systematically indicate that those who perceive their material\nsituation as a good one are more satisfied with the EU membership. The use of the Union\u2019s\nfinancial aid is seen as one of the greatest benefits of the integration. A majority of the Poles\nare in favor of the EU, and place a lot of trust in it and its institutions \u2013 74% of the Poles\ndeclare trust in the EU, although they have relatively scant knowledge of its institution at the\nsame time (CBOS 2009). Maybe a following principle is in operation here \u2013 I trust the one\nwho brings benefits to me and if everything goes well, I do not need to go into the details of\nthe operation. The Euro zone crisis and the fiscal pact draft indicate the fallacy of that\napproach. We must still remember that the addressees of the public speeches are the people\nfor whom the Union is still a certain abstract being.\nThe opposition, according to its basic argumentative strategy, proclaiming that the\ngovernment\u2019s activities led/ are leading to the partial loss of sovereignty, is using the\nmetaphor of a client or sidekick. Poland \u2013 as the audience should read that image \u2013 gives up\nits role as an active player, an important actor in the international scene, and the aspirations of\nthe rulers are limited to the winning of favors from the powerful patron.\n196 Polish politicians also use typical imagery concerning movement. The economy is a\nliving organism which can \u201cget winded\u201d, or it may \u201cslow down\u201d, and venture capital can \u201cget\nrampant\u201d. Also the metaphor depicting the EU as a vehicle is connected with movement. The\nvehicle must be \u201cprevented from skidding\u201d, therefore Poland should act as a \u201cdriver of change\u201d\nand not as \u201ca brakeman\u201d. The brakeman \u2013 he is a popular character in the Polish political\ndiscourse, most frequently the president is accused of being one when he vetoes the bills.\nIt is worth pondering on the source domains of the heretofore mentioned metaphors.\nGenerally they are closer to the everyday (or even closer \u2013 the physical) experience than more\nabstract target domains. Both the Union and the crisis are the abstract notions. Hence the\nmetaphors used by politicians serve cognitive purposes to a large degree; they help to\nestablish a certain structure, as it happens to be in the analyzed case \u2013 the rather ill-defined\ncrisis. The metaphors of the building, of a natural disaster or a feast are naturally much closer\nto the everyday experience of the audiences. The only exception is the metaphor of the\nboat/ship \u2013 navigation is not a commonplace in Poland, but the familiar nature of this activity\nis the result of the linguistic idiom. As I have mentioned already, the topos of the motherland\nas a boat/ship is one of those most often used in Polish literature, which is the basis of school\neducation, therefore those images are immediately recognized as such. For the same reason\nthe analyzed metaphors are the conventional ones, the use of which is well grounded in the\nlanguage (Kovecses 2011:194). Their conventional nature to a certain degree limits the\nrhetoric choices of the speakers. The language community often imposes the way in which the\ngiven matter is discussed (the case of the boat/ship metaphor is a good example).\nUndoubtedly the choice of the metaphor is related to a large degree with the ideological\nembedding of the given political party. Brock et al. indicate, using American politics as a\nreference, how the ideological profile of the person influences the rhetorical choice strategy\n(Brock 2005, 85n). In reference to the Polish conditions it makes sense to recall three\n197 examples. Conservatives use an idealistic perspective, making reference to the individual\u2019s\ncharacter or the acting person. The elements of such a strategy we can find both in the\nopposition politicians\u2019 enunciations (PiS) as well as in the ruling coalition. Liberals in their\narguments often refer to situational factors; action is determined by the circumstances. Such\narguments appear in the speeches of PO envoys. And finally the radicals point to the\nstructural conditions. In the analyzed debates it is assumed that the source of the crisis rests in\nthe systemic weakness of the EU and the capitalist economy.\n4. Unused potential?\nSumming up, metaphors used in the analyzed debates belong to the standard imagery\nrepeatedly appearing in the political discourse. None of them have become so influential that\nit would dominate the debate. Nevertheless they constitute a part of the argumentative tactics\nand serve the purpose of intensifying the message. They are not constitutive, however, of the\nargument itself, and do not explain something that is totally unknown. They perform an\nillustrative function instead \u2013 in the cases of more elaborate images. Most of the analyzed\nexamples cannot be defined as rhetorical figures in the full sense of the word, although\nundoubtedly they are metaphorical expressions. It is still in accordance with Cicero\u2019s\nexplanations, who by connecting the particular value of metaphors with their sensualism, i.e.\nmaking references to specific senses (first of all the sight), explained that sometimes it\nsuffices to use a word to activate a given sense (Cicero 1942: III, 161). Due to that the\nmessage is much clearer. Quintilian explains that the use of metaphors is particularly\napplicable when the metaphorical word is better, more expressive or more decent than the\naccurate one (Quintilianus 2005: VIII, 6, 5-6). In the analyzed debates the MPs most often\nused the simile due to its expressiveness. It is worth remembering though, the qualification\nthat the value of the metaphor (as well as all other figures) depends on its functionality.\n198 Let us ponder the criteria of the metaphor\u2019s effectiveness, since it is the metaphor\nwhich imposes the interpretation on others that is the most desirable for the politicians. Such a\nmetaphor should meet some conditions, nevertheless. It is good if it can appear in the\nbeginning of the pronouncement and should not be too complex. Too many details make the\npicture less clear. It should also provide a fresh look on things, or a new solution, but at the\nsame time refer to the everyday experiences of the audience. The New Testament\npresentations of God\u2019s Kingdom may serve as examples here. When Christ speaks of the\nvineyard, sheep or the olive tree in the parables, he uses images extremely close to and well\nknown in the experience of his listeners. And at the same time those metaphors serve to give\nthe human mind real and acceptable shape for the transcendental concepts.\nIn the analyzed debates, it seems, politicians do not use the full persuasive potential of\nthe metaphors. They use them somehow unawares (to the extent that in the parliamentary\ndebates we deal with a non-reflexive use of any construct\u2026). None of the recalled examples\nwas a spring for a further debate. In particular, the economic crisis did not spur the politicians\nto the creative use of the language. However, it is beyond doubt that metaphors used by\npoliticians function as instruments in constructing the situation definitions, which are\nconnected with the whole argumentative strategy of the party. As it is evident, metaphors may\nperform many functions in political discourse. First of all they serve the purpose of\nsimplifying the abstract and complex issues in order to make them comprehensible for the\npublic. Metaphors help in formulating an expression worth quoting (sound-bite). They\nproduce humorous effects. Their generalizing and equivocal nature is very useful (Semino\n2008: 84). In the analyzed debates the cognitive role seems to be the primary one. Images\nwere used to facilitate comprehension of difficult decisions, and also provide the vision of the\nalternative to the indefinite future.\n199 The metaphor is used to build the definition of the situation; it helps policy-makers to\njustify an undertaken action. Selection of a particular image association that politicians want\nto impose on the public depends on a variety of factors that make up the rhetorical situation:\nThe time of occurrence, roles played by the politician, current image, collective identity of the\nparty\u2019s members and supporters. One of the most important is undoubtedly the position of the\nparty on the political scene. The main differences in the choice of metaphors are not\nassociated with the ideological axis (e.g. left-right as Lakoff [2002] described), but rather the\naxis of the government and the opposition.\nStrength of the metaphor is based on surprise, ability to show a new perspective. In the\ndebates which have been analyzed not only were the metaphors conventional, but it was also\neasy to predict who and at what point uses them. So what is their true task? It seems that the\nkey role of metaphor is one of a rhetorical prop in the ceremonial dispute.\nReferences\nBillig M. and K.

The analysis includes the usage of\nideologically marked words, expressive terms with emotional value, and figures of speech, particularly metaphor.\nCorpora for this research were political speeches broadcast on television and radio collected over a period of 3\nmonths, including the most important political figures of the previous and the present government as well as\nrepresentatives of \u201cEurophobes,\u201d such as leaders of right wing political parties and civil organizations. The main\ngoal of the analysis is to determine what kinds of arguments are frequently used, which fallacies are most\nfrequent, and what are the differences and similarities in rhetorical means and argumentative strategies between\ntwo opposed sides? Analysis showed very weak argumentation and frequent use of appeals to emotions,\nespecially appeal to fear, for both supporters and opponents to EU.\nKey words: argumentation, fallacies, political discourse, Europhobes, Europhiles\n1. Introduction\nCroatia, which was formerly part of the Republic of Yugoslavia, gained independence in 1991.\nIn 2003 it applied for membership in the European Union and in early 2004 the European\nCommission recommended Croatia be granted candidate country status. By mid-2004 the\nEuropean Council granted Croatia's application for candidate status. Membership negotiations\nofficially started in October 2005. They were concluded on June 30th 2011 and followig the\nsigning of treaty on December 11th 2011, Croatia officially became the 28th member of the\nEuropean Union.\n204 The negotiation process between Croatia and the EU has been the longest in EU\nhistory, and was complicated for various political reasons, amongst them the extradition of\nCroatian citizens (in particular, certain individuals who had been Generals in the Croatian\narmy during the war 1991-1995) to the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. The EU\nrequired the Croatian government to cooperate with the court as a necessary condition for a\ncontinuation of the negotiation process. On one occasion, the EU postponed the\ncommencement of negotiations because the Croatian government\u2019s effort to capture a fugitive\nCroatian general was deemed insufficient. Another reason for the lengthy duration of the\nnegotiations was the Croatia-Slovenia border dispute which resulted in Slovenia blocking\nCroatia\u2019s EU accession for 10 months. Political issues such as the above have had a deep\nimpact on the perception of the EU among Croatian citizens. Ultimately, a referendum was\nheld on January 22nd 2012 which resulted in 66% of the voters being in favor of Croatia\njoining the European Union.\nThis paper analyzes political speeches of both supporters and opponents of Croatian\nmembership in the EU. The majority of Croatian political parties supported EU membership.\nThe opponents were radical right wing parties and right extremists so far not elected to\nparliament, as well as other representatives of civil organizations. Political analysts widely\nagreed that the public debate about an EU membership was insufficient and that the period\nbetween the finalization of the negotiation process and the referendum was too short for an\nexchange of opinions between EU opponents and supporters. Moreover, opponents\ncomplained about a lack of media coverage with respect to their own efforts to raise\narguments against Croatia joining the EU. Although outnumbered in parliament, Europhobes\norganized meetings and gatherings in public places which received media coverage and thus\nprovided data for this research.\n205 2. Materials and methods\nFor the purpose of this research, we used political speeches broadcast on three national\nCroatian television channels (HRT, RTL, Nova TV), as well as political statements and\ninterviews in two daily newspapers (Jutarnji list, Ve\u010dernji list) over a period of 3 months\n(June and December 2011, and January 2012). Data were selected on the basis of political\nrelevance and media presence (i.e., the speeches of the most important political figures in\nCroatia including the president Ivo Josipovi\u0107, the former and the current prime minister,\nJadranka Kosor and Zoran Milanovi\u0107, respectively, as well as the former and the current\nminister of foreign affairs, Gordan Jandrokovi\u0107 and Vesna Pusi\u0107 (all four of whom can be\nregarded as EU supporters). Opponents of EU included leaders of right wing parties Daniel\nSrb and Ru\u017ea Toma\u0161i\u0107, as well as activists, and representatives of civil organizations, for\ninstance Roko \u0160iki\u0107, \u017deljko Sa\u010di\u0107, Marko Franciskovi\u0107 etc.).\nThe analysis conducted in this paper was based, on the one hand, on Critical Discourse\nAnalysis (CDA) which encourages the critical study of discourse within its discursive-\nhistorical context of production (van Dijk, 2001) and, on the other, on rhetorical analysis\nwhich aims at extending CDA beyond lexico-grammatical analysis by introducing an\nargumentation component.\nThe study of political discourse in the terms of language analysis was conducted for\nthe first time after World War II when linguists tried to understand and explain the roles and\nimportance of language and communication in totalitarian regimes and their propaganda.\nThey demonstrated how political discourse is determined by society in what may be termed \u201ca\nsocial practice\u201d (see Wodak and Meyer, 2012: 17).\n206 Our method is similar to that used for analyzing the discourse of proponents and\nopponents of the Iraq war (Sahlane, 2012) which also combined CDA and rhetorical\nargumentation analysis.\nCritical discourse analysis included the examination of vocabulary, especially the\nusage of ideologically marked words (e.g. Euroslavia), the usage of expressive words with\nemotional value (e.g. national consciousness, independence), and figures of speech, especially\nmetaphors (such as tunnel of darkness or the light at the end of the tunnel). The rhetorical\nanalysis was primarily oriented to rhetorical argumentation and aimed at tracing differences\nand similarities in the means of persuasion used by opponents and supporters of Croatia\u2019s EU\nmembership.\nTindale (2004: 20) explains rhetorical argumentation:\n\u201cRhetorical argumentation draws features from the rhetorical tradition and mixes them\nwith newer innovations. For the core of what the tradition provides, another Aristotelian triad\nis useful: that organization of the rhetorical that distinguishes ethos, pathos and logos. The\nprocesses of rhetorical argumentation meld together these three bringing into relief and\ninextricably wedding to one another in the argumentative situation, the arguer, audience and\n\u201cargument\u201d. To understand the argumentation is to understand the interactions of these\ncomponents; to evaluate argumentation is to do the same.\u201d\nBased on previous research on a similar topic (Sahlane, 2012), we assumed that\nappeals to emotion, especially the appeal to fear (argumentum ad metum) and pity (ad\nmisericordiam)\u2014would be frequent. Johnson (2000) has emphasized that in order to be\neffective, the rhetoric used in mass media needs to take human emotions, in particular fear\nand pity, into account. O` Keefe (1996) mentions these in relation to persuasion short cuts.\n207 Appeals to fear and pity work as persuasive arguments using the dual process model of\npersuasion. \u201cAccording to this model there are two routes of persuasion, a central and\nperipheral route. The central route requires an elaboration of the rational argumentation in the\nmass of evidence in a case. But appeals to fear and pity offer a short cut to a mass audience by\nsuggesting a peripheral route.\u201d (cited after Walton, 2007: 128)\nPut generally, we assumed that ethos and pathos will be dominant modes of\npersuasion. Here, pathos is broadly defined in the Aristotelian tradition as a means of\n\u201ccreating a certain disposition in the audience\u201d (1991: 301) and, while common in forensic\noratory, it is \u201calso at home in deliberative oratory\u201d (Carey, 1996: 405). According to\nAristotelian scholarship, as a means of persuasion ethos is more common in deliberative\noratory, since a credible and trustworthy character of a politician is important in persuading an\naudience, and thus in creating a public opinion.\nThe combination of CDA, rhetorical argumentation analysis and persuasion\ntechniques\u2014or so we assumed\u2014yields a more complete picture of that part of Croatian\npolitical discourse that deals with the question of EU membership.\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Critical Discourse Analysis (lexico-grammatical analysis and figures of speech)\nCritical Discourse Analysis distinguishes among the experiential, the relational and\nthe expressive value of words. For the purpose of this research, the most interesting and\nimportant were the expressive values of words because, as Fairclough (1989: 119) puts it:\n\u201cthey are always the central concern for those interested in persuasive language.\u201d Since\n208 differences between Europhobes and Europhiles are, at least in part, ideological, the\nexpressive value is important insofar as \u201cdifferences between discourse types in the\nexpressive values of words are again ideologically significant\u201d (1989: 119).\nOur analysis supports the claim that the choice of words in the speeches of both\nEurophobes and Europhiles is ideologically motivated in a way that is consistent with the\ndifferences characteristic of right wing and left wing parties. According to the Lexicon of\nBasic Political Terms (Prpi\u0107: 1994) the dominant feature of left-wing parties is liberalism.\nPrpi\u0107 (1994) defines liberalism as a political philosophy which takes freedom to be the main\ncriterion for the evaluation of social institutions. Key terms of liberalism are freedom,\nindividualism, equality, social justice, and democracy. On the other hand, a dominant feature\nof the right is conservatism, for which terms such as legality, sovereignty, and nationalism are\nkey. Since Europhobes are represented by right wing parties and conservative civil\norganizations, the expressive value of words is manifested through terms such as national\nidentity, national consciousness, national treason, independence, national interests etc. The\nmain characteristic of Europhobes\u2019 value of words is aggressiveness, and an anticipation of\n\u201cbad\u201d consequences manifested through strong words like death, tears, grave, slavery,\nhumiliation, danger etc. Europhiles likewise anticipate the future, but expect stability, better\nlife, investments, better education and a higher standard of living.\nThe main difference between Europhobes and Europhiles, as traced through the choice\nof words and the choice of metaphors, is that Europhiles are turning towards the future, while\nEurophobes are expressing their attitudes (implicitly and explicitly) by turning to the past (in\nparticular to Croatia\u2019s history). For Europhiles, a new age is coming, and Croatia is given a\nnew opportunity; for Europhobes, Croatia is about to enter Euroslavia (i.e., is to be enslaved\nby the EU) and is thus looking for a new master. Such differences are at times even more\nexplicit. Europhiles say: vote for the future; Europhobes emphasize: we have to turn to history\n209 to learn how to preserve our national identity. Interestingly, Europhiles use terms such as\nfamily, children and grandchildren more often, which again evidences their orientation to the\nfuture, while Europhobes remember the casualties of the past war, and the generals in prison.\nTable 1 List of expressive words\nEurophobes Europhiles\nBy entering Euroslavia Croatia will lose Signing the most important document in\nindependence (D.

Milanovi\u0107, prime\norganization \u201cBe brave\u201d) minister)\nDifferences between supporters and opponents of the EU are reflected in the figures of speech,\nespecially metaphor. Figurative language in political discourse has been of great interest for\nmany scholars, regardless of the differences in their approaches. For instance, Norrick (2001:\n78) uses a semantic approach, and attempts to demonstrate how an analysis of figures of\nspeech in specific discourse contexts can contribute to our understanding of figurative\nlanguage. Proponents of Conceptual Metaphor Theory such as Grady et al. (1999) hold that\nthe metaphorical meaning occurs in conceptual predication (some A is conceptualized in\nterms of B) when source and target domains are different. Although much of the research on\nhyperbole, tautology and paradox has been undertaken within semantic theory, metaphor has\n212 often been of central interest in CDA. CDA considers metaphor as the most important figure\nof speech because of its connection to ideology. Fairclough (1989: 119) concludes that \u201cany\naspect of experience can be represented in terms of any number of metaphors, and it is the\nrelationship between alternative metaphors that is of particular interest (...) for different\nmetaphors have different ideological attachments.\u201d\nAnalysis of metaphors used in political speeches shows differences between\nEurophobes and Europhiles being reflected in the source of a metaphor. For Europhobes, the\nsource of a metaphor is often the Book of Genesis, Christianity and history in general. The\nEuropean Union is compared with the Tower of Babel which, according to the Book of\nGenesis, had been built by Noah\u2019s descendants (who spoke a single language) \u201cwith its top in\nthe heavens.\u201d This, in turn, angered God and, as a punishment, he confused their languages.\nFurther, supporters of the EU are considered to be non-baptized beasts, human sacrifices on\naltars are made, etc. The conservative point of view is manifested through an unwillingness to\nbe multicultural, to accept differences (we are going to depend on some maharajas), and the\nEuropean Union is seen as a dungeon and a tunnel of darkness. Europhiles are oriented to the\nfuture and to liberal, progressive attitudes which are reflected in metaphors grounded in\ngrowth, progress, and change (Croatia is opening its doors, Croatia is a fertile ground). The\nEU is seen as the light at the end of the tunnel, and the most elite club in the world. For\nEurophobes, Croatian citizens will be slaves (again, returning to the past) and for Europhiles\nthey will be creators of the European destiny (something new, challenging).\nTable 2 Metaphors in speeches of Europhobes and Europhiles\nEurophobes Europhiles\nIf Croatia decides to become a member of The path toward the European Union was\nthe EU in this referendum, then this will covered with thorns (J.

Plenkovi\u0107, state secretary for\nEuropean integration)\n215 Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) has demonstrated that ideological differences between\nEurophobes and Europhiles are manifested in their respective expressions, and that both sides\nuse expressive and ideologically marked terms to persuade, or to sustain a belief already held\nby, their audience. As Fairclough (1989: 152) emphasizes: \u201cJust as even a single sentence has\ntraditionally been seen to imply a whole language, so a single discourse implies a whole\nsociety.\u201d\n3.2. Rhetorical argumentation analysis\nRhetorical analysis introduces the argument component into the speeches of\nEurophobes and Europhiles. Our main goal was to examine the nature of arguments, to\nevaluate them as weak or strong, good or fallacious arguments. Despite some differences in\nthe preferred argument types between opponents and supporters, the similarities are obvious.\nAs was pointed out above, emotional appeals were dominant, especially the appeal to\nfear (loss of sovereignty if Croatia becomes a member of EU or economical collapse if it\ndoesn\u2019t). More traditional logical and epistemological analyses regularly presuppose a strict,\nand ultimately a normative, separation of reason and emotion. Standardly, appeals to fear or\npity are considered means of audience exploitation and manipulation, and are therefore\nconsidered fallacious. However, contemporary scholarship especially in the rhetorical\ntradition of argument analysis suggests a more nuanced understanding, and indeed provides\nsome justification for the use of emotions in argumentation, especially in political discourse\nand the mass media.\nFor Walton (1992: 68) for instance, once one departs from the paradigm equating\ngood arguments with deductively valid forms of inference, one finds numerous legitimate\ncontexts for emotional appeals in argumentation such that appeals to emotion may be more\ngenerally recognized as legitimate arguments under the right conditions. McClurg (1992)\n216 argues that such appeals are not always fallacious, especially not in democratic societies\nwhere political action rightly depends on persuasion, and persuasion in turn depends on\nrhetoric. Based on Walton (2007: 131), the appeal to fear is currently recognized within social\nsciences as a distinct argument scheme, used by those in the business of changing public\nopinion and attitudes through mass media. Although some empirical investigations in the\nsocial sciences have claimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this type or argumentation\nscheme, Trip and Devenport (1988) submit that such arguments are ultimately negative\ninsofar as they sustain inaction, and thus the status quo, while positive arguments work better\nto persuade an audience to take action. Arguments that appeal to fear are typically used in\nissues of health and safety. However, legitimate or not, argumentation cannot be based\ndominantly or solely on appeal to fear. A complete absence of rational reasoning makes the\nargumentation weak and represents a short-cut solution to a complex question.\nTable 3 Appeal to fear in argumentation\nEurophobes Europhiles\nIf Croatia becomes a member of the EU If we miss this chance, the alternative is a\nwithout consulting its people, the Western Balkan. Our standard [of living]\ndemonstrations in Greece and on Wall will decrease. We will suffer. (J. Rado\u0161,\nStreet are going to be a \u201cpiece of cake\u201d HNS)\ncompared to Croatia (I.

Bo\u0161njak, Milanovi\u0107, prime minister)\nrepresentative of civil organization \u201cEU \u2013\nNo, thank you\u201d)\nArguments presented in the speeches of both supporters and opponents to the EU were weak,\nfallacious and regularly overlooked other alternatives (The EU is the only possible solution\naccording to supporters of the EU; otherwise we are going to suffer, be poor, without\npensions and prospect. If we become an EU member, we are going to lose our independence,\nlanguage and identity, according to EU opponets.) It is not implausible that appeals to fear\nmay have caused a negative attitude toward the EU referendum in general; less than 50% of\nCroatian citizens voted in the referendum. Appeals to fear then were a dominant\nargumentation strategy for both Europhobes and Europhiles, which in turn caused the\ndisapproval of many human rights activists. \u017deljko Puhovski, one of the founders and\npresidents of the Croatian Helsinki Committee concluded at the end of the referendum: \u201cThis\n218 is a good result for the EU. It is a shame that it was not reached in democratic way.\u201d(Ve\u010dernji\nlist, January 23 2012)\n3.2.1. Preferred types of argument in the speeches of Europhiles\nArgumentation in the speeches of Europhobes and Europhiles showed some\ndifferences in the choice of arguments. Supporters of the EU (such as the Prime Minister,\ngovernment members and the president) frequently used the argument from expert opinion\nwhich is a species of the argument from authority. Rieke & Sillars (2000: 123) explain that\n\u201ceven persons of high credibility frequently use the credibility of others to argue a claim. In\nargument from authority you argue that a claim is justified because it is held by a credible\nperson.\u201d Willard (1990) claims that public decision-makers are inescapably dependent on\nauthoritative testimony from experts. \u201cThe public decision-maker\u2019s dependence on authority\nis most apparent when we consider that most decisions are inferences drawn from facts or,\nmore accurately, drawn from testimony interpreting facts\u201d (1990: 12).\nAuthorities who were frequently cited, paraphrased or just referred to included:\n1. Paul Vandoren, Head of the Delegation of the European Commission to the Republic\nof Croatia who is referred to when explaining job opportunities in EU in the speeches of the\nminister of foreign affairs Vesna Pusi\u0107.\n2. Stefan Fuele, Commissioner responsible for enlargement and European neighborhood\npolicy who announced the end of the negotiation process; he was referred to in the speech of J.\nKosor when arguing for new economic opportunities Croatia is going to get when becoming a\nmember of European Union.\n219 3. Jose Manuel Barosso, President of the European Commission whose words \u201cthis is a\nvictory moment for all Croatian citizens\u201d after Croatia signed the ascension treaty were cited\nin the speech of president Josipovi\u0107 who promised a higher standard of living.\n4. Berndt Posselt, a German representative in the European Parliament who was\nparaphrased in Jadranka Kosor\u2019s speech as saying that Croatia had the most difficult\nrequirements to become a member and by fulfilling them she becomes the most valuable\nmember of EU.\nStatements of European representatives were used to support the position of the\nEurophiles on how important it is for Croatia to become a member, how successful the\nnegotiation process was (implying that Croatia satisfied many of the EU\u2019s criteria, and\ntherefore improved on its extant laws, judicial system, human rights etc.) and how important\nand welcome Croatia is in the European Union.\nAs Walton (2006: 87) writes: \u201cThe appeal to expert opinion is based on the\nassumption that the source is alleged to be in a position to know about a subject because he or\nshe has expert knowledge of that subject. Appeal to expert opinion should, in most typical\ncases, at any rate, be seen as a plausible but defeasible form of argumentation.\u201d\nSimilarly, Wagemans (2011: 331) writes about the assessment of argumentation from expert\nopinion which is characterized as \u201cargumentation that renders an opinion (more) acceptable\nby claiming that the opinion is asserted by an expert.\u201d\nIn analyzed speeches, the argument from expert opinion is easily defeasible because of\nthe biases of EU representatives. Their knowledge and expertise on EU affairs are not in\nquestion, because the cited authorities are highly positioned representatives with experience in\npolitics. The question, rather, is exactly how biased those authorities are. They are certainly\nnot neutral and objective, since they were involved in the negotiation process, and impartiality\n220 may be viewed as necessary characteristics of authority. From an epistemological perspective,\narguments from expert opinion are a weak part of the Europhile\u2019s argumentation since, as\nWalton emphasized: \u201cUsing the appeal to expert opinion as an argument should not be seen as\na substitute for getting factual evidence by scientific methods of data collection\u201d (2006:\n88).\nEpistemologically stronger arguments by Europhiles were found in speeches citing\nfacts, statistics and examples which they frequently used to point out the benefits of EU\nmembership. Their claims that a better life, a higher living standard and more job\nopportunities would follow from joining the EU were sometimes supported by facts. For\ninstance, the minister of foreign affairs Vesna Pusi\u0107, in an interview for the television show\n\u201cEU 28\u201d (which specifically addressed questions on Croatian EU ascension), explained what\nthe EU means for Croatian citizens:\n\u201c[\u2026] more money in EU development funds than ever before in the Croatian budget and\ndevelopment projects are what makes for new employment and a stronger economy. We will\nget 3.5 billion Euros in the first two years of membership, 373 million Euros for Agriculture.\nEvery Croatian citizen will be free to move and work in all the countries of the EU, students\nwill be able to study abroad. Custom duties and limitations on goods and capital movement\nwill be eliminated.\u201d\nAlthough, the possibility of funding becoming available for Croatia is a good\nargument from consequences, what it lacks is warrant. For instance, the alleged connection\nbetween custom duties and a higher standard of living is not explained in the above example.\nIn the same interview, V. Pusi\u0107 talks about a better judiciary system:\n221 \u201cWhen becoming a member of the EU, the courts are not going to be something that give you\nstomach aches, courts are going to help you, be at your service.\u201d\nFurther on, she claims:\n\u201cThe biggest benefit is stability of the state and institutions. In the EU people will not have to\nfear for their heritage, for their property, for their lives. The EU provides a guarantee for long\nterm stability, and living in a community which is stable is the biggest benefit of all.\u201d\nHer speech is, strictly speaking, an example of circular reasoning; traditionally know\nas petitio principii (i.e., the claim to be supported is presupposed). It this case stability in\nCroatia is supported with stability of the EU (which is a slightly different claim, and could be\nsupported independently).\nAnother characteristic of Europhile argumentation is the frequent use of arguments\nbased on popular opinion (ad populum). Although classical logical analyses regularly\nconsider an argumentum ad populum to be fallacious, Freeman (2005) writes that such\narguments are often assumed to be reasonable, or to have at least some standing, especially in\ndemocratic political system and political argumentation. Herbst (1993) conducted research on\nhow opinion polling shapes politics and states that many arguments in both the political and\nthe private sphere are based on premises that express what public opinion is supposed to be.\nWalton (2006) concludes it is important that arguments are evaluated in each particular case.\nIf so, then the arguments based on popular opinion in the speeches of the Europhiles are in\nmost cases fallacious. For instance, the former Prime Minister J. Kosor\u2019s statement: \u201cIt is\nimportant to learn how to function inside EU and live by the rules which are good for 500\nmillion Europeans,\u201d implies: \u2018if it is good for 500 million people, it will be good for us\u2019\n222 which may be considered to be fallacious. It is plausible that, because of Croatian historical,\npolitical, economical or geographical characteristics, perception or acceptance of some\npolitical rules is going to be debatable.\nThe claim that Croatia achieved a good agreement with the EU during the negotiation\nprocess has also been supported by the number of people who worked on that project. J.\nKosor\u2019s argument that \u201cMore than 3000 people in Croatia worked on the EU project for more\nthan 6 years, closed 35 chapters, met a requirement for more than 400 criteria\u201d is again\nfallacious, in the sense that the number of people and amount of time is not a guarantee of\nquality (though it may defeasibly indicate such quality).\n3.2.2. Preferred types of argument in the speeches of Europhobes\nEurophobes, which were mostly represented by activists and representatives of civil\norganizations, participated in political talk shows and organized protests, arguing that Croatia\nshould say NO on the referendum for EU ascension. The main characteristic of their speeches\nwas the frequent use of argumentum ad hominem which can be considered as the main\ndifference in the argumentation between opponents and supporters of the EU. In contrast,\nEurophiles almost never attacked their opponent\u2019s character.\nCopi and Cohen (1990: 97) explain ad hominem as follows:\n\u201cIt is very common in rough-and-tumble argument to disparage the character of the opponents,\nto deny their intelligence or reasonableness, to question their integrity and so on. But the\npersonal character of an individual is logically irrelevant to the truth or falsehood of what that\nperson says, or the correctness or incorrectness of that person\u2019s argument.\u201d\n223 Contemporary research in argumentation theory, however, recognizes that there is a\n\u201cgood\u201d argumentum ad hominem:\n\u201cA good ad hominem bases a claim on premises that show that someone is in some\nway unreliable. The version of ad hominem we call an \u2018argument against authority\u2019 argues\nthat a person is not a reliable authority and should not, therefore, be taken seriously. (...) It is\nimportant to distinguish ad hominem attacks that discredit a person\u2019s position because of their\ncharacter from attacks on the person alone. The latter is often called an abusive ad hominem\nbecause it does little more than hurl abuse.\u201d (Groarke and Tindale, 2013: 320)\nTherefore, argumentum ad hominem is not always fallacious; it might be considered\nas a legitimate argument which is \u201crelevant to the conclusion of the argument when the person\nin question is supposed to be an expert\u201d (Mizrahi, 2010: 438). However, in our case study the\narguments used by opponents to the EU are instances of the abusive ad hominem, and so\nlogically irrelevant for a critical discussion. They are instances of what Woods calls\n\u201cslanging.\u201d \u201cSlanging is a rhetorical device, as old as the hills. Its objective is to expose,\nembarrass, ridicule, mock, calumniate or humiliate one\u2019s opponent, typically with the intent\nof rattling him dialectically\u201d (Woods, 2007: 109).\nOur analysis of speakers protesting against the EU evidences the usage of a number of\nabusive ad hominem arguments.\nTable 4 Use of abusive ad hominem arguments\nExample of ad hominem argument Speaker\nWho is leading us to Europe?

Discrediting politicians who support the\nEU appears to be the main argumentative strategy. However, they are rarely attacking their\nopponent\u2019s expertise and political competence (this holds especially for the newly elected\ngovernment). As mentioned above, supporting and opposing the EU has ideological grounds\nin the Croatian political discourse. The source of this dispute is the 1990s war between Serbia\n(more precisely, the Yugoslav communist army) and Croatia. Thus, history and a person\u2019s\nethnic origin are the main bases for abusive versions of the argumentum ad hominem.\nApart from an appeal to fear and the abusive argumentum ad hominem, the other most\ncommon form of argumentation used by Europhobes is based on an appeal to pity.\nAggressive presentation and appeal to pity often go hand in hand. Walton (1997: 135) writes:\n226 \u201c[T]he problem is that in many cases appeals to pity are weak and poorly substantiated as\nlogical inferences, yet pressed forward in an aggressive and emotionally powerful\npresentation that is designed to overwhelm the critical judgment of the respondent\u201d.\nAs mentioned earlier, in their speeches Europhobes often refer to the war in Croatia in\nthe 1990s, to Croatian generals who are charged at the The Hague court, and to injustice\nduring their prosecution, to the city of Vukovar and to the thousands of Croatian citizens who\nlost their lives during the war. The Europhobes hold that in this context, the European Union\nis to blame for war (\u201cThe EU was on the Chetnik\u2019s side during the war\u201d \u2013 N. Kova\u010devi\u0107,\nrepresentative of civil organization \u201cJustice\u201d), the EU is responsible for bringing the generals\nto The Hague, where the Croatian government abandoned them and, in the opinion of the\nEurophobes, gave independence to the \u201cgodless creation called EU which wants to turn us\ninto the slaves\u201d (Europhobes protest on the Zagreb\u2019s main square, January 12th 2012 reported\non all Croatian national televisions).\nIn general, Europhobes offered very weak argumentation. Sometimes it was even\nabsurd, including many contradictions, and appeals to emotions. A good example of such\nabsurd claims, weak argumentation and an aggressive presentation is provided by Davor\nPavuna, a Croatian scientist and Europhobe. In the political discussion presented on Croatian\ntelevision, he claimed that Croatia has no chance for prosperity in the EU because it has a\npopulation of only 5 million people (his opponent gave him an example of small countries\nwhich are successful and big countries which are not, concluding that the size of the\npopulation is not significant for the prosperity of a country). Further on, when asked about\nalternatives to the EU, he responded: \u201cThe alternative to the EU is Croatization of the planet\u201d\nwhich, according to him, is possible insofar as Croats currently live in 40 different countries\n227 all over the world. So, on the one hand, there are not enough Croatians to succeed in the EU,\nwhile a \u201cCroatization of the planet\u201d is claimed to be possible. Because of the obvious\ncontradictions and the absurdity of the idea of a \u201cCroatization of the planet,\u201d this speaker was\nnot taken seriously, and his argumentation soon came to be seen as rationally unacceptable.\nA similar answer to the frequently asked question \u201cWhat is the alternative to the EU\u201d\nwas provided by Gordan Masnjak, a representative of the civil organization \u201cNo to EU\u201d who\naddressed a Croatian audience with the answer \u201cthe alternative are all of you!\u201d\nOften represented by speakers with an aggressive presentation, the Europhobes\u2019\nabsurd claims and weak argumentation did not enjoy a strong credibility in the Croatian\npublic sphere. The weakest point of their argumentation, and thus one of the reasons why the\nEurophiles appeal to fear was more effective, consisted in not being able to answer the\nquestion on the alternative to the EU. Answers such as \u201cthe alternative are the Croatian people;\nthe alternative is a Croatization of planet; the alternative is Croatia becoming like Switzerland\u201d\nwere neither persuasive nor convincing. The risk of an economic collapse and a poor credit\nrating (as consequences of remaining outside of the EU) was regarded as the more plausible\nconsequence of non-EU membership than the loss of identity and independence.\n4. Conclusion\nPolitical discourse analysis in Croatia regarding the question of EU ascension included\nCritical Discourse Analysis (CDA) which focused on the usage of expressive and\nideologically marked words and figures of speech, as well as a Rhetorical Analysis which\naimed at discovering the means of persuasion and preferred argumentation strategies in the\nspeeches of the supporters and opponents of EU.\nThe argumentation analysis proceeded descriptively, and aimed at identifying the\nstrength and validity of the arguments in the speeches of Europhobes and Europhiles.\n228 Europhobes claimed that Croatian citizens should vote NO on the referendum, while\nEurophiles claimed that they have to say YES. Argumentation for the claims of both sides\nwas based on appeal to emotions, especially the appeal to fear (rather than more rational\nforms of reasoning). Europhobes stated that becoming a member of the EU meant a loss of\nindependence and sovereignty; this emotional effect appears to have been intensified by\nmentioning the war which Croatia has led to gain its independence after the disintegration of\nYugoslavia. Using the comparison between Yugoslavia and the EU, they predicted another\nwar for Croatia\u2014which plausibly amounted to the strongest appeal to fear available in this\ncontext. Europhiles on the other hand compared Croatia with other Balkan countries, and\npredicted poverty and isolation as consequences of not becoming an EU member. Appeals to\nfear were accompanied by expressive and ideologically marked words such as Euroslavia,\nslavery and humiliation on the one hand, and a historic chance and a new age on the other.\nThe main difference between the argumentation of Europhobes and Europhiles was\nthe use of the abusive argumentum and hominem, often found in the speeches of Europhobes\nbut rarely used by Europhiles. The strategy of attacking an opponent\u2019s credibility, thus his or\nher ethos, was dominant but was deemed fallacious in this study. After all, such attacks were\nnormally not directed at the opponent\u2019s competence, and were normally not corroborated with\nfacts or supported by examples. Rather, such attacks were aimed at offending them on a\nnational basis, by referring to their ethnic or political origin (e.g., coming from a Serbian or\ncommunist family); in other cases these attacks were straightforward assault such as calling\nthem liars, rats, traitors etc.\nEurophiles used the argument from authority to support their claims on job\nopportunities, funding possibilities, the political importance of Croatia etc. Arguments from\nauthority were in this study deemed to be not very strong, considering the subjectivity and\n229 bias of the cited politicians; however, they were frequently corroborated by facts and\nexamples.\nPersuasion through reference to the ethos of the speaker may be expected in political\ndiscourse where a trustworthy character is important. We believe that this had a significant\ninfluence on the result of the referendum (which resulted in a 64% vote pro EU membership).\nRepresentatives of Europhiles included members of the former government, the president\n(who was the most popular Croatian politician) and members of the new government (which\nwon the elections one month before the referendum). Europhobes enjoyed a rather poor\ncredibility because they were not unified, nor organized, but scattered across several small\nparties or organizations, and were often represented by extremists known to the public for\ntheir unpopular, intolerant nationalistic attitudes.\nIn conclusion, this analysis supports the claim that the Croatian political discourse on\nthe issue of EU ascension paid insufficient attention to logos, i.e., rational reasoning, as a way\nof supporting claims and persuading audiences in the public sphere.\nReferences\nAristotle.

In this study an attempt is made to depict the\npersuasive dialogue in the functional language, i.e. the language of politicians in the Polish political arena. Prior\nto that, structuring the content of the article, a theoretical background and methodology are proposed based on\nThe Art of Rhetoric by Aristotle (1959). Three kinds of proofs, means of persuasion or structural principles by\nvirtue of which the goal is attained, i.e. ethos, pathos and logos, are addressed. In the part to follow we will\nanalyse several models of arguments which prevail in the political speeches as well as various means of\nrendering ethos and pathos.\nKey words: language of politicians, inventio, ethos, pathos, logos\n1. Introduction\nClassical rhetoricians defined rhetoric as ars bene dicendi, the art of speaking well, the art\nor skill conveying bene aesthetic beauty and ethical value in dicendi oral and written texts\n234 (Wilczek, 2009: 8). Plato perceived it as the art of leading (\u201calluring\u201d or \u201cbeguiling\u201d \u2013 Asmus,\n1986: 156) the soul by means of words \u2013 seeing in it its deceptive nature, while Gorgias called\nit \u201ca means of fascination, peculiar psychagogia, spiritual seduction with a magical effect\u201d\n(Kucz, 2009: 18), holding \u201cthe power to effect \u2018most divine\u2019 deeds\u201d (Asmus, 1986: 156).\nAristotle (1959: 15) referred to rhetoric as the \u201cthe faculty of discovering the possible means\nof persuasion in reference to any subject whatever\u201d. He argued that rhetoric served \u201cthe\nfunction of no other of the arts, each of which was able to instruct and persuade in its own\nspecial subject\u201d. Rhetoric was not so much to persuade as to find \u201cthe existing means of\npersuasion\u201d (Aristotle, 1959: 13). This belief also \u201cremoves rhetoric from the realm of the\nhaphazard and the fanciful\u201d (Dixon, 1971: 14), the charge which was often filed by the\nAristotle\u2019s opponents.\nAristotle (1959: 3) in his definition of rhetoric compares rhetoric to dialectic, saying it is\nits \u201ccounterpart (\u2026) for both have to do with matters that are in a manner within the\ncognizance of all men and not confined to any special science\u201d. He explicates that \u201call men\n(\u2026) up to a certain point, endeavour to criticise or uphold an argument, to defend themselves\nor to accuse\u201d. However, it needs to be emphasised that some do it accidently, while others do\nso habitually. We can infer that some do not possess any knowledge of the art of rhetoric,\nwhile others grasped the insights and use it to their advantage. The above-mentioned\ndefinition applies to the language of politicians, who sometimes appear to criticise or support\nan argument, or attempt to refute it, or defend it or accuse their opponents of some error in\nreasoning. It cannot, however, escape our attention that in the contemporary language of\npolitics, public relations play a prominent role. Thus the arcane art of how to address the\npublic is becoming or has already become an indispensable and required skill for every\npolitician wishing to achieve success, even if doing so amounts to blurring his/her real\npositions. \u201cRhetoric as a technique of argument (...) rather than of ornamentation\u201d (Dixon,\n235 1971: 14) is to forward its achievement. Even if it constitutes one of the oldest surviving\ndisciplines, its insights and rules still possess the capacity to adjust to the ideological and\nsocial change (Cockcroft and Cockcroft, 2005: 3).\n2. Data presentation\nThe persuasive dialogue in functional language, i.e. the language of politicians, constitutes\nthe central focus of this article. The Art of Rhetoric by Aristotle (1959), in turn, serves as the\ntheoretical background structuring the content of the article. Three kinds of proofs (ethos,\npathos and logos) are discussed, followed by the elaboration of various models of\nargumentation.\nThe ultimate success of the persuasive dialogue is subject to the language chosen to fit in\nwith the subject of the interaction, the social context and the audience. Not only the persuader\nbut also the persuadee needs to be involved, for the dialogic interaction entails reciprocal\nparticipation and involvement. In the material examined we will concentrate on the pragmatic\nand linguistic techniques the persuader uses so as to influence the audience. The material\ncomprises two presidential debates held on 27th and 30th June 2010, between two candidates:\nJaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, representing Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 (Law and Justice), and Bronis\u0142aw\nKomorowski, the candidate of Platforma Obywatelska (Civic Platform). The data for the\nanalysis come from the website of Gazeta Wyborcza: http://wyborcza.pl/. All the extracts\nhave been translated by the author of the article.\n3. Stages of shaping the composition\n236 Cicero (1948: I. 142, quoted in Dixon, 1971: 24) presents a process of rhetorical\ncomposition, in which the orator \u201cmust first hit upon what to say; then manage and marshal\nhis discoveries, not merely in orderly fashion, but with a discriminating eye for the exact\nweight of each argument; next go on to array them in the adornments of style; after that keep\nthem guarded in his memory; and in the end deliver them with effect and charm\u201d. The above-\nmentioned explication can be transferred into skills which consist of \u201cfive phases/stages\u201d\n(Licha\u0144ski, 2007: 87; Wilczek, 2009: 9-10): invention (inventio), arrangement or disposition\n(dispositio), style (elocutio), memory (memoria) and delivery (actio). Our attention, though,\nwill be attached only to the first stage of the classical composition, namely inventio.\n3.1 Inventio\nInvention, being the skill of finding and collecting material, includes: proof, topics, and\ncommonplaces (Dixon, 1971: 24; Licha\u0144ski, 2007: 96). Proof, according to Aristotle (1959:\n15), can be inartificial or artificial, the latter denotes the invention of the speaker, the former\nthe evidence of the law court (Dixon, 1971: 24). In turn, the artificial proof is subdivided into\nethos, pathos and logos.\nThese three kinds of proofs, means of persuasion or structural principles by virtue of\nwhich the goal is attained denote: ethos \u201cthe moral character of the speaker\u201d (persuasion\nthrough personality and stance), pathos \u201cputting the hearer into a certain frame of mind\u201d\n(persuasion through the arousal of emotion), and logos \u201cthe speech itself, in so far as it proves\nor seems to prove\u201d (persuasion through reasoning) (Aristotle, 1959: 17).\n3.1.1 Ethos\n237 Aristotle (1959) in defining ethos as depending upon \u201cmoral character\u201d stresses that it is\nthe \u201cmoral character\u201d of the orator that represents the most influential means of proof when\npersuading the audience. He explains that to persuade by means of perceived \u201cmoral character\u201d\nthe orator needs to deliver a speech in such a manner that the audience will find him/her\nworthy of confidence. Following Robert and Susan Cockcroft (2005) ethos will be divided\ninto personality and stance.\nPersonality is rendered as the power to win trust and confidence in the audience, impress\nthem with individuality. Trust, as Garver (1994: 132-138) and Cockcroft and Cockcroft (2005:\n16) stress, comprises \u201cmoral strength (ar\u00eate), benevolence (eunoia)\u201d, \u201cconstructive\ncompetence or the ability to offer shrewd, practical but principled advice (phronesis)\u201d. As to\nthe individuality, it translates into differentiating such traits of character that would best suit\nthe audience and the topic. What also affects the persuadee is the level of the individual\nengagement of the persuader, the higher the level appears to be, the more compelling the\npersuasion.\nStance equals the persuader\u2019s viewpoint, vantage point, the issue which rests upon the\nsource of the process of interaction, for the success of the exchange cannot be guaranteed in\nits absence. Stance is inherently interactive, and evinces group values, yet, it is entirely\ncontingent upon the persuader.\nThe assessment and confidence of the audience placed in the persuader will be\nsubstantially dependent on the persuader\u2019s stance, along with the personality and image. The\npersuader, on the other hand, must be attentive, observe, adjust to the needs of the audience,\nestablish empathy with the audience. Lynette Hunter (1984, quoted in Cockcroft and\nCockcroft, 2005: 31) asserts that what matters is not the topic someone relies on, but the\nmanner with which they do so. The persuader can assume either a firm, rigid and authoritative\nstance; an indecisive and flexible one; or suppress it before disclosing it later. The stance may\n238 take the form of a structured and ordered process of interaction or a disorganised and\nuncontrollable one. Nevertheless, as Quintilian (1920) upholds, no fixed rules are to be found\nthat can facilitate persuasion. Still, pragmatism, adaptability and flexibility in one\u2019s stance are\nrequisite in order that success is guaranteed. Human capability of choosing the rhetorical\nlanguage facilitating persuasion cannot be excluded as well.\nHunter (1984, quoted in Cockcroft and Cockcroft, 2005: 32) also discriminates between\npositive and negative rhetoric, the former explicates the persuader\u2019s stance as the interaction\nprogresses, depicting shifts in stance; the latter conceals the values and the standpoint. The\npart the audience plays is equally significant. The audience must discern the stance, spot the\nstrategy and evaluate its principles. For, as Hunter (ibid.) maintains, there is nothing worse\nthan naivet\u00e9 of the audience since it results in the audience surrendering to the imposed stance.\n3.1.2 Ethos \u2013 Patterns of behaviour adopted by the persuader\nComing back to the persuader\u2019s stance, we shall propose a few patterns of behaviour s/he\ncan exhibit. To begin with, the persuader can prioritise a stance such that the audience\nperceives the benefits for themselves (positive face, Involvement Strategy (Scollon and\nScollon 1995)), seeks approval, the positive self-image (Brown and Levinson 1987; Kasper\n1994; Scollon and Scollon 1995; Fairclough 1989/2001; Fairclough 1992/2008). The other\npattern relies on the opposite assumption, i.e. the persuader being in the privileged or\nempowered position threatens the audience with the exclusion of the benefits, hence plays on\nthe emotions, pathos, of the audience (negative face \u2013 the want of self-determination, the\nclaim to territories, personal preserves, rights to non-distraction). Tactics described above\nreflect the concept of saving or threatening face rooted in Brown and Levinson\u2019s theory46.\n46 For details on the aspect of face with reference to the language of politicians, see Szczepa\u0144ska-W\u0142och (2010).\n239 As a subsequent tactic worth drawing our attention to, the persuader may adopt lies on the\nbelief that \u201cbeing yourself\u201d does not entail success. Customarily, the persuader needs to\nimplement intuition and calculation in displaying his/her stance, determine how much of self,\nimage and personality to propose so that it will not discourage a prospective listener. Too\npersonal or too impersonal a stance can be equally counter-effective (Hunter 1984).\nLikewise, humour can serve as a tactic deployed by the persuader. It conveys either\na release of tension, acts as a reflection of a non-serious stance, or an embodiment of the\npersuader\u2019s personality, being the consequence of his/her conviction. Lastly, it can also\nfunction as a gun that cons the audience into falsehood, ergo yields dubious benefits.\nChanging sides by the persuader and his/her willingness to admit it openly constitutes\na strategy which, if managed skilfully, can bring a desirable effect. Nonetheless, it appears to\nbe risky and requires a considerable skill. For the inconsistency of stance can exert an adverse\nimpact and lead to the feeling of distrust on the part of the audience (ibid.).\nStance and personality are realised by basic features of language that, as Cockcroft and\nCockcroft (2005: 38) suggest, \u201clay the foundations of meaning and human contact\u201d. The\ndialectic of persuasion is to be grounded in three functions propounded by Halliday (1973), i.e.\nideational (ideas about the real world), interpersonal (social relationships), and textual\n(realisation of language choices). All the functions enumerated must be fulfilled so that the\npersuasive character of ethos is communicated. The first one \u2012 ideational, say, can be realised\nby making use of the language depicting the persuadees\u2019s experience; the second one \u2013\ninterpersonal \u2013 by the use of modal verbs (expressing possibility, uncertainty, criticism,\nexpectation, etc.), and personal pronouns (showing distance); the textual function \u2012 by virtue\nof textual cohesion and coherence: verb tense, syntax, word order and variation of sentence\ntype.\n240 To illustrate the above points and to see how politicians realise ethos, two extracts from\nthe presidential debate held on 27th June 2010 are presented. In the first extract Jaros\u0142aw\nKaczy\u0144ski (a leader of Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107) responds to the question on the equality of\nopportunities between regions in Poland:\n(1) We have two conceptions in Poland. One, in short, is called the conception of\nmotor force and it is the conception of concentrating resources in those regions of\nthe country in which we can already encounter a substantial level of prosperity, in\naddition, it has been estimated that the above-mentioned level of prosperity will\nlater spread over other regions of our homeland. And there is the conception of\nthe balanced development, of which I am a loyal supporter and which I developed\nwhen I was the Prime Minister. It is the conception of a special support for those\nregions of Poland, which suffer \u2013 through no fault of theirs in general, most often\nthrough no fault of theirs \u2013 a certain backwardness. It was articulated by an\nalgorithm of the implementation of the European funds, very beneficial for the\nleast favoured voivodeships [a voivodeship \u2013 a Polish administrative district\nequivalent to a province\u2015ftn. JSW], in particular those in the east, as well as\nspecial programmes, which we managed to win for those voivodeships in Brussels.\nIn short, we are of the opinion that a \u2018good\u2019 development of Poland is equivalent to\na balanced development, and it is essentially in the interest of all of us. For the\nreason that nowhere in the world the development via those so-called motor forces\n\u2013 it has its scholarly name I will not allude to \u2013 brought desirable effects, islands of\nprosperity and the ocean of stagnation were established, or such spheres where the\nreverse process took place, where they were getting poorer. In short, it would be\nbetter if we do not try to implement that conception, I refer to it because the\n241 present government has proposed such sorts of plans under such scholarly terms.\nThose are the plans which are not compatible with what is going on in Poland,\nsince it is not that those metropolises are developing so rapidly in Poland, and,\nI repeat, that conception has not been checked anywhere in the world. Here our\nstandpoint is firm, my standpoint is univocal, as the President of the Republic of\nPoland, I will do everything to make Poland develop in a balanced manner.\nAfter a brief introduction of two concepts of the economic reform of Poland, Jaros\u0142aw\nKaczy\u0144ski openly presents his firm standpoint in saying \u201cI am a loyal supporter\u201d, via the use\nof the first person singular pronoun \u201cI\u201d he emphasises his view. Only twice does he use \u201cI\u201d, in\nthe exordium and peroratio stages of the speech, to open and close his composition, with the\naim of demonstrating his rigid stance (interpersonal function). By contrast, in the course of\nhis speech Kaczy\u0144ski repeats the first person plural pronoun \u201cwe\u201d four times, thus he\nidentifies with his party and reflects their values, or wishes to \u201cget closer\u201d to the audience and\nwarm (improve) his image (Fairclough 1989/2001). Kaczy\u0144ski also repeats the phrase:\n\u201cthrough no fault of theirs in general, most often through no fault of theirs\u201d, to claim common\nground with the audience (ideational function), or rather prospective voters, i.e. the\ninhabitants of the disadvantaged regions, the reason being to win their votes. By referring to\nthe \u201cso-called motor force\u201d and \u201cscholarly term\u201d, he depreciates the government\u2019s policy,\nmoreover, with a derogatory tone. Further, he claims common ground with the people,\ndistances himself from the world of science, often perceived as foreign to the average citizen\nof the country47. Subsequently, he refutes the opponent\u2019s idea by displaying its uselessness.\nHe concludes his speech by confirming his stance.\n47 It needs to be emphasised that politicians appear to juggle that strategy; depending on the aim they strive to\nachieve they either distance themselves from the world of science or show their affiliation with it.\n242 In the second excerpt Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski (a candidate of Platforma Obywatelska\nfor the presidential seat), being interviewed about the problem of legalization of homosexual\nrelationships, declares:\n(2) So, there is a question whether a new law should be established. For in accordance\nwith the Polish law, in effect at present, there is a possibility for inheriting, there is\na possibility for medical care for all the people living in such relationships, which\nare not marriages, except for a few cases concerning, among others, adoption\nrights I cannot imagine that in Poland such a bill can ever be brought forward to\nthe president\u2019s office, since it is something different to create possibilities for\nliving together and taking care of each other, and inheriting, and it is something\ndifferent to go in the direction of mechanisms, or regulations, which concern\na sphere, or a traditional model of family. I suppose that it is rather a fancy\nquestion, because I don\u2019t expect that such a legislative initiative is probable in the\nnearest future, it is rather being talked about in quite narrow circles. One should be\ndecent towards everyone, we should not be too inquisitive about the private lives\nof others, but we can also solve problems of people living in such relationships\ndecently, in accordance with the law currently in effect. If it turned out that\nsomething is missing, that some mechanisms require polishing up, that, for\nexample, there is no easy access to medical care, when somebody goes to hospital,\nso such a bill should be enforced in the name of political decency. But we\nshouldn\u2019t mix it with a problem of marriage, adoption or other situations of that\ntype, which are confined to the marriage of people of different sex.\n243 The question posed by the interviewer appears to be somewhat controversial,\nespecially for a politician representing a right-wing and centre-right-wing party. Nevertheless,\neven if Komorowski evades answering the question, he does not conceal his standpoint. Later,\nwe can decipher that he is in favour of a traditional family model, though, it is expressed\ncovertly (ideational function). He makes use of hedges of casual conversation, such as \u201cI\nsuppose\u201d, modal verbs: \u201ccan\u201d, negative form of \u201ccan\u201d \u2013 \u201ccannot\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, a conditional\nstructure to avoid answering (textual function). He does so in the face of an oncoming election\nand in order not to discourage a part of his electorate. Komorowski\u2019s lexical choice, the use of\ncolloquial or humorous words, e.g. \u201cfancy\u201d (in Polish wydumany denoting something\n\u201cunlikely, improbable, fake\u201d (S\u0142ownik J\u0119zyka Polskiego), or \u201ctrivial, made-up, far-fetched\u201d\n(S\u0142ownik Synonim\u00f3w)) or a not very complex syntax, as well as an impersonal style also serve\nto create his positive image (interpersonal function). The aforementioned factors contribute to\nthe adaptability and flexibility of the candidate, factors which guarantee success in\nthe political discourse, which in turn is persuasive in its nature.\nTo recapitulate, Quintilian maintains that \u201cno man can be a good orator unless he is\na good man\u201d (Non posse oratorem esse nisi virum bonum \u2013 Quintilian, 1907: 416 [12,1,1],\nquoted in Kucz, 2009: 31). Plato (1973: 83), on the other hand, holds that the persuader is an\n\u201cexpert in rhetorical subtlety\u201d, equipped with the knowledge of speech cohesion and\ncoherence (structure of the speech) enabling to offer proof, but without any insight into and\nconsideration of truthfulness or real knowledge of the subject. Which perception appears to be\ncloser to the contemporary definition of the persuader-politician? With the power of PR\nprevailing in the public eye, shaping the ethos of every celebrity in such a manner that by\nmeans of distinctiveness s/he becomes persuasive, losing the real meaning on the way, the\nanswer is: the latter. Today, Aristotelian ethos is substituted for a highly powerful \u201cimage\u201d\n244 exerting a considerable effect on the persuasive language, the success of which is often\nfounded on the image (dress, speech), and political charisma (voice, language, or appearance).\n3.1.3 Pathos\nPathos is equivalent to persuasion through an emotion that is roused (Aristotle, 1959: 17),\nthus the orator by virtue of \u201ca certain frame of mind\u201d entices the audience. The persuader will\nintentionally use an emotional appeal, which many a time constitutes a source of distrust of\nrhetoric, owing to \u201cits association with insincerity, irrationality and rabble-rousing\u201d\n(Cockcroft and Cockcroft, 2005: 55). It seems that there is no other way but to employ\nemotions to manipulate the audience. After all, as Damasio (1999, quoted in Cockcroft and\nCockcroft, 2005: 55) holds \u201chumans cannot think properly unless, as a prior condition, they\nfeel\u201d. Downes (2000, in Cockcroft and Cockcroft, 2005: 55) adds that what we feel mirrors\nwhat we think by means of semiotic systems, i.e. verbal and non-verbal signs. Nonetheless, it\nshould be propounded that emotions can obscure the view, preventing people from gaining a\nbroader and a true perspective on the issues raised, and when out of control can threaten and\ndiscourage the audience.\nCockcroft and Cockcroft (2005: 57) propose two kinds of emotions: universal and\ncontingent. The former reflects emotions common to humanity (e.g. joy, anger, fear), the\nlatter emotions as socially conditioned manifestation (e.g. pride, contempt, indignation, guilt).\nBoth are culture-specific, context-dependent, historically-bound and central to persuasive\nrhetoric. Both are present in literary and functional persuasion, though universal emotion is\noften associated with literary persuasion or formal discourse (Nash, 1989).\nThe use of pathos by the orator will in a substantial manner depend on the agreement\nbetween the persuader, the topic and the audience in a socially structured context.\nNotwithstanding, it is within the ability of the speaker or writer that s/he adjusts the language\n245 to match the topic raised and to appeal to the audience. Therefore it is language that plays\na vital role in the persuasive discourse. It is also via language that the standpoint, the\nprejudices the persuader holds are unveiled. Ergo at this point we return to the\ninterdependence of thought, feeling, and language (and its social context)48.\nFollowing Cicero and Quintilian (1920), vivid and graphic language appears to be\na persuasive factor, enabling the actualisation of emotions. The above-mentioned authors use\nenergeia and fantasia to influence the hearer, energeia renders clarity, fantasia imagination.\nA subsequent factor carrying a highly persuasive aim, somewhat different than the above one,\nis the use of abstract concepts, such as honour, patriotism, or justice. The orator making use\nof the cited concepts may move the audience substantially by alluding to the topics they\nregard highly. Such a strategy resorts to the individual strongly-held beliefs and values, which\nassure the audience of the truthfulness of the persuader and arouse greater confidence in him.\nAgain, we revert to the pragmatic concept of face, in the aforesaid example we can perceive\npositive face realised by claiming common ground, the approval of each other, shared wants\nand shared knowledge, and reciprocity of obligations (Brown and Levinson 1987: 62).\nFinally, it should be borne in mind that playing on pathos can either facilitate the\nunderstanding of a logical argument, helping to acknowledge it, or obscure the logical\njudgement of an argument advanced by the persuader. The persuader wishing to be effective\nin the art of persuasion must acquire all skills indispensable in influencing the audience,\nshould monitor the response, converge with beliefs and convictions of the audience, reverse\nhis own standpoint, if required. It becomes clear that the persuader must acquire\n48 At this point I wish to draw our attention to the significance of language and its social context in the process of\ndiscourse analysis. I advocate a view that language does not exist in isolation. Fairclough (1989/2001,\n1992/2008) in his framework for the textual analysis of discourse or critical discourse analysis explicates that no\nanalysis is reliable without careful examination of three dimensions: textual, discursive and social. Van Dijk\n(1998), in turn, stresses that language users in a communicative act rely on social acts, participate in a form of\ndialogue, which cannot be isolated from social and cultural context. Finally, Bourdieu (2008) highlights that\nlanguage does not exist for its own sake, language is determined by the relation it bears with the speakers who\nbring it into use and who possess language competence, therefore to interact the whole social structure is\nrequired.\n246 psycholinguistic knowledge, i.e. the complexities of the human character, so as to rate the\nresponses of the audience and shape them effectively. All the ploys stated above are realised\nby means of language, which occupies a paramount role. Pathos is actualised with the help of\nargument and repetition, together with stylistic structures, such as antithesis, metaphors and\nrhythmic patterns, syntactic structures, i.e. fronting, word order, interrogatives, and lexis, i.e.\nvivid and descriptive adjectives (Nash, 1989; Cockcroft and Cockcroft, 2005).\nThe following passage is taken from the presidential debate held on 27th June 2010,\nBronis\u0142aw Komorowski responds to the question on the separation of state and church, as well\nas financing in vitro fertilization:\n(3) Ladies and gentleman, not only do I understand a problem of paternity, but also,\nsimply, raised five children. Five times did I experience happiness of being\na parent, a father, and I am the last person who would wish to deprive young\nmarriages or couples of hope, chances, and there are twenty per cent of couples in\nPoland, who cannot have children. (\u2026). But we cannot deprive others of that hope.\nThe issues concerning a system of faith, or an ethical one \u2013 here everyone needs to\ntake decisions in his own conscience whether to employ such method, regarding it\nas effective, or not. Personally, I was, am and will be a supporter of the conciliar\nprinciple in effect between the church and the state, namely mutual respect, respect\nfor the autonomy of the church by the state and the state by the church (\u2026). But\nthe compromise is of high importance, the compromise which was arrived at while\nworking on the anti-abortion law, which allows specific exceptions connected also\nto human life, but it is utterly the law protecting life. I was, am and will always be\nan advocate of life, I have experienced happiness five times, life of my own\n247 children, welcoming lives of my own children, I will not deny anybody the right to\nhappiness.\nBearing in mind the theoretical background on pathos explicated above, we can enumerate\na number of ploys to which Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski resorts, the first being the use of abstract\nconcepts, e.g. happiness, hope, faith, conscience, ethics, religion. By evoking abstract\ncategorization, Komorowski appeals to the emotions of the audience reflecting their values,\naspirations and experience, the concept of positive face is also brought into play. He is aware\nof the fact that by alluding to the concepts the audience prizes greatly, he will win their votes.\nMoreover, he places himself in the position of an expert owing to the experience he has\ngained, making himself worthy of being trusted. Komorowski is sure of his opinion and\nvoices it firmly. Nevertheless, finding some space for a compromise he, conversely, displays\nopenness and flexibility. In the field of the stylistic and syntactic structures we can also spot\nsome examples, i.e. rhythmic patterns, emphatic structures and repetition.\n3.1.4 Logos\nLogos denotes \u201creasoned discourse\u201d, argument from reason. According to Aristotle (1959:\n17), logos relates to \u201cthe speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove\u201d. Persuasion\n\u201cby speech itself\u201d can be achieved only if \u201cthe true\u201d or \u201capparently true\u201d can be extracted\nfrom the ways of persuasion within the particular subject. Paul A. Rahe (2008: 23) adds that\nlogos \u201cmakes it possible (\u2026) to perceive and make clear to others through reasoned discourse\nthe difference between what is advantageous and what is harmful, between what is just and\nwhat is unjust, and between what is good and what is evil\u201d, which undeniably differentiates us\nfrom animals.\n248 Logos is composed of an issue lying at the heart of a debate which needs to be identified,\narguments which will support the issue addressed, the structure of thought which underpins\nthe arguments, coherence and logical value.\nPrior to examining which classes of arguments the speakers or writers employ in the\npersuasive process of the genre under investigation, we shall elaborate on their types.\nAristotle (1959: 265) distinguishes three classes of arguments which need to be applied by the\norators, firstly, the topic of the possible and impossible, secondly, that a thing will happen or\nhas happened, thirdly, the topic of magnitude. The possible explicates that of two contrary\nthings one is possible, so is the other one; analogically, if of two similar things, one is\npossible, so is the other one (an argument a fortiori). The possible, therefore, constitutes the\nsource of arguments for the impossible being the opposite of what has been said about the\npossible. As to a thing that will happen or has happened, Aristotle (1959: 173-273) maintains\nthat if a foundation is laid to believe or if a certain premise has been made that something has\nhappened or will happen, then something will most probably have happened. Finally, topos of\nmagnitude, Aristotle (ibid.) holds that all men use extenuation and amplification\n(exaggeration of both great and small things) in deliberating, praising or blaming, accusing or\ndefending, for \u201cthe particular has more authority than the general\u201d. Not only can the topics of\nargument stimulate the persuader\u2019s mind, but also structure the persuasive discourse, enabling\nthe speaker/writer to make use of all available means, which consequently serve the speaker\nin preparing his/her compositions. Nevertheless, topics, if applied too scrupulously, can\ndeprive a composition of its originality and inventiveness.\nCockcroft and Cockcroft (2005: 83-107), in turn, provide us with ten models of argument,\nas they call them, substituting topoi with models, meaning \u201cadaptable, flexible concepts\u201d,\noffering \u201csystematic and organising methods of \u2018thinking through\u2019 a topic, and of selecting\nand organising the most effective arguments\u201d. The models of argument which will be\n249 discussed are as follows: definition, cause and effect, similarity, oppositional, degree,\ntestimony, genus/species, part/whole, associational, and root meaning.\nThe definition model of argument implies that the speaker or writer makes use of the\ngeneral category so as to move to the unique feature of a point discussed. Thus, in a\npersuasive discourse every definition might incite a counter-definition. The cause and effect\nmodel embodies an integral part of a persuasive process, both in literary and functional\ndiscourse, although it takes a different form in each of them. In the language of politicians,\nwhich is our central focus, it is effect-centred, since the said ploy seems to be more\nconvincing. Nonetheless, it is not devoid of predicaments (e.g. oversimplification,\ndisproportion etc.) Cockcroft and Cockcroft (ibid.) identify three processes of cause and\neffect, the first being a simple cause producing a simple effect, the second a complex cause\nproducing a simple effect, the last one a complex cause producing a complex effect. We need\nto accentuate that the cause and effect model is grounded in the dialectical process.\nComparison and parallelism emerge to be the key issues of the similarity model of argument.\nThe oppositional model, on the other hand, depicts contradictory motifs. We can enumerate\na few sub-varieties of the model: contraries, contradictions, privatives and relatives.\nSimilarly to the cause and effect model, the aforementioned model of argument is present in\na dialectical process, involving two-way interaction, not infrequent in the language of\npoliticians, in which one thread of thinking is adopted ruling out at the same time the other\none. Such an argument lies at the basis of provocation. The degree model of argument\nconstitutes the third common topos referred to in political rhetoric by Aristotle, together with\nthe similarity and oppositional models. It rests upon constant dynamics, desirability of a goal,\ninstrumental means of achieving it (ibid.). The subsequent type, i.e. the testimony model, is\nfounded on the credibility of a witness, as a consequence it is considered as one of the\nweakest topics. The testimony model is to be encountered in television broadcasts, notably\n250 political interviews, for its declarative function, in which the political figures display their\nloyalty and support for a particular standpoint or a political party or offers certain instruction,\nhence it often acts as an ideological weapon. The genus/species type of argument carries an\ninteractional function, in which the speakers after initiating a discussion, making a statement,\nrefute each other\u2019s arguments, moving from genus to species, or further to sub-species. The\npart/whole model appears to correspond to the previous model of argument. What\ndifferentiates it from the former is that the genus/species can exist separately, while parts and\nwholes are co-dependent. In the associational model the hearer is manipulated by false logical\nand ethical assumptions. The above argument can be sub-divided into subject/adjunct (a\nquality, condition of a subject being its basis), lifestyle/status (an argument, the basis of which\nbeing lifestyle/status), place/function (place/function taking the role of a premise), or\ntime/activity (an argument reflecting people\u2019s expectations and social rituals) association\nmodels of argument (ibid.). Lastly, the root meaning category of argument typifies one of the\nmost manipulative models of argument, the persuader changes the received meaning of\na word used and searches for the hidden or alternative meaning.\n3.1.5 Models of argument versus language of politicians\nAfter having examined two presidential debates held on 27th and 30th June 2010, we can\ncome to a number of conclusions. Firstly, there are several models of argument which prevail\nin the political speeches \u2013 namely, cause and effect, degree, genus and species, associational\nand oppositional (of dialectical nature); the rationale being its persuasive and emotive\nfunctions, as well as vivid distinctiveness in the values and standpoint the politicians have\nadopted. Secondly, the remaining models are either too sophisticated and would require\ngreater expertise or are not beneficial enough to be used in the political discourse. Lastly, the\n251 choice of arguments is highly dependent on loyalty and ideology of a politician, the party s/he\nadheres to determines a line of attack he pursues.\nLet us now provide a few examples of the above-mentioned models:\n1/ definition model of argument, in which a generalisation is narrowed down into a precise\nmeaning:\n(4) Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski: (\u2026) privatization, as I have already said, conveys an\nintroduction of entirely different rules of the game. A private hospital will have a possibility to\nsign an agreement with the National Fund, though it will not be required, and there is\nevery likelihood that such a situation will take place that people belonging to a low\nincome group will simply not have an easy access to treatment, at least in their\ntowns/cities.\n2/ cause and effect model of argument, Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski by means of a conditional\nsentence explicates that the effect of a fall of a standard of living will be emigration to Great\nBritain \u2013 a simple effect produced by a simple cause; in the second example granted that\nliberal ideology is challenged, Poland will become a more prosperous country \u2013 seemingly49 a\nsimple effect of a simple cause:\n(5) Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski: If the standard of living is improved, nobody will go to\nGreat Britain.\n(6) Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski: (\u2026) only when we reject liberal ideology (\u2026) only then will\nwe bring about development of Poland.\n49 I deliberately use the word \u201cseemingly\u201d for the argument is simple only in wording.\n252 3/ similarity model of argument \u2013 the following example rests upon parallelism of the process,\nthe speaker\u2019s understanding of a problem is linked to his memory-based schemata, that is the\nspeaker\u2019s experience:\n(7) Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski: Ladies and gentleman, not only do I understand\na problem of paternity, but I also, simply, raised five children.\n4/ oppositional model of argument \u2013 the example below is grounded in a dialectical process,\ninvolving two-way interaction between two participants. Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski responds to the\nquestion on equal opportunities between Poland A and B. He firmly states that such a division\nis present in Poland; at the same time he provides solutions to the problem. In turn, Bronis\u0142aw\nKomorowski denies that the division exists (the argument Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski employed\nmight have been borrowed from Barak Obama\u2019s 2004 Democratic Convention Keynote\nspeech in which he said that \u201cThere are no red states. There are no blue states. There is only\nthe United States of America\u201d, the speech that earned Barak Obama widespread and well-\ndeserved recognition with respect to successful rhetoric):\n(8) Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski: There is one Poland, there is neither Poland A nor B, nor\nC nor D. There is no north, south, west or east Poland. There is one Poland and we\nneed to take care of it, and the government does it.\n5/ degree model of argument \u2013 both examples are founded on the qualitative aspect of\nargument saying that one thing is better/cheaper, etc. than another one:\n(9) Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski: It is important for the professional army, such is always\nbetter (\u2026)\n(10) Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski: For sure Poland is much stronger than in 1997 (\u2026)\n253 6/ testimony model of argument \u2013 considered one of the weakest of topoi, however, in the\npolitical discourse it may be used as an ideological weapon. In the example to follow, the\ninterviewee instructs the audience how to act, he also accentuates his stance by the use of\nanaphora:\n(11) Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski: It is an old teaching of Giedroy\u0107, it is an old teaching of\nJ\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, we should make use of it and we should all go this way.\n7/ genus/species model of argument \u2013 the following dialectical model of argument is based on\nthe pattern: genus to species, species to sub-species, etc. By way of illustration, Bronis\u0142aw\nKomorowski makes an assumption, in turn Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski counters this assumption with\na subsequent example, the procedure further continues. In the example to follow we can also\nspot aitiologia (a rhetorical figure (trope), in which the same speaker asks and later answers a\nquestion posed), a ploy popular in political rhetoric:\n(12) Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski: Facts are on our side: is there half a billion for the\nUniversity of Rzesz\u00f3w? Yes, there is. Is there an improvement of an algorithm\ncalculating money for health sector? Yes, there is. You took it away, we will give\nit and that\u2019s the difference. There is no point in alluding to theories, of one kind or\nanother, facts are unrelenting (undeniable) Mr Chairman, and that\u2019s all, full stop.\nJaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski: I also have some time, so I will say: half a billion is much\nless than, for example, twelve billion for G\u0119sicka\u2019s plans. Well, Mr Speaker, you\nwon\u2019t escape from it.\nBronis\u0142aw Komorowski: Well, Mr Chairman, you can promise twelve billion, but\nyou didn\u2019t give a penny, but we will give half a billion.\nJaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski: It came from the European funds.\n254 8/ part/whole model of argument \u2013 in which the part represents the whole, in the example\nbelow, the speaker enumerates consequences of an economic crisis pertaining to supply\nestimates and public expenditure, which represent parts of a larger whole:\n(13) Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski: The Italians cut clerks\u2019 salaries, pensions (\u2026)\n9/ associational model of argument \u2013 it provokes the user to make false logical assumptions,\nas may be the case of the example to follow:\n(14) Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski: (\u2026) contrary to what the Minister of Foreign Affairs of\nthat government claims, so I presume so does Mr Speaker (\u2026)\n10/ root meaning model of argument \u2013 characteristic of manipulation, the interviewee\ndeliberately searches for an alternative meaning of a word to manipulate. In the context\nmentioned the speaker uses the word: \u201creport\u201d sarcastically, for it was uttered by the brother\nof his opponent after he won the election in 2005, in the form: I report that the task has been\ncompleted (originally the statement was not used to display complete dependence, which this\nword may denote, but to express contentment resulting from victory). Bronis\u0142aw\nKomorowski, however, attempts to distort the meaning by referring to it literally since he\nwishes to show that he is an independent politician:\n(15) Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski: (\u2026) I will not file a report to the Prime Minister (\u2026)\n4. Conclusion\nIn every discourse where persuasion is the primary goal we observe the co-existence of\nthe structural principles: ethos, pathos and logos. The type of interaction, personality, stance,\nas well as emotional appeal may determine the choice of arguments. Conversely, the choice of\narguments may reflect the influence arguments exert on emotions and standpoint adopted by\n255 the persuader. The process is simultaneous. Quintilian (quoted in Dixon, 1971: 25)\nmaintained that every aspect of speech enhances character: the tone reveals the orator\u2019s good\nwill towards the audience, the ordering of arguments reflects his/her intelligence and sense of\nvalues, while the feelings expressed embody the goodness of his/her heart. Ergo the orator\nshould be able to comprehend psychology, know the values of the audience and respond to\nthem effectively and truthfully.\nTactics employed by the speaker include postulating the irrelevance of the opponent\u2019s\nargument, by showing its ambiguity, inconsistency or preposterousness. In effective\npersuasion the issue, the arguments and their relevance must stand in line since an attentive\nhearer will perceive any incoherence and lack of cohesion upon which they are grounded.\nCorrespondingly, the more the persuader understands his audience, the more s/he will be\ncompelling.\nAccording to classical rhetoric, all the arguments are or can be polar opposites,\n\u201ceither/or\u201d, hence they can limit a free mind. The composition, structurally controlled,\nsystematised and classified, may cramp a free development of ideas. Aristotelian rhetoric\noffers a form of argument, not a compromise, agony being its aim (Dixon, 197; Budzy\u0144ska-\nDaca, 2008). The language of politics appears to draw interest from that rhetoric, in which it\nhas inexorably settled, for the aim of the political discourse is tantamount to that of rhetoric,\neven if it has, in the opinion of its opponents, become morally suspect, \u201cthe art of the purple\npassage and the debating trick, language masquerading as thought\u201d (Dixon, 1971: 1-2, 70),\nlanguage used so as to \u201cinfluence, persuade, perhaps to exhort and instruct\u201d, language used to\nmanipulate, language requiring consummate skills.\nIn sum, on one hand, we can defend a position adopted by Cap (2005, 2006, quoted in\nSkowro\u0144ska, 2010), who upholds that \u201cskilful use of language is not only an asset, but a must\nin legitimization\u201d of politics, \u201cbroadly defined as the ultimate goal sought by politicians\u201d. On\n256 the other one, following Chilton (2004: 23), we can accept the assumption that every political\nspeaker needs to \u201cimbue their utterances with evidence, authority and truth\u201d. According to\nAristotle, word has to be bound with being, as a remedy for abuse and manipulation within\nhuman cognition (Stefa\u0144czyk, 2000, quoted in Kucz, 2009: 22). The question arises: does\nanybody attach any importance to actions in the era of power of mass media? Do actions\nspeak louder than words? Highly debatable. A word is the weapon in Plato\u2019s rhetoric,\nsomething you use to fight with the opponent\u2019s view, or rather with him/her in person,\nsomething you apply to defend, refute or maintain the stance adopted, something fulfilling\na conative function, finally, something lying on the brink of manipulation. Ergo does rhetoric\nrender martial art or the art of winning the soul by discourse? Both, depending on the\nperspective we adopt or, more probable, on the goal a politician wishes to achieve.\nReferences:\nAndrews, R.

The corpus for analysis\nincludes transcripts of two sessions of the 6th Parliamentary assembly and 5 randomly selected sessions from\neach of the previous assemblies. The corpus includes Aktualno prijepodne (i.e. Question time) as well. Levels of\nanalysis are: forms of (un)parliamentary polarization, mitigation strategies and identification of convergence\n(between a group of like-minded politicians) and divergence (between opposing groups) by usage of insults and\nderogatory terms. Reactions to the insults were analyzed as part of the identification process, as it was noted that\nthe Members of Parliament (MPs) were often offended by the insult and wanted to comment on it, even when the\ninsult was not personally addressed to them.\nThe results show, as expected, that the MPs of the Croatian Parliament are polarized. The offensive expressions\nare based on pathos in first Assemblies, while later change to ethos-oriented logos, mainly trying to discredit the\nMPs' credibility, with occurrences of ad hominem arguments. The preferred mitigation strategies are attribution\ntransfer, followed by formulation of insults as questions rather than statements. Unification of politicians is\npurely along the party-line and is shown through forms of address, the procedures to respond to offensive\nphrases, labeling and stereotypes.\nKey words: insults, insulting practices, Croatian parliament, mitigating strategies, logos,\npathos and ethos\n262 1. Introduction\nThis paper provides an insight into the insulting practices found in the Croatian\nParliament compared with the recorded instances of British and Swedish parliaments (Illie,\n2001, 2004, 2010a, 2010b). It also offers some explanation to the underlying workings of the\ninsult initiator and insult target.\nIn everyday life individuals sometimes tend to express their opinions of politicians in the\nform of insults. When speaking privately, people can say more or less whatever they want\nwithout any consequences, but what happens when one is using offensive, derogatory or\ndisparaging terms publicly? More oppressive societies have insult laws (Walden, 2002: 207)\nwhich \u201cregulate freedom of expression and enforce laws that punish the criticism of the\ngovernment officials and institutions\u201c. In their basis, these laws are very rigid, oppressive and\nprevent freedom of speech and opinion. On the other side, democratic societies take pride in\nthe possibility of an individual publicly saying whatever s/he chooses. Nonetheless, even such\nsocieties have something to regulate offensive public discourse, and that is criminal\ndefamation law (Walden, 2002) which protects a person when his/her reputation is threatened\nby falsely asserting a fact. Therefore, when speaking publicly, especially when one\u2019s\nconversation is being broadcast or documented, individuals need to think in advance of how\nand to whom they are going to address their insult, as there are consequences to their speech\nacts. However, what happens when an insult is done in the parliament by the Member of\nParliament (MP)? Do the same rules apply? Is it normal to expect and assume that, beside the\nproscribed rules of conduct in the Parliament, working in such an environment and at such a\ndistinguished position will immediately bring a higher moral code and values of conduct of its\nelected officials?\n263 1.2. Rationale\nStudying insults, especially those done by the MPs can give an insight into \u201csocial and\ncultural systems of moral values'' (Ilie, 2004: 45), ideology behind the insult, party affiliation,\nbalance of power between the opposing sides/parties, power (not only power granted by\n\u201cinstitutional status\u201c (Ilie, 2001: 236), but power seen as \u201c \u2018interactional skill and\nprocess\u2019\u201c (2001 :236), i.e. the power obtained through interaction with other MPs, and finally,\nlanguage style of an individual MP. Diachronic analysis of unparliamentary discursive\npractices during different parliament sessions can reveal the possible change of\ninstitutionalized language as well as indicate the degree of development of a national\nparliamentary discourse and, implicitly, of democracy itself. Cross-cultural studies (Ilie, 2001,\n2004, 2010a, 2010b), like this one, show forms and functions of insults in different cultures,\nthe direction of parliamentary discourse in connection with the political/social climate, and\ncan serve as a possible guideline of conduct for the future elected government officials.\n1.3. Research questions\nHow do MPs gain desired discursive power and, implicitly, more influence with the wider\naudience? Do insults play an important role in attention-getting? What is perceived as an\ninsult by MPs and what triggers a response? Do the MPs respond to the insults? Are insults\nparty \u2013line, wing-line or individually oriented? How do insulting practices change over time,\nif they do? Which types of parliamentary insulting strategies are preferred and dispreferred in\nCroatian debates in comparison to British and Swedish ones? Does the change in insulting\npractice show development of parliamentary discourse, its participants and, implicitly, of\ndemocracy itself? These were some of the questions that this research has raised.\n264 1.4. Historical overview\nThe Croatian Parliament (Hrvatski Sabor), 22 years since its foundation, is significantly\nyounger when compared with the other parliaments in similar studies. The modern British\nParliament, one of the oldest continuous representative assemblies in the world, was formed\nin 1707 but has its traditions set way back into the 13th century50 and the Swedish one\n(Riksdag), established in 1917, has roots found in 145351. The modern Croatian Parliament\nwas formed in 1990 and although its origins can be traced back into the 13th century, geo-\npolitical changes in Croatia from that period onwards make this historical continuity\nirrelevant for this research. Although the representative body can be treated as a fairly new\nphenomenon in Croatia, the same cannot be said for the profession of politician. Specifically,\na number of representatives in the Croatian Parliament had significant political functions in\nthe political institutions of Yugoslavia and consequently more experience in public speaking\nthan other MPs in the newly formed Croatian Parliament in the nineties. However,\ncommunism and democracy do not share the same political discourse practice. Therefore,\npossible in/experience of politicians in political discourse and its correlation with success of\ngetting across ideas/views will be left for some future studies.\nAfter the Croatian War of Independence and the formation of the modern Croatian\nParliament in 1990, the predominant numbers of seats were mostly won by the moderate\nright-wing party HDZ (Croatian Democratic Union). According to \u010cular (2001) the Croatian\nparty system consists of 7 larger parties: HDZ (Croatian Democratic Union), SDP (Social\nDemocratic Party), HNS (Croatian Peoples Party), HSLS (Croatian Social Liberal Party),\nHSS (Croatian Peasant Party), IDS (Istrian Democratic Assembly) and HSP (Croatian Party\n50 http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/originsofparliament/\n51 http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/4140\n265 of the Right). Although the number of parties has changed over time, the two most influential\nparties from that time onwards are the already mentioned HDZ and SDP (Social Democratic\nParty), which is a moderate left-wing party. Although both parties place themselves around\nthe centre, Croatian people perceive them as more predominantly left and right (Bankovi\u0107 \u2013\nMandi\u0107, 2007).\n2. Theoretical background\n2.1. Insults and culture\nDifferent cultures use abusive language in a variety of ways and in different areas of life.\nBrown and Levinson (1987) claimed that politeness is a universal concept, but also that some\ncultures may be characterized as negative politeness cultures and others as positive politeness\ncultures. Although Spencer-Oatey (2002 qtd. in Hickey and Stewart 2005) disputes this\napproach saying it is susceptible to ethnocentrism, everyone who is familiar with the situation\nin Croatia can confirm that Croatian society is quite ethnocentric, especially because of the\nCroatian War of Independence that made Croatians quite sensitive to their own national\nidentity. Even though tradition makes up an important part of Croatian everyday life, polite\nforms of address have changed as they have been much more rigid in the past than they are\nnowadays (Marot, 2005). This could be the result of a merger between previously strictly\nseparated forms of written and spoken politeness, or \u201cmultifunctionality\u201c52 (Sili\u0107, 2006:36) of\nlanguage in different contexts of public communication, which is shaped by different\nfunctional styles (Sili\u0107, 2006). The same dichotomy has been noted in Italian political\nlanguage (Galli de\u2019 Paratesi, 2009; Held, 2005). As in Italy, written politeness in Croatia is\nstill much more formal and rigid than the more spoken-oriented style, characterized by more\n52 Originally in Croatian, translated by Van\u010dura\n266 simplified syntactic patterns, less complex vocabulary and direct language, all \u201cwith the aim\nof realizing spontaneity\u201c (Galli de\u2019 Paratesi, 2009: 138). As a result, the public \u201chas learned\nnot to be surprised any more at expressions that were once confined to dialect and lower\nregisters, typical of extremely familiar and highly informal situations\u201c53 (Galli de\u2019 Paratesi,\n2009: 140). With this gradual erosion of respect for institutional conduct, it is only natural to\nexpect the common usage of verbal transgressions in the Croatian Parliament, as they\nrepresent one of the basic expressions of a linguistic substandard.\n2.2.Insults as unparliamentary language\nThe unparliamentary language was defined and described extensively in the work of Ilie\n(2001, 2004), who says that those are \u201csubversive transgressions of the institutional\nboundaries of parliamentary language use and practices\u201c (2001: 259). One is immediately\naware that the context of argumentation (Tindale, 2007), beside being multi-layered, varied\nand complex, is extremely important for the analysis of these transgressions. Richards (1938\nqtd. in Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca 2008:124) stresses that \u201cit is always the context that\ngives a word its meaning, and it is only through the context that we can discover what the\nword does\u201c. Irvine (1993: 110) specifies that \u201cinsult is a communicative effect constructed in\ninteraction\u201c, which presupposes a context of some kind. On the other hand, whether or not\nsomething is going to be perceived as an insult and bring about any kind of response relies\nheavily on the affective characteristics of the insult target. This is what J. L. Austin (1975)\ncalls illocutionary force of an utterance, where in order to properly understand the message\nthe listener needs to understand the intention of the speaker and what he meant, how the\nwords spoken were used, or how the utterance was to be taken or ought to have been taken.\n53 Originally in Italian, translated by Van\u010dura\n267 As Ilie (2001: 237-238) says \u201cwords are not insulting in themselves, but rather that it is their\nunderlying conceptualisations which are perceived as offensive\u201c. These underlying\nconceptualizations mostly derive from a linguistic base, but we believe that insult\ncategorization also strongly relies on an extralinguistic base, i.e. paralinguistic cues. Thus, it\nis both the emotional characteristic of the insult target/s, as well as the emotionality of the\ninsult initiator that are indispensable for understanding an utterance. \u201cThe more emotional an\nutterance is, the more significant the role of the intonation, while at the same time the\nimportance of lexical (linguistic) material diminishes\u201c54 (Vuleti\u0107, 1980: 35). Finally, we can\nconclude that insults are defined through both linguistic and paralinguistic cues.\nWhen used in Parliament, insults represent deviations from the norm in a highly normative\ncontext where MPs\u2019 conduct is controlled by the speaker and the proscribed rules, i.e.\nStanding Orders of the Croatian Parliament, Code of Conduct, and Code of Ethics for Civil\nServants55. Parliament sessions provide a highly competitive context and political discourse\n\u201cinvolves cooperation as well as conflict\u201c (Chilton, 2004: 198). These parlamentary\ndivergences quite often turn into debates which can be defined as \u201cinstitutionalised\ndeliberation ritual that starts with a basic assumption on the part of the debators concerning\nthe desirability of deliberating and taking action in order to bring about certain agreed upon\nchanges in society\u201c (Ilie, 2001:242). Debates that are held in the parliament are commonly\nknown to be adversarial, and MPs try to show their power by attacking and counter-attacking\neach other, so it is of no surprise that they will use unparliamentary language. Face \u2013\nthreatening acts include requesting, advising, refusing or criticizing and reflect \u201csocial-power\nstructures\u201c (Held, 2005: 294) and quite often evolve into insults or are perceived as insults.\nInsults serve to undermine MPs\u2019 credibility or a party\u2019s institutional trustworthiness and\nconsequentially, serve to enhance the ethos of the insult initiator and shatter the opposing\n54 Originally in Croatian, translated by Van\u010dura\n55 http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=714\n268 party's reliability. Ethos is seen in the Aristotelian tradition (Habinek, 2005), where proofs, in\nthis case insults, are based on some feature of the insult target character.\n3. Methodology\n3.1.Corpus\nThe examined corpus consists of transcripts of two sessions of the 6th Parliamentary\nterm and 5 randomly selected sessions from each of the previous Parliamentary terms as well\nas Question time (Aktualno prijepodne), randomly chosen from the 1992-2011 period. The\nsessions were: fourth session in the Second Term (November 1992), 22nd session from the\nThird Term (November 1997), 36th session from the Fourth Term (September, 2003), 17th\nSession form the Fifth Term (November, 2005), 23rd and 24th session from the Sixth Term\n(April, October 2011). One session, i.e. debates about different proceedings, lasts on average\n12-14 hours, so altogether about 70 hours of material have been analyzed.\n3.2. Criteria\nThe criteria that was used for insult selection was either content-based or response-type\nbased because, as previously discussed, context and illocutionary force of an utterance play an\nimportant role in defining what can be perceived as an insult. If the insult was response-based,\nit was observed whether it was by an addressee, party-member or the speaker or whether\nparalinguistic cues were used. No response to an insult was signaled by the MP going back to\nthe content.\n269 3.3. Procedure\nThe corpus was analyzed in the following way. First, the recorded sessions were watched\nand then the part of MPs\u2019 speech or debate evaluated as an insult was transcribed. The\nanalysis of data was based on Ilie's (2004) framework of interface between rhetoric, discourse\nanalysis and cognitive linguistics. Firstly, a discourse theory perspective with foundations in\nLakoff and Johnson\u2019s (1980 qtd. in Ilie 2004) cognitive schemata theory was applied. It\nexplains that the human process of understanding is done through image-schematic structures\nwhich are \u201crooted in preconceptual embodiment patterns\u201c (2004: 49) and which thus reveal\n\u201cinferential processes and implied meanings that are derived in the course of institutional\nconfrontation\u201c (2004: 49). Secondly, parliamentary transgressions were analyzed based on the\nclassical Aristotelian rhetorical framework (Habinek, 2005) where the insults, insult initiator/s\nand insult target/s are observed through types of categories the orator uses in his discourse (in\nour case insulting strategy) for his insult to come through. Logos oriented insults focus on the\nrational use of language and the reasoning stems from the language itself. Ethos oriented\ninsults appeal to the insult initiator or insult target character or moral qualities, and pathos\noriented are those that are based on emotion, feelings of the audience \u201cthat can change the\nways that people affect their judgments\u201c(Jaffe, 2010: 338).\nLevels of analysis included, on the one hand direct insulting strategies mostly done\nthrough fallacies like ad hominem, antiphrasis, guilt by association types of arguments and\nwhich serve to establish either in-group identity or polarization. On the other hand, indirect\ninsulting strategies were analyzed, which were achieved through rhetorical (rhetorical\nquestions, sarcasm, irony) or pragmatic (juxtaposition of opposite notions, insults formed as\nquestions, attribution transfer strategy) devices. All the aforementioned levels of analysis\nwere then placed according to Ilie\u2019s (2004) division into layers of (un)parliamentary\npolarization 4.1., (un)parliamentary mitigation strategies 4.2., and interplay between in-group\n270 identity and inter-group dissent 4.3., expanded by diachronic aspect of parliamentary\ndiscourse.\nFurthermore, we have compared insults in the Croatian Parliament with the recorded\ninstances of British and Swedish Parliaments (Ilie, 2004, 2009, 2010a) to see whether they\nvary in forms and functions and to identify culture-specific correlations between them.\nFinally, to get a deeper insight of the possible temporal change of parliamentary discourse\nin Croatia, we have observed different sessions through a period of time in order to get a\ndiachronic perspective that would show the possible development in the deliberative genre\n(Habinek 2005, Ilie, 2004).\n4. Results and Discussion\nResults show that Croatian MPs use different insulting strategies to establish the\ntrustworthiness of their party and their own credibility i.e. their \u201c(rhetorical ethos), primarily\nby displaying consistency between their statements and their actions\u201c (Ilie, 2009:72) as\nopposed to other MPs, representing other parties.\nIn spite of political and organizational differences between Swedish, British and Croatian\nParliaments, we can say that they display some common features, such as tendency of MPs to\nexchange rude remarks in heated debates which are then kept under control by the Speaker.\nThe possibility of comparison lies in the fact that \u201crudeness seems to be a universally\noccurring phenomenon\u201c(Ilie, 2004: 51) and that basic rhetoric patterns and insulting strategies\nare shared by the MPs of the previously mentioned institutions.\n4.1. Direct insulting strategies: (un)parliamentary polarization\nCroatian MPs show similar strategies in debates to British MPs in the sense that they both\nshow a \u201cconfrontation-seeking tendency\u201c (Ilie, 2004: 54) and are not that keen on trying to\n271 minimize disagreement as is the case with the Swedish MPs. The political polarization is\nbased on party membership, which can be supported by the fact that no instance of an MP\ninsulting another MP that belongs to his/her party has been documented. However,\npolarization in terms of political orientation is quite common and depends solely on the\ncoalition formed during a particular term. Direct insults, even in the forms of address are quite\nfrequent and the etiquette sometimes presents a good opportunity for a direct insult, as the\nfollowing examples will show56:\n(1) B, A.

Sanader: Mrs. Jadranka Kosor. And the\nquestion is: do you know how many workers in Croatia do not receive a salary?\n(Term 6/ session 23, Question time, 6 April, 2011)\nThis example precisely shows how insults are context-based, as it seems like there is no harm\nin an MP enumerating all of the ex-Prime Minister's (PM) titles. The context in which these\nforms of address were perceived and interpreted as insulting was instigated by the Prime\nMinister\u2019s reaction during the Question time in which she often warned other MPs who spoke\n56 The examples show MPs' initials followed by his/her political party. We believe that party allegiances are\nimportant for better understanding of the examples. Italicized is the part of the example that best represents the\ncategory under discussion.\n272 before A. B. to use the proper forms to address her, for instance when they forgot to say Prime\nMinister before her name. This example shows how irony and playful tone can disguise the\nMP's hostile and scornful attitude, but also how paralinguistic cues can be essential for insult\nrecognition, since the whole form of address is purely ironic. It also displays guilt by\nassociation type of ad hominem (Tindale, 2007), with the attempt to discredit the PM by\nclosely associating her in the penultimate and the last form of address to the ex-prime minister,\nwho was at the time awaiting trial for a corruption scandal. The insult assumes that any \u2018guilt\u2019\nthat characterizes the former PM can be transferred to the insult target (PM at the time) as\nwell.\n(2) J, \u017d. (SDP): Moje pitanje je namijenjeno osobno odabranoj nasljednici Ive\nSanadera na mjesto predsjednice Vlade, gospo\u0111i Kosor. Gospo\u0111o Kosor mo\u017eete li\nnam re\u0107i kako se u Hrvatskoj mo\u017ee pre\u017eivjeti sa 2 tisu\u0107e kuna pla\u0107e ili mirovine?\n(6/23, Aktualno prijepodne, 6.travanj 2011)\n(3) K, J. (Premijerka): Gospodine predsjedni\u010de, budu\u0107i da ovo nije pitanje nego samo\nnastojanje da se uvrijedi, ja, naravno, to je poznato javnosti koja poznaje Ustav\nRepublike Hrvatske i hrvatske zakone da ja nisam nasljednica jer ovo nije\nmonarhija, pa onda ja ne mogu biti nasljednica. (...) Ja \u0107u vam na ovo pitanje koje\nto nije odgovoriti, objasnite vi meni gospodine Jovanovi\u0107u kako se mo\u017ee ljetovati\nza 7 kuna i je li se pri tom platio ili se nije pri tom platio PDV? (6/23, Aktualno\nprijepodne 6.travnja 2011.)\n\u017d. J. (SocDem): My question is for the personally selected successor of Ivo\nSanader in the place of Prime Minister, Mrs. Kosor. Mrs. Kosor can you tell us:\n273 how can you survive with a two thousand kuna salary or pension in Croatia? (6/23,\nQuestion time, 6 April, 2011)\nJ.K. (Prime Minister): Mr. Speaker, since this is not a question as it is an attempt\nto insult, I, of course, it is known to the public who knows the Constitution of the\nRepublic of Croatia and Croatian laws, that I am not the successor, because this is\nnot a monarchy, and then I cannot be the successor. (...) I will give an answer to\nthis question, although it is actually not a question at all, please explain, Mr.\nJovanovi\u0107, how can one spend their holidays paying for it 7 kuna and in doing so,\nhas one paid or has one not paid VAT? (6/23, Question time, 6 April, 2011)\nIn the example (2) we can again see the same ironical form and guilt by association type of\nad hominem in the form of address as in the example (1). Prime Minister Kosor\u2019s answer to\nthe question, which she clearly perceives as an insult, is an example of circumstantial ad\nhominem attack, also known as the tu quoque (you too) (Krabbe and Walton, 1993; Walton,\n1998; Tindale, 2007) type of argument, which Croatian MPs use quite often. It represents a\ncase where the critic replies to a previous ad hominem attack by saying that the insult initiator\nis the same as the insult target and therefore cannot be accountable for delivering the criticism\nin the first place. It can also, according to Krabbe and Walton (1993: 82), serve as \u201ca sign of a\nshift to a quarrel\u2019, which is what the Prime Minister (3) tried to achieve, as she promptly\nreacted to an accusation with a counter-accusation. At the same time, in her counter attack,\ninstead of you she is using the indefinite pronoun one, which is marked for non-specificity.\nThis strategy is called defocalization (Haverkate, 1992: 516) which is \u201ca distancing technique\napplied by the speaker in order to minimize his/her own role or that of the hearer in the state\n274 of affairs described\u201c and is often found in the Croatian parliament when MPs try to mitigate\nassertive force of their accusations or insults.\nLike their British colleagues, Croatian MPs demonstrate constant parliamentary\ntransgressions directed towards opposite political parties i.e. political rather than rhetorical\npolarization (Ilie, 2004: 56). This type of polarization is based solely on party membership,\nand not on the ideology. The relationship between political camps shifts according to the\ncoalition formed and according to the power-shift.\n4.1.1. Diachronic aspect of (un)parliamentary polarization\nAs for the types of polarization, Croatian unparliamentary language has undergone a\nsignificant diachronic change. In the Second Term (1992-1995), insulting acts were primarily\npathos-oriented, just like the British ones (Ilie, 2004), which in the Croatian case can be\nexplained with the political and social situation (Croatian sovereignty, homeland security,\nneighboring country at war, war and post-war situation in Croatia, refugees etc.) at the time.\nChilton (2004) claims that political discourse has specific connections to the emotional\ncenters of the brain and that \u201csome politically relevant feelings, such as territorial belonging\nand identity (\u2018home\u2019), love of family, fear of intruders and unknown people (...) might have\nan innate basis and be stimulated automatically in the political use of language\u201c (2004: 204),\nwhich was especially perceptible in the terms following the Croatian independence. The\ndominant party at the time was CDU, right-wing party, with the predominant number of seats\nwon (85, as compared to the second largest, 14 won by CSLP) and most of the insults at the\ntime were pathos-oriented, group-identity oriented, with colorful metaphors, ad personam\nattacks and rhetorical questions, meaning you are either with us (Croats) or against us, i.e.\npro-Serbian, which is a typical example of non sequitur. A lot of insults were generally\naddressed towards decisions done by the government, and only isolated instances were\n275 personally drawn. Most of the MPs used pathos to construct their insult by appealing to the\ngeneral public, emphasizing what the wider audience was thinking and/or wanting to hear.\nThe example that follows shows the usage of ad hominem arguments and rhetorical questions\nfor a pathos-oriented strategy:\n(4) \u0110, \u0160. (HDZ): I dalje, predla\u017eem da se ukine smije\u0161ni zakon o oprostu \u010detnicima!\nTo je smije\u0161ni zakon! Gospodo, cijela se Europa smije Hrvatskoj da je oprostila\nnekakovim snagama koje vr\u0161e genocid, etnocid, memoricid nad hrvatskim narodom\njednako katoli\u010dke i muslimanske vjeroispovijesti, a da ovaj Sabor nije imao\nhrabrosti, a ja bih rekao ni pameti, da ka\u017ee s kim je to Hrvatska u ratu. Ja se pitam\ntko vodi pregovore sa dr\u017eavom koja nije pristala niti na primirje?! Pa, \u0161to smo mi,\njesmo li mi dje\u010dji vrti\u0107 ili smo Hrvatski parlament? (...) I, nemojte se ljutiti na\nmene vi, moji strana\u010dki kolege, jer Hrvatska demokratska zajednica je stvorena da\noslobodi hrvatski narod, a ne da se cjenka sa cincarima! (2/4, 4. studeni 1992.)\n\u0110, \u0160. (CDU): I propose to abolish the ridiculous Amnesty Act for Chetniks! This\nlaw is ridiculous! Gentlemen, the whole of Europe is laughing at Croatia for\nforgiving so called forces which perform genocide, ethnocide, memorycide against\nthe Croatian people, equally those of Catholic and Muslim faith, and that this\nParliament has not had the courage, and I would say neither the brains, to say who\nis it that Croatia is in war with. I wonder who is negotiating with the state that has\nagreed not even to a treaty?! Well, what are we, are we a nursery school or\nCroatian Parliament? (...) And, do not get mad at me, you, my party colleagues,\nbecause I believe that Croatian Democratic Union was created to liberate\nCroatian people, not to bargain with cheapskates! (2/4, November 4, 1992)\n276 Almost 20 year later, MPs in the Sixth Term (2008 - 2011) made a radical shift and started\nusing strategies closer to their Swedish colleagues, having much more \u201cethos-oriented logos\n\u201c (Ilie, 2004:56), especially since the debates in the 24th session preceded election time. These\ninsults are based on the argumentation that lies on the common presumption \u201cthat the quality\nof an act reveals the quality of the person responsible for it\u201c (Perelman and Olbrechts \u2013\nTyteca, 2008:70). Insults directed towards the target's ethos try to discredit the MP's personal\nqualities, gaining the attention of a multiple audience (Ilie, 2010b) and stirring an emotional\nreaction out of the political adversary (Ilie, 2004). These insults try to show that as a public\nperson, an MP represents a particular party and ideology, and is also responsible for\nimplementing its policies in a particular constituency and for promoting and acting in\naccordance with particular moral values and social norms. \u201cAt the same time, an MP is also a\ncitizen and a private person. On account of these multiple roles, all of which can be made\npublic to a certain extent, the institutional targets of insults are often more vulnerable, and\nconsequently much easier to harm\u201c (Ilie, 2001: 348).\nThe following example covers exactly these two roles of one MP, his multiple roles, taken\nas possible grounds for insulting his incompetence in entrepreneurial and managerial skills as\nan ex and future Minister.\n(5) S, \u0110. (HDZ): O \u010demu se radi, gospodine ministre Popija\u010d vas \u0107u pitati. Naime, radi\nse o jednom biv\u0161em ministru iz hvala Bogu biv\u0161e koalicijske vlasti od 2000. do\n2003. koji se obilato koristio svojim ministarskim mandatom i sklapao poslove u\nvrijednosti od 132 milijuna. No nije pitanje vezano uz to, pitanje je vezano\nnedavno on na radiju, televiziji grmi, grmi, grmi, borit \u0107emo se, mi kad do\u0111emo mi\n\u0107emo radnicima, pla\u0107e se ne ispla\u0107uju, a \u0161to se de\u0161ava? Upravo njegovih 17 tvrtki\nza koje je on interesno vezan, ne papirnato nego su one njegove, prenesao je, ne\nispla\u0107uju pla\u0107u svojim radnicima. Ovdje je 1000 radnika u igri koji ne primaju\n277 pla\u0107u, a on licemjerno la\u017ee ljudima u o\u010di i ka\u017ee da \u0107e se boriti protiv toga. Borit \u0107e\nse za ne\u0161to drugo, to je istina. Gospodine ministre, lijepo vas molim, \u0161to \u0107ete\nu\u010diniti i sa ostalim radnicima koje ovakvi tajkuni izrabljuju na razini robova ih\ndr\u017ee, ne ispla\u0107uju im pla\u0107u? (6/23, Aktualno prijepodne, 6. travnja 2011.)\nS, \u0110. (CDU): I will ask you, Minister Popija\u010d, what is it all about. The question is\nabout a former Minister who was part of, thank God, the former Coalition\nGovernment from 2000 to 2003, who had liberally used his ministerial mandate\nand mantled jobs valued at 132 million kunas. My question does not address that\nissue, but is related to his recent media appearance, where he shouts and storms,\nwe will fight, when we come (to power) the workers will be paid. Wages are not\npaid, and what is happening? His 17 companies for which he is bound by interest,\nnot only on paper, do not pay wages to their workers. We are talking about 1000\nworkers who do not receive a salary, while he is being a hypocrite and blatantly\nlying to their faces and saying he will fight against it. He will fight for something\nelse, that is for sure. Minister, I kindly ask you, what will you do with other\nworkers who are being exploited in a slave-like manner, and who are not being\npaid? (6/23, Question time, April 6, 2011)\nHere, we have several strategies being intertwined to use this ethos- oriented logos. The\nMP is using antonomasia, in order to avoid revealing the proper name of the insult target, but\nanyone who was even remotely familiar with the situation knew who s/he was referring to.\nAnother strategy the MP chose to use was praeteritio, by actually first incriminating the insult\ntarget and then asserting that this is not part of the question and that it is not relevant. We can\nsay that it makes a subversive ad personam attack. Also, we see some rhetorical questions\n278 that are again answered by the MP herself. Finally, juxtaposition of opposite notions, such as\ncorruption, lying vs. morals, is constantly emphasized throughout the question.\n4.2.(Un)parliamentary mitigation strategies in the Croatian parliament\nEvery MP knows that there are rules of conduct that should be obeyed in the Parliament.\nIn order to avoid institutional sanctions Croatian MPs often resort to mitigation strategies.\nFraser (1980 qtd. in Haverkate 1992: 505) says that mitigation serves to disguise the intention\nof the speaker for the purpose of reducing \u201cunwelcome effects of his/her performing a certain\nkind of speech act\u201c. The most common mitigation strategies are very similar to those found in\nboth British and Swedish parliaments (Ilie, 2004) such as a) attribution transfer strategy, b)\njuxtaposition of opposite notions and c) the formulation of insults as questions rather than as\nstatements.\n4.2.1. Attribution transfer strategy\nIlie (2004: 59) defines it as usage of \u201cindirect attribution strategies in order to avoid taking\ndirect responsibility for using derogatory qualifiers to characterise someone\u201c. Basically, what\nthe MPs do is they transfer the negative qualifier to the target\u2019s acts or statements rather than\ndirectly insulting the person. The following examples show how Croatian MPs transfer the\ninsult to some abstract notion (procedure) instead of directly insulting another MP or his/her\nparty:\n(6) N, D. (HSLS): (...) Ukoliko zakonom propisani postupak procjene utjecaja na\nokoli\u0161 nije zadovoljavaju\u0107i, (...) potrebno ga je dopuniti, a ne propisivati paralelan\npostupak koji \u0107e kao i postoje\u0107i prvenstveno slu\u017eiti za pranje novca (...). ( 4/36, 3.\nrujna 2003.)\n279 N, D. (SocLib): (...) If legally prescribed procedure on the environmental impact\nassessment is not satisfactory, (...), it is necessary to supplement it, and not to\nprescribe a parallel procedure that will, as the existing one, primarily serve for\nmoney laundering (...). (4/36, September 3, 2003)\nIt is obvious that it is not the procedure, but the people behind it (and implicitly, the ruling\nparty) that the MP is trying to disqualify. Another instance of attribution transfer strategy,\ncommonly used by the Croatian MPs, is non- specific reference to the insult target (also see\nexample (5)). Unlike the former example, where the insult initiator is trying to mitigate\nhis/her insult through insulting the target\u2019s acts or statements or some abstract notion, in the\nfollowing example the initiator avoids directly mentioning the insult target\u2019s name, and\ninstead uses a description of his actions. It is more than clear who the MP is referring to, but\nnowhere in the whole process does s/he name the person in question and therefore s/he can\ndistance her/himself from the direct derogatory attribution:\n(7) B, D. (HSLS): Dame i gospodo, ako ste osoba protiv koje je podnijeto desetak\nkaznenih prijava, ako sami u svojim intervjuima dajete izjave koje ukazuju da ste i\nsami po\u010dinili, osim tih prijava kaznena djela, \u0161to je vama u\u010diniti? Oti\u0107i na jahtu,\npredsjednika dr\u017eave, to je inovacija. Ili na topovnja\u010du. Ispovjediti se bez pokore,\ndobiti razrje\u0161enje. I ne samo to, nego jo\u0161 i sklopiti posao i jo\u0161 sklopiti posao u\ndrugoj zemlji, a hrvatska politika \u0161uti, politi\u010dke stranke \u0161ute, mediji o tome govore,\nali Ministarstvo pravosu\u0111a se ne o\u010dituje o toj strani s eti\u010dkog i politi\u010dkog gledi\u0161ta\n(...). (4/36, 4. rujna 2003.)\nB, D. (SocLib): Ladies and gentlemen, if you are a person against whom a dozen\ncriminal charges have been filed, if you alone in your interviews give statements\nindicating that you have committed those crimes, apart for those criminal charges,\n280 what would you do? Go to the President\u2019s yacht, well, that\u2019s a new one. Or on the\ngunboat. Confess without repentance, get absolution. Not only that, but still be\nable to make a deal and do business in another country, and all the while, Croatian\npolitics is silent, the political parties are silent, the media talk about it, but the\nMinistry of Justice does not give any statements about this from either an ethical or\npolitical standpoint (...). (4/36, September 4, 2003)\n4.2.2. The formulation of insults as questions rather than as statements\nAnother recurring mitigation strategy of Croatian MPs is to use questions rather than\nstatements. They serve to introduce \u201cready-made assumptions and prejudicial ideas\u201c (Ilie,\n2004:59). Quite often they are in the form of repetitious Wh-questions, which are often\nrhetorical because the answer is obvious, insulting or incriminating.\n(8) K, M. (HSLS): Ho\u0107e li temeljem ovoga zakona kazneno odgovarati primjerice\nBrodogradili\u0161te Viktor Lenac i donedavni predsjednik uprave gospodin Vrhovnik\nzbog obmanjivanja Vlade o poslovnim rezultatima te tvrtke? Pa je onda obmanuta\nVlada toj tvrtki izdala 60 milijuna ili 60-tak milijuna dolara dr\u017eavnih jamstava.\nHo\u0107e li odgovarati Rije\u010dka banka? Ho\u0107e li primjerice odgovarati Hrvatski fond za\nprivatizaciju koji je evidentno zlouporabom ovlasti recimo gospodinu \u0160troku\nomogu\u0107io vlasni\u0161tvo nad Otokom \u017eivota? Ili \u0107e pak ovaj zakon pogoditi neke\nsitnije ribe i ribice koje ne plivaju u onom pravcu koji se vladaju\u0107ima svi\u0111a (4/36,\n4. rujna 2003)\n281 K, M. (SocLib): Will, for example, shipyard Viktor Lenac and its, till recent CEO\nMr. Vrhovnik, be held criminally liable due to misleading the Government about\nthe business results of the company? And then that misled government issued 60\nmillion, or 60-odd million dollars of government loan guarantees to that company.\nWill Rije\u010dka banka be held accountable? Will, for instance, Croatian Privatisation\nFund, also be accountable, which by abuse of authority enabled Mr. \u0160trok to\nbecome a proprietor of Island of Life? Or will this legislation catch some smaller\nfish and fishes that do not swim in the direction suitable to the ruling party? (4/36,\nSeptember 4, 2003)\nThis is an example of an insult in the form of multiple, multi-layered wh-questions. We\ncan argue that they are fallacious, as they contain more questions piled together in an\napparently single question (Ilie, 2004), which could be read as an attempt to show the\ncorruption and lack of good judgment of the ruling party. Moreover, they function more as\nrhetorical questions than the real ones, as the MP provides a scornful answer to them at the\nend. Questions in the example contain repetition (Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 2008),\nprecisely anaphora (will be held accountable), which serves to accentuate a point and\nincrease the \u201cfeeling of presence\u201c (2008: 175) of arguments. Repetition is one of the surest\nand easiest ways to make arguments more pronounced and less surprising, and this is exactly\nwhat the MP tried to achieve.\n(9) K, D. (IDS): Da li ste tome pritvoreniku iz Salzburga, da ne ka\u017eem kriminalcu,\nkako ga predstavljaju mediji, ijednom rekli gospodine Sanaderu, prijatelju, dru\u017ee,\nkamaradu, gospodine, ekscelencijo, pretjerali ste, dosta toga. Nije valjda da niste\nmogli naslutiti kamo ide njegova samovolja. (...) ali ministri znali su u 90%\nslu\u010dajeva \u0161to se zapravo zbiva u Vladi, kod \u010dovjeka koji je, tako mediji govore,\n282 90% radio mimo zakona, a svega 10% valjda u skladu sa zakonom. (6/24, 28.\nrujna 2011.)\nK, D. (IstrianDem): Have you ever said to this detainee from Salzburg, I will not\nuse the word criminal, as the media call him, Mr. Sanader, friend, comrade,\ncompadre, Sir, Your Excellency, you have gone too far, it\u2019s enough. Is it possible\nthat you could not have guessed where his autocracy was leading. (...) but the\nministers knew in 90% of the cases what was actually going on in the government,\nwith the man who was, as the media claim, 90% of the time working on the other\nside of the law, and only 10%, I suppose, in accordance with the law. (6/24,\nSeptember 28, 2011)\nThis example shows ad hominem attacks and irony in the form of rhetorical question, but it\nalso displays a brilliant usage of the deictic device called hedge (Lakoff, 1972). The MP first\nuses an ad hominem attack to say that the former Prime Minister is a criminal, but then uses\nthe mitigating effect of the hedge, in this case the media, to avoid making the impression that\nhe is personally responsible for the assessment, and thus modifies the force of the insult so\nthat he cannot be accountable for something someone else said. This example also displays\nthe usage of etiquette and forms of address as an opportunity to insult (see also example (1)).\nThe rhetorical figure of irony stems from ridicule that is, according to Perelman and\nOlbrechts-Tyteca (2008: 207), \u201coften achieved through clever deductions drawn from what\none is trying to criticize\u201c. Here, the MP is criticizing and trying to insult the leading party\nmembers by accusing them of knowing what was going on at the time.\n283 4.2.3. Juxtaposition of opposite notions: Democracy, morality vs. communism,\ncorruption, lying\nCroatian MPs use juxtapositions of opposite notions as a possible mitigation strategy. This\nis usually done by using the rhetorical figure of antithesis which has two contrasting ideas\nintentionally juxtaposed. Demetrius (Dean Anderson Jr., 2000: 21) says that \u201cthe use of\nantithesis makes the speaker both gravis and ornatus\u201c, i.e. important, serious, and his speech\nelegant and ornate.\nDiachronically, during the 90\u2019s (2nd and 3rd Term), the notion that was used as a way of\nmitigating an insulting strategy was democracy vs. communism/old habits. In the terms that\nfollowed, these notions were mainly used by the right-wing parties when they wanted to\naccuse the Left of preferring the previous system more. Later on, morality vs. corruption\ncame up in face-threatening acts. It is of no surprise, since MPs' vulnerability can easily be\nenhanced by attacking the MPs\u2019 ethos through his/her wrongdoings, i.e. lying, cheating and\ncorruption. These notions at first seem different from respect vs. contempt used by British and\nSwedish MPs (Ilie, 2004), but implicitly they are the same, since it is known that people who\nare corrupt and lie deserve contempt, as opposed to those who are honorable, fair and deserve\nrespect. The following example shows the constant juxtaposition of these notions:\n(10) C, Z. ( HDZ): Kako \u0107ete postaviti tu moralnu dvojbu i prozivati ljude koji nisu\nhtjeli stati [na va\u0161u stranu] na temelju tih va\u0161ih nemoralnih postupaka u politici jer\njedno govorite drugo radite, a s druge strane optu\u017eite Hrvatsku demokratsku\nzajednicu da bi trebala biti u takvim situacijama moralna i prepustiti vama\npoliti\u010dku vlast (...). Pa prema tome, budimo realni, vi koji stvarate jednu areolu\ntobo\u017enje demokrati\u010dnosti. Tko bi u tom slu\u010daju trebao dobiti mjesto predsjednika\nskup\u0161tine ili gradona\u010delnika? (3/22 5. studenoga 1997.)\n284 C, Z. (CDU): How do you plan to set up this moral dilemma and single out people\nwho would not choose [your side] on the basis of these immoral actions in politics,\nbecause you say one thing and do another, and on the other hand, you accuse\nCroatian Democratic Union and say that in such situations it should behave\nmorally and give you the political power (...). Therefore, let's be realistic, you who\ntry to create a halo of the so-called democracy. In that case, who should be made a\npresident of the assembly or a mayor? (3/22, November 5, 1997)\nAccording to Aristotle (qtd. in Demetrius 1902: 267) \u201cthe merit of an antithetical style is\nthat it brings contraries into emphatic juxtaposition\u201c. These notions are paired in order to\ncreate, in this case, an ethical dilemma between two moral imperatives out of which only one\nis preferable. The opposition serves to emphasise and further accentuate the difference\nbetween these two notions. The example carries an underlying message that a party that is\nimmoral does not deserve to be in power. MPs use corruption, cheating, lying, and immoral\nactions to discredit and insult the opposing MPs or their parties.\n4.3. In-group identity and inter-group dissent\nCroatian group identification depends solely on the party or coalition formed and is not\nbased on the similarities or differences in the interpretation of socio-political events. It also\npurely depends on the individual\u2019s political identity and how much does s/he feel like a part\nof the group. The goal of these insults is to weaken the authority of the adversaries, whether\nbe it an individual MP or his/her party, as \u201cindividuals influence our impression of the group\n285 to which they belong, and, conversely, what we think of the group predisposes us to a\nparticular impression of those who form it\u201c (Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 2008: 322).\nInsults to show in-group identity are often expressed by using irony (see also examples (1),\n(2), (7), (9)). It is a rhetorical figure where \u201cone seeks to convey the opposite of what one\nactually says\u201c (Dumarsais qtd. in Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 2008: 207) and the\napplication of the same device is antiphrasis, which is a deliberate ironic use of inadequate\nillustration by reference to qualifications. These qualifications are assigned to a person and\nrepresent a generally accepted statement illustrated by someone\u2019s behaviour (Perelman and\nOlbrechts-Tyteca, 2008). The following example shows how an MP is displaying her/his in-\ngroup membership by using a deliberately inadequate illustration to ironically insult the other\ngroup (ruling party):\n(11) H, M. (SDP): Samo je vama uspjelo po\u0107i za rukom da broj za nezaposlenost raste\ni ljeti. To zaista treba znati i to je zaista odli\u010dna realizacija programa\ngospodarskog oporavka. I tako danas imamo 300 tisu\u0107a nezaposlenih upravo\nzahvaljuju\u0107i va\u0161oj sposobnosti. Vjerujemo da \u0107e gra\u0111ani tu va\u0161u sposobnost\nnagraditi na sljede\u0107im izborima (6 /24, 28. rujna 2011.)\nH. M. (SocDem): Only you have succeeded in having unemployment rates\nincreasing even during the summer. It is really not easy to pull it off and that\u2019s a\nreally great realization of the economic recovery program. And so today we have\n300 thousand unemployed thanks to your competence. We believe that the citizens\nwill reward this competence in the next election (6/24, September 28, 2011)\n286 5. Conclusion\nThe line between criticisms, accusations, and disparaging, derogatory terms perceived as\ninsults is very fuzzy and sometimes difficult to establish. Insults are achieved via both\nlinguistic and extralingusitic cues and are contextually defined. Most of the time, insults made\nby the Croatian MPs serve to interact with other interlocutors and reaffirm the party position\nrepresented by a particular MP, at the same time undermining the insult target and\nconsequentially the party represented by this particular MP. They also serve as attention-\ngetters, in which case the insult is \u201cusually directed for the benefit of an on-looking audience\nand with the intent to strengthen the silencer\u2019s own position\u201c (Tindale, 2007:90). The\naudience that the insult initiator has in mind is often wider than the one in the session hall and\nwe could define it as \u201ca third party consisting of the spectators\u201c (Eemeren and Grootendorst,\n2004: 178) i.e. reporters, journalists, and constituency members (Ilie, 2010b).\nThere are various cues for insult recognition, usually ad hominem/ad personam attacks,\nnotions such as corruption, lies, morale, irony and sarcasm, forms of address, rhetorical\nquestions, together with the expressive force of the insult instigator and the conception of\nwhat an insult is by the MP her/himself. Many of the insults are done in the form of rectifying\nthe incorrect statement, when MPs have a right to correct a statement previously discussed.\nResponses to insults are individual, sometimes it is the addressee that responds and sometimes\nsomeone else (Speaker, other MP of the same party). MPs often use the response to an insult\nto make an insult themselves or shift the topic of discussion.\nMPs position themselves only along the party lines. This shows that the possible common\nideology behind the same-wing parties does not play any significant role in the Croatian\nParliament. The frequency of insult initiators is purely individual and there are certain MPs\nwho use unparliamentary language more often than others, which basically serves to promote\ntheir own image in a highly competitive environment. There is no gender\u2013dependent\n287 difference between insult initiator/s or target/s, which can be linked to Ki\u0161i\u010dek\u2019s (2008)\nresearch, which showed that there were no significant differences between female and male\nrhetoric in politics.\nPreferred insulting strategies are pathos and ethos-oriented insults to show political\npolarization, juxtaposition of opposite notions such as democracy vs. communism, morality vs.\ncorruption/lies; insults as (rhetorical) questions, attribution transfer strategy, defocalization,\nirony and sarcasm.\nOver time, insulting practices in the Croatian Parliament have changed from pathos-\noriented logos to ethos-oriented logos. Notions used for mitigation strategies have also\nchanged from more abstract (democracy) to more specific (corruption, bribe, lies) ones. The\nusage of unparliamentary language was prompted by the introduction of spoken and lower\nregisters into a highly institutionalized place, which opened up new possibilities for linguistic\nexpression.\nCroatian MPs show similar insulting and mitigation strategies as both British and Swedish\ncolleagues. Still, we must conclude that, when compared in closer detail, they behave more\nlike the British MPs, i.e. they display a \u201cconfrontation-seeking tendency\u201c (Ilie, 2004:54),\npolarization which is more political than rhetorical, balance between terms of respect and\ncontempt, irony and direct insults. Diachronically, in the 2nd and 3rd Terms Croatian MPs\nbehave more like the British MPs using pathos-oriented insults and in later terms more like\ntheir Swedish counterparts, using ethos-oriented insults (Ilie, 2004), by attacking the other\nMPs\u2019 personal values and acts and discrediting their credibility.\nOn many occasions, there have been instances of very harsh and rude insults by the\nCroatian MPs that have been discussed even in the news (e.g. that women are known to be\ngood in bed, but not in places where intelligence is necessary), but they were not part of our\nrandomly selected corpus. Still, it is inevitable to conclude that the insults are becoming more\n288 and more direct and used with less constraints than before. Whether the common usage of\ninsults promotes democracy and shows development of parliamentary discourse remains open.\nWe believe that is important to be verbally polite \u201cin order to maintain harmonious, efficient\ninteraction\u201c (Held, 2005: 303) which, we think, is a sign of democracy, more than insults will\never be.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the Croatian Parliament, especially the Information and\nDocumentation Department headed by Ms. Daniela Sraga Ph.D. who patiently responded to\nall our requests.\nReferences\nAustin, J.

LEGAL DISCOURSE\n293 Taking Judges Seriously\nArgumentation and Rhetoric in Legal Decisions\nMaurizio Manzin, Research Centre on Legal Methodology (CERMEG), University of Trento\nSummary\nLogical evidence in legal reasoning is one of the most important criteria for evaluating the soundness and legal\ncongruence of Courts\u2019 decisions. In Italy such a principle has been fixed in art. 360.1.5 CPC (the Italian Civil\nProcedure Code), art. 606.1.e CPP (the Italian Criminal Procedure Code) and by a number of judgments by the\nSupreme Court. Logical proof in Courts\u2019 opinions is usually related to the paradigm of \u201clegal syllogism\u201d: a\npractical syllogism whose major premise is given by the statute law and whose minor one is given by the facts\nunder judgment. In this article I argue that the premises of legal syllogisms are not precisely given, but rather\nbuilt, thanks to an linked process of (rhetorical) argumentation. Such process can be divided into gradual steps,\neach of them logically reliable: my aim is to outline a preliminary description of these phases as capable of being\nconceptualized and improved upon by the judge and to furnish a reliable scheme for Supreme Court judges,\nallowing them to check the logical consistency of lower Courts\u2019 opinions. My aim is to provide lawyers and\nprosecutors with some recommendations which may help them to achieve effective argumentation.\nKey words: legal argumentation, legal language, legal reasoning, legal syllogism, rhetoric\nLogic and the law in the main Italian legal sources\nWhat does logic have to do with legal decisions? Answering this question implies\ndescribing the nature of legal reasoning, because we need to establish whether the reliability\nof the decisions in trials depends upon some formal schemes of deduction or if it concerns\nother modalities of evidence.\nA rapid overview of some sources of Italian legal system will provide some previous\nguidelines for dealing with the question. In particular, one must refer to the Italian codes of\nCivil (CPC) and Criminal (CPP) procedure. Art. 360.1.5 CPC assumes that a judgment is\ninvalid if the reasoning relating to a crucial and controversial fact is \u201clacking\u201d, \u201cinsufficient\u201d\nor \u201ccontradictory\u201d. Beside that and in a very similar way, art. 606.1.e CPP specifies that a\n294 judgment is invalid if the argument is \u201clacking or clearly illogical\u201d57. Briefly, according to\nItalian codified law, decisions must be considered invalid when the argument is \u201cinsufficient\u201d,\n\u201ccontradictory\u201d or \u201cclearly illogical\u201d and consequently judges are asked to know what logical\nconsistency clearly is and whether it is sufficient or not. Consistency which does not appear to\nbe perfectly coherent logically (such as, for instance, in Tarski, 1994), since the Legislator\nmentions the contradiction as one kind of bad argument alongside others (i. e. insufficiency\nand clear illogicality), not treating it as the only possible one. So we must conclude that for\nserious judges \u2013 and namely the ones in the Italian Supreme Court (s.c. Corte di Cassazione)\n\u2013 the problems are the following:\n1. to determine when a legal argument is contradictory;\n2. to determine when it is clearly illogical (but not necessarily contradictory);\n3. to determine when it is insufficient;\n4. to determine when there is no argument at all (lacking).\nAll these commitments imply precise viewpoints on logic and argumentative sufficiency on\nthe judges\u2019 part. A very difficult task, it must be conceded, for which no codified rules are\nprovided and leaving perhaps too much space for free will and responsibility. Are Italian\njudges (especially those in higher Courts) prepared to do that?\nThe modern formalistic heritage\nThe fact is that Italian legal culture has been influenced for a very long time by a\nformalistic model of reasoning, dating back to the ideas of thinkers like Charles-Louis de\nMontesquieu (La Br\u00e8de 1689 - Paris 1755) and Cesare Beccaria (Milan, 1738 - 1794): authors\nwho adopted a basic presupposition about the paradigm of certainty in knowledge. They\nthought that no interpretation should be admitted in legal decisions, because such a practice by\n57 It is important to notice that in Italian Civil and Criminal procedure, the judge must always declare the grounds\nof decision in his/her judgment and not only the purview (so-called \u201cobligatory nature of the motivation\u201d).\n295 judges would lead to unpredictability and arbitrariness, whereas citizens have the right to\nknow exactly what to do or not to do and what consequences they risk in doing or not doing\nsomething (Beccaria, 1982; Montesquieu, 1994). According to such a conviction, the right\nthing would be to have clear and durable written norms, similar to the axioms of the formal\nsciences and established by an effective authority (the souverain: a king or a parliament).\nWith norms like these, the judge\u2019s task would consist exclusively in recognizing when a fact\nis relevant as a species of the normative genus: a truly logical operation of \u201cdeduction\u201d from a\ngeneral and unambiguous list of obligatory behaviours and sanctions. This is the so-called\n\u201clegal syllogism\u201d which I am going to describe in more detail in this article. But for the\nmoment let us pause a moment, and ask what idea of \u201clogic\u201d is in step with such a model of\nreasoning (for an overview on logic in history: Blanch\u00e9 & Dubucs, 1996; Varzi et al., 2004).\nWe usually say that something is \u201clogical\u201d either when it is strongly linked to one or more\npremises, or when it is part of an ordered scheme. In the former sense we admit for instance\nthat having determined that all black birds are (named) ravens, if we find a black bird it must\nlogically be (named as) a raven; in the latter sense we can, for instance, say that just because\nyesterday was Monday today must logically be Tuesday, having previously established (or\naccepted) a scheme of consequence about the series of the (names of the) days. In other\nwords, \u201clogic\u201d means that a certain conclusion \u2013 (the name) raven or (the name) Tuesday \u2013 is\nobligatory because some premises have been established or at least accepted by participants in\nthe discourse.\nThe formula of such an argument can be expressed in the most general terms as if P then Q.\nIt implies (at least) that:\n1. one or more premises (P) do exist in the discourse before the argument;\n2. this or these premises are clearly understood as P and not as other than P by\nparticipants in the discourse;\n296 3. this or these premises are accepted by participants in the discourse;\n4. one and only one connection can be found between P and Q, avoiding arguments\nlike if P then Q or other then Q.\nFrom the modern point of view (the one of Montesquieu and Beccaria) argument if P then\nQ can be guaranteed by the immutability of the premises (P=P) according to the basic\nprinciple of identity. We must imagine a closed circle of reasoning in which all possible Qs\n(such as raven or Tuesday) are ab initio part of the genre P (such as black birds or week). The\nclosure of this circle depends on the impossibility of disputing the existence of the premises\n(pt. 1 in the list above), their univocal comprehension (pt. 2), their acceptance (pt. 3), the\nexistence of one and only one possible connection with Q (pt. 4). Obviously, this is a very\nhard set of conditions to achieve in contexts which are neither formal nor monological (and\nthe trial is just one of these, being linguistically unformalised and dialogical in structure),\nalthough authors like Montesquieu and Beccaria maintained that legal science must deal with\nthe sciences par excellence, such as mathematics or physics.\n3. A classical meaning of logic\nBut is this the only possible way to say that something is \u201clogical\u201d? If we look at classical\nthought we can find a different point of view, according to which \u201clogic\u201d means \u201cbelonging to\nlogos\u201d58: an original activity (not created by men\u2019s thinking but rather anticipating it) allowing\nmen\u2019s speeches to name the things with a variety of words (difference), obtaining however a\nunity of sense (identity). A \u201cdivine\u201d power for Heraclitus and later Plato; the revelation of the\nBeing for Aristotle, who wrote: \u201cBeing is said in many ways\u201d (Metaph. \uf047 2, 1003a 32-33). So\n\u201clogic\u201d in a classical perspective does not mean compulsory in one and only one way, because\n58 In this context the opposite terms \u201cclassical\u201d and \u201cmodern\u201d are used not in a chronological sense but in a\nconceptual one. In fact, there have been in ancient and medieval times some positions conceptually modern (as\nfor instance those of Anaxagoras, Zeno, most of Neoplatonic authors etc.) and, vice versa, in the modern age\nsome others conceptually classical (as, in the very beginning of it, Petrarch) (Manzin, 1994, 2008).\n297 there are many ways at men\u2019s disposal: many methods are provided for seeking the unity of\nsense among the multiplicity of situations. The classical account is essentially dynamic,\nwhereas the modern one is static (more similar to the Ephesian philosophies: on this recently,\nPuppo, 2012). Perelman would have probably said that while classical thought tends to\nargumentation, the modern and Cartesian one prefers demonstration (Manzin, 2004, 2012a).\nThese two tours d\u2019esprit about logic are supported by two different metaphysics or\nconceptions of Being: for Plato and Aristotle, Being is \u201cdiscontinuous\u201d, while for Cartesius or\nHume it is \u201ccontinuous\u201d\n(i.e. coherent in every part of itself, either from an analytical or empirical point of view: see\nManzin, 2008, 2009). In order to avoid the thaumazein, every single thing must be linked to\nthe other, with no vacuum in the middle. The goal of modern logic, and particularly of formal\nlogic, is \u201cto study such links not in order to explain their nature, but rather and above all to\nmake a concise catalogue of few and simple rules with them\u201d (Lolli: 1991, 13); the advantage\nof this choice is evident, it is a practical one: knowing in advance the conclusions on the\nexclusive ground of knowing the causal relations.\nThanks to Boole and Frege, modern logic will finally conduct reasoning to artificial\nlanguages and to \u201cmathematization\u201d (Agazzi & Vassallo, 1998: 33-45).\n. The legal syllogism\nWhen we speak about logic in legal decisions are we assuming that legal reasoning is also\na matter of discourses? In that case, it depends simply on what sort of logic we are talking\nabout. For modern logic, the more certain a decision must be, the more it must avoid\ndiscursive forms, because the judge, as Montesquieu argued, must play the unique role of\nloudspeaker of the written norms. He/she is \u201cla bouche de la loi\u201d (the mouth of the law), but\npossibly not the brain. He/she must repeat rather than speak, for speech is a slippery slope\n298 where thaumazein can occur at any moment. We can never forget that the modern ideology of\nlegal positivism is founded upon a double (axiomatic) presupposition: the completeness and\nunivocity of the legal system itself. On the contrary, discourses in the real world are never\ncomplete or univocal (Endicott, 2003; Luzzati, 1990; Paganini, 2008; Puppo, 2011, 2012).\nAlthough such a presupposition is no longer professed by most legal positivists, a large\nproportion of lawyers and judges are still convinced that legal reasoning is basically a\n\u201csubsumption\u201d, that is, a logical deduction from a normative major premise and a factual\n(descriptive) minor one. There are, indeed, different discourses from the legal point of view:\ndepending on the speaking subject (the Legislator, the judge, the positive law scholar, the\nprosecutor, the lawyer etc.), on the context (before, during or outside the trial), on the issue\n(norms, principles, judicial proceedings etc.).\nI am now going to consider the judge\u2019s discourse in detail, in so far as it is directed at\narriving at a legal decision. My aim is to show that the so-called \u201clegal syllogism\u201d,\nmasquerading as a formal scheme of reasoning independent from interpretation, is conversely,\nby its own nature argumentative. To do so, I will start by considering the formula of the\nsyllogism as follows (Alexy, 1978; Rotolo, 2001; Bernal, 2013):\nMajor Premise: (1) \uf022x(Px \u2192 MQx)\nMinor Premise: (2) Pa\nConclusion: (3) MQa (1) (2)\nTo be a legal syllogism (which is a kind of \u201cpractical syllogism\u201d) such a logical operation\nmust have the following structure:\n1. (Normative) Major Premise: a general rule connecting a sanction to a course of\nconduct. Premise (1) states that, for every x, if x is P (and P is for instance the set of\n299 features of the type of offence), then the sanction Q (such as, for instance,\ndetention) must be applied to x. In a general and informal way: people having\ncommitted P must be submitted to measure Q.\n2. (Factual) Minor Premise: a concrete event which has happened to someone.\nPremise (2) states that a specific legal case a is P since it has the same features as\nx. In a general and informal way: B has committed P.\n3. Conclusion or \u201csubsumption\u201d: a necessary inference. Since, according to minor\npremise (2), a is P, the rule expressed in major premise (1) applies to a: then Q\nmust be valid for a. In a general and informal way: B must be subject to the\nmeasure Q.\nAccording to the founders of modern legal positivism the judge charged with deciding the\ncase (we are referring particularly to trials in Civil Law systems) already has the elements for\nfinding both the normative major premise (the codified law in the hierarchy of legal sources)\nand the minor one (the rules of evidence). His/her task is hence \u201cto subsume the latter under\nthe former\u201d in order to logically obtain the conclusion. A totally \u201cautomatic\u201d task, as stressed\nby Montesquieu and Beccaria.\n5. Some problems relating to the syllogistic model\nThis logical scheme of inference isn\u2019t wrong in itself, but it counts only as a final operation\nin which all elements have been previously determined. Indeed, if we look at the judicial\ncontext in the real world, we can easily realize that the judge at the beginning of his/her\nreasoning has no clear elements to work with. The normative major premise (1), for instance,\n300 \u201cexists\u201d only as a set of potential meanings related to some statements written in (what has\nbeen recognised as) the books of law.\nSo the judge has first of all to choose one or more normative statements from the books\nand, in the second case, also a combination between them (it is not unusual in fact that more\nthan one statement could satisfy the judge\u2019s search for a normative qualification of the\nreported behaviour of S and, consequently, that more than one combination could be possible\nwithin different statements); secondly he/she must interpret the legal statements according to\ngrammar, syntax and lexis: an operation allowing the judge to detect a significance for legal\nstatements relating to the concrete situation of the circularity between the judge\nhimself/herself, the case and the system of normative sources, which is possible only within\nthe framework of the pragmatic referents. Only after such a complex procedure as this can the\n(serious) judge establish a (still provisional) major premise for his/her final decision.\nOf course during the phases of the interpretative process, many criteria can be proposed to\njustify the choice of the legal statement(s), their possible combination and even the pragmatic\nreferents: the trial is a place of dialogue and controversy, and different actors are there\nprecisely for providing a number of criteria to identify the normative genre which the disputed\nbehaviour of S should be traced back to. That is why I say that the major premise of the so-\ncalled \u201clegal syllogism\u201d is not given, but must be found following a typical argumentative\nprocess. For this reason, this phase of legal reasoning cannot be defined as formal under any\nrespect, nor can the reasoning itself be taken as being \u201c automatic\u201d (i. e. without choice ).\nBelieving that the major premise of the syllogism was immediately available to the judge,\nmodern legal formalists have focused their attention on the minor one that, arising from events\nwhich had occurred in the past had to be discovered by the judge through the rules of evidence\n(Taruffo, 2009). Such an operation \u2013 the description of a \u201cfact\u201d \u2013 is seemingly similar to an\nempirical proof: an observer (the judge) must verify the description of what actually (or at\n301 least more probably) happened and answer the question: did B commit or not commit P?, just\nas a scientist has to explain the modalities of a specific event (e.g. is the hole in the ozone\nlayer responsible for global warming, or not?). This account tends to look at the trial as a sort\nof \u201cneutral\u201d laboratory, where the more scientific the approach to the judgment, the more the\ndecision itself will be guaranteed (Manzin, 2004).\nThe fact is that the rules of evidence are quite different from empirical procedures, though\nthey sometimes make use of scientific tools. First of all, they are rules in the sense that they\nprescribe what, when and how such tools can be legitimately used (whereas from this point of\nview, scientists are much more, although not totally, free); secondly, the legitimation of\nevidence does not necessarily depend on its efficacy (while the effectiveness of technical\ninstruments is essential in empirical proof); thirdly, the most widely-used \u201cinstrument\u201d for\nobtaining evidence \u2013 the witness \u2013 would normally be unacceptable from a strictly scientific\nviewpoint: what medical journal, for example, would publish an article about a crucial\nscientific discovery resting only upon the testimony of a few witnesses?\nScientific contexts and legal ones\nUpon reflection, I am quite convinced that there is a fundamental difference between\nscientific contexts (either formal or empirical) and legal ones.\nA scientific context is:\ni. monological\nii. linguistically artificial\niii. moving from hypothesis and axioms stipulated in advance.\nOn the contrary, a legal context is:\ni'. dialogical (as the trial\u2019s structure clearly shows)\nii'. linguistically vague\n302 iii'. moving from various possible starting points (topoi).\nAt any point in the debate, legal actors can advance a particular point of view about\nnormative interpretation, factual description, or logical connection. Each of them can choose\nfrom an open set of opinions the one(s) that is (are) thought to be effective for building a\nreasonable and persuasive discourse: a truly argumentative task performed by lawyers, the\nprosecutor (in a criminal trial), mediators, and even expert witnesses and witnesses, all giving\nthe judge a variety of interpretations, descriptions and inferences as possible premises (1) and\n(2), and conclusions (3), for his/her reasoning.\nMoreover, it should be noted that the legal conclusion reached by the judge has the power\nto oblige someone to do or to suffer something. The judge must decide and his/her decision\nmust be applied (subjective and objective obligation) by reason of his/her normative\nauthority, and not only as a result of the logical consistency or the empirical evidence of\nhis/her reasoning \u2013 a fundamental difference from authority in science, which is based mainly\nupon coherence and verifiability.\nIn conclusion, since legal argumentation is not a matter of science, we could conclude\nthat it simply has to do with the legitimate power of the judge (\u201cauctoritas non veritas facit\nlegem\u201d: Scarpelli, 1984). But this cannot be sustained, because a mere expression of power,\neven if authorized by the law, cannot properly be an argumentation; on the contrary, from an\nargumentative point of view, it is a fallacy (see for instance argumentum ad baculum or ad\nmetum). This is also the reason why a number of constitutional principles and rules preserve\nthe reasonableness of legal judgments (as set by before quoted arts. 360 CPC and 606 CPP).\nThe will of the judge certainly plays a central role in legal decisions, but the domain involving\nan exercise of will cannot be the only one in which either general or individual rules are\ngiven: reasonable elements are required in addition to assure a just judgment.\n303 The next question is: how to obtain a reasonable argument in legal context, which is not a\nmerely scientific one? A typically methodological question indeed.\n7. Rhetoric and the law\nA logic suitable for a context that is dialogical, controversial, linguistically vague and\ngoverned-by-commonplaces \u2013 such as the legal one \u2013 must face a number of problematic\nissues, which are unfamiliar to the procedures of formal logic (Eemeren et al., 1996).\nFirst of all, in a polemical dialogue monitored by an impartial \u201cthird party\u201d (the judge or\nthe jury), actors struggle to draw the decision-maker\u2019s attention. Consequently, they need\nsome strategies for giving their discourses an attractive appeal. Especially in the initial phase\nof argumentation, actors should provide aesthetic and emotional means through their attitude\n(actio) and speech (elocutio) in order to strike the audience: a logic of pathos in which both\nbody and language are involved to prepare further reasoning and to invite listeners to\nappreciate the actor\u2019s own argument (protrepticon) (on the role of pathos in language and\nargumentation: Plantin, 2011).\nSuch concern for material and linguistic tactics for eliciting pathos should not be limited to\nthe very first steps of argumentation59, for we should not forget that a legal context remains\ndialogical and controversial from the beginning to the end; so actors must be on their guard at\nevery moment, if they want to avoid audience inattention or emotional vacuums (Manzin,\n2010).\nThe aesthetic aspect of argumentation, being a peculiar connotation of rhetoric, came to be\nconsidered dominant especially during the modern age, when formal procedures of reasoning\nincreasingly acquired a condition of exclusivity in Western thought. But from a broader (and\n59 As maintained for instance by F. Cavalla, according to whom the sole purpose of aesthetic in rhetorical\nargumentation is the captatio during the starting phase (Cavalla, 2007).\n304 classical) point of view, material and linguistic strategies for emotional persuasion are only\none part of the rhetorical argumentation, even if an important one. In fact, in the classical and\nholistic account, the means of knowledge are not limited to a purely abstract dimension\n(reason in the Cartesian meaning of the word), because they deal with the totality of human\nbeing: logos (language-thinking), pathos (body and emotions) and ethos (will).\nOther features of rhetorical argumentation are those given by the capabilities of making a\ndiscourse easy to understand (by using linguistic means such as metaphors, examples, figures,\nevocative words or phrases etc.) and rationally approvable (by using commonplaces [topoi]\nwidely shared and/or based on experts\u2019 opinion [memoria], arranged in a certain order\n[dispositio], assisted by empirical evidences [causae] etc.). This phase of argumentation is\nespecially devoted to the creation of effective grounds for legal reasoning: the actors want to\nsuggest to the judge a way of building normative and factual premises, along with a logic\nconnection between them.\nThe last part of rhetorical work is dedicated to the confutation of the opponent\u2019s argument\n(confutatio). This engagement is typically dialectical: the actor must show the audience that\nall (or at least some) of the adversary\u2019s premises are based on unacceptable (or at least less\nacceptable) grounds or that even if they may be acceptable, they are badly connected (and\nconsequently the conclusion is unacceptable). Such conduct could seem extremely conflicting\nand socially dangerous to some scholars of legal sociology, but it is not, because counter-\nargumentation should be regarded from every perspective as a sort of \u201cpublic\nacknowledgement\u201d of the adversary\u2019s full dignity to stand in front of his/her rival as a peer.\nWhat else, in fact, is the counter-arguer going to do, if not treat his/her opponent as real and\neffective, critically analyzing his/her discourse, if only for the purpose of showing how wrong\nit is?\nA logical method for legal reasoning\n305 The dialectical level of legal argumentation is performed in the trial not only by the\ndebating parties but also by the judge, in order to check their premises and conclusions. When\nbalancing the two \u201clegal syllogisms\u201d advanced by the parties, the judge is definitely charged\nwith choosing among a variety of logic elements (standpoints, values, interpretations,\ndescriptions etc.) which cannot remain \u2013 partially or totally \u2013 together.\nIt is at such a stage that the (serious) judge looks at the arguments at stake and\ncontemplates how to build his/her own reasoning. A complex operation which can be\naccomplished in accordance with either, or even partially both, of the parties\u2019 proposals, in a\nway that I am going to consider shortly. At this point in his/her decisional process, the judge\u2019s\nchoice depends on a series of logical moves that I will try to summarize as follows (supposing\nthe judge asking him/herself a progressive set of questions):\n1. plausibility check: to what extent are the standpoints of the parties really\nauthoritative?\nTo establish its standpoint each party has adopted one or more starting points validated\nby common or expert beliefs, based on shared values, arranged in a certain order of\nimportance, assisted by a certain degree of evidence etc. It is clear that points like these\naim at being more than simple opinions (doxai): they aspire to be the most plausible\nones (endoxa) (Cavalla, 1992). So the task of the judge will be to check if in fact they\nare so (are they really shared? by whom? still today? in the way specified by the\narguer? etc.).\n2. coherence check: are the starting points in each party\u2019s discourse logically\nconnected with one another? Is the conclusion of the discourse consistent with its\nstarting points?\n306 It might be the case that the standpoint is predicated upon solid opinions (endoxa), but\nthat these opinions are linked together in a wrong or questionable way, so that the\nconclusion is not correct or at least not the only one possible.\n3. dialectical check: which discourse, compared to the other, is more consistent?\nAs I have noted previously, this argumentative stage is the most complex of all. The\njudge, having previously ascertained the consistency of each party\u2019s argument\n(plausibility and coherence checks), must now compare their force. It is clear that\nevery discourse has been constructed upon constant reciprocal confrontation; every\nopinion has been submitted to the opponent\u2019s objections. The simultaneous presence of\nopposing arguments obliges the judge to ask him/herself a number of questions: how\nmany points in the opposing discourses (S1 vs S2) are authoritative and how\nauthoritative are they? Which of them is more pertinent to the case under discussion?\nAre the conclusions in S1 and S2 clearly connected to their own starting points? Are\nthey coherent with all the starting points or only with some of them? Are there any\ncommon points in S1 and S2? Would it be possible to connect the points in each party\u2019s\nargument in a different way? Would it be possible to connect points arising out of the\ndifferent discourses, S1 and S2? As noted before, at the concluding steps of his/her\nreasoning the judge might choose S1, S2 or even something else: a \u201clegal syllogism\u201d\npartially different from the ones put forward by the parties (e.g. accepting the\nnormative qualification advanced by the prosecutor but not the measure of punishment,\nhaving also accepted some lawyer\u2019s arguments on the seriousness of the crime).\n4. building premises for the \u201clegal syllogism\u201d60: what standpoint is reasonably\nacceptable?\n60 In a previous article (in Italian) I described step #4 as an \u201centhymematic inference\u201d and step #5 as\n\u201c[conclusion of] legal syllogism\u201d (Manzin, 2012c: 74-75). I want to clarify now that since the inference\nconstitutes the final move in legal argumentation, it necessarily implies both the establishment of the premises\n307 At the end of the dialectical check the judge has the precise elements required for the\njustification of (1) and (2). In other words, he/she can build the premises for the unique\n\u201clegal syllogism\u201d authorized by the law, premises that must be clearly indicated in the\nwritten reasoning of the decision, in order to easily allow a further check by higher\nCourts, practical jurists and scholars of jurisprudence. We can properly say that from\nnow onwards the judge is no longer a critical listener to the parties\u2019 discourses and an\nevaluator of their soundness: he/she is becoming now a sort of \u201cthird speaking person\u201d\nhaving his/her own discourse (S3), even if it is built with elements dialectically taken\nfrom S1 and S2. S3 is neither S1 nor S2; compared to them, its content is the following:\n(the syllogism proposed by) S1 is right; or (the syllogism proposed by) S2 is right; or, in\nan intermediary way, something (but not all) is right either in (the syllogism proposed\nby) S1 or S2.\n5. enthymematic inference: given (1) and (2), then\u2026?\nThe last move of legal argumentation links together the premises which have been built\nby the judge in the above mentioned ways: according to one of the parties\u2019 proposals or\nin a particular combination of both. In any case, because it starts from an evaluation (or\nrather a set of evaluations) of the standpoints expressed in S1 and S2, the judge\u2019s\ninference cannot ever be defined as a mere \u201ccopy\u201d of the one or of the other. In\naddition, S3 is performative in nature and such a condition integrates (not replaces!) its\nlogical position. Content of (3) concludes the \u201clegal syllogism\u201d and makes the\njudgment argumentatively forceful, providing a kind of deduction (enthymema) to the\nlegal reasoning.\nHere it is a diagram summarising S3:\nand the drawing of the conclusion, scheduled respectively under #4 and #5. For this reason I prefer to distinguish\nhere the former step of building (1) and (2) from the conclusive one of inferring (3).\n308 Normative (de iure) Descriptive (de facto) Practical/Legal\n\uf022x(Px \u2192 MQx) Pa MQa\nThe judge \u2013 after checks The judge \u2013 after checks The judge\n#1, 2, 3 and 4 \u2013 chooses #1, 2, 3 and 4 \u2013 chooses enthymematically infers a\nthe normative proposals in the descriptive proposals practical conclusion from\nS1 or S2, or partially both in S1 or S2, or partially premises built in #4\nboth\n9. What is legal truth?\nThe conclusion (3) of the legal reasoning \u2013 at the same time argumentative (rhetorical) and\nperformative \u2013 has a status usually defined as \u201clegal truth\u201d. I have tried so far to explain how\nlegal evidence is not only a matter of \u201csubsumption\u201d among supposedly given data (legal\nnorms and facts): the task of the judge is much more complicated, implying interpretation and\nevaluation of arguments. We can say that \u201ca proposition of law is true\u201d (Patterson, 1996) only\nafter determining, by an argumentative analysis of the parties\u2019 discourses opposed in the\ncontroversy, a set of meanings related to the normative and factual statements.\nThe rhetorical (not formal) nature of legal reasoning would seem to have little to do with\nthe concept of truth, whose fundamental connotation should be the one of undeniability. Thus\na proposition of law like (3) should be more exactly described as probable or plausible and\nnot true in the proper sense. Regarding such a question (which of course can be discussed here\nonly very briefly) I believe that two main issues are at stake: (a) what does probable mean and\n(b) what a factual (or historical or material) truth is.\n309 (a) The first issue dates back to the \u201cgreat division\u201d between demonstration and\nargumentation as addressed especially by Cha\u00efm Perelman, according to whom a proposition\nascertained by formal or empirical science is undeniable, whereas argumentation gains only\ndisputable conclusions (Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1958; contra Manzin, 2012a). As I\nhave said before, the field of science is characterized by linguistic and contextual conditions\nwhich are different from the ones in a trial: the former allow conclusions to be inferred that\nare true because they are coherent with the formal or empirical premises of the demonstration\n(which have been conventionally established before the logical operation of deduction or\ninduction and never put in doubt during the operation itself). Legal argumentation, on the\ncontrary, works with language that is vague and constantly under question. For this reason\nPerelman argued that argumentative conclusions were probable and not certain, maintaining\nthat a demonstration, proceeding from undisputed premises, finishes with an indisputable\nconclusion, while an argumentation, proceeding from disputable premises, ends with a\ndisputable conclusion. Basically, Perelman believed that the conclusion of a syllogism had the\nsame status as its premises: true, probable, wrong, etc. But let us consider the conclusions of a\nsyllogism such as all men are mortal, Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal. Is it a\ndemonstration or an argumentation? According to Perelman and many others, it depends on\nthe nature of the premises. In medical sciences, for instance, the mortality of all human beings\nis established from the outset and no longer in dispute, so the syllogism would be right. But in\nhuman sciences the mortality of a man/woman can be related to the memory of his/her\nbehavior, depending on the agreement about it; in this case the syllogism could be wrong if,\nfor instance, Socrates was thought to be immortal as a philosopher since his thinking is still\nalive.\nIn conclusion: certainty on one side (that of formal and empirical science), plausibility on\nthe other (that of the humanities) \u2013 \u201cthe two cultures\u201d of modern Western thought (Snow,\n310 1959). But is it really so? From the logical point of view, the syllogism in my example is\nalways valid if the conclusion is coherent to its premises. By this I mean, if you have accepted\na certain definition of \u201cmortality\u201d, \u201cSocrates\u201d, \u201cman\u201d etc., and as far as such definitions are\nnot disputed, then the conclusion itself, if correctly inferred (in this case by modus ponens),\ncannot be refuted because it simply has no incontrovertible alternatives. In other terms, it is\ntrue. Truth is therefore a matter of the impossibility of contradiction, regardless of the nature\nof the premises (either formalised or unformalised), and a proposition of law is true insofar as\nno reasonable argument can deny the selected topoi and the logical connection between them\n(Manzin, 2011, 2012c).\n(b) The second issue has metaphysical implications, dealing with the question of \u201cBeing\nand time\u201d. According to an underlying Cartesianism, scholars of legal sciences and practical\njurists often distinguish a so-called factual (or historical or material) truth from the legal one\nobtained at the end of the trial. Some of them skeptically maintain that the former is\ninaccessible; some others consider the latter as a sort of gradual approach to \u201cwhat really\nhappened\u201d61. This kind of legal pessimism/optimism, broadly diffused among lawyers, judges\nand simple citizens, implicitly or explicitly presumes that a factual truth does exist\n\u201csomewhere\u201d in unchangeable conditions (like A=A) and that the purpose of the trial is to (try\nto) describe A using the means given by law and human knowledge. No doubt that the\npurpose of the judgment is to furnish normative descriptions of \u201csomething\u201d like A, but such\n\u201csomething\u201d, since it happened in the past, never properly exists within the space-time context\nof the judgment. In other words, A remains always and only hypothetical, because no further\nperspective points are provided in a space-and-time-free condition to verify the\ncorrespondence A=A. Then, when we talk of \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d, such a definition should be\ncorrectly related to the description of the event under judgment, not to the event itself, which\n61 For a critical comparison between realistic and anti-realistic accounts on legal truth, see Patterson (1996).\n311 is inconceivable outside our knowledge of it in a different space-time. Indeed, what \u201ctruth\u201d\ncould a fact in itself have? The one deriving from a sort of self-evidence? \u2013 If so, our\nreasoning should suffer a fallacious regressus ad infinitum. Is it then a sort of transcendental\nstatus? \u2013 We could affirm that only by accepting some prescriptive assertions: a matter of will,\nin such case, not of reason. Finally, is it the result of an empirical proof? \u2013 Contemporary\nphysics recognises very well that empirical observations always modify the object of the\nexperiment.\nIn conclusion: there is no \u201cfactual\u201d or \u201chistorical\u201d or \u201cmaterial\u201d truth which we can talk\nabout at the end of the trial (and, I would guess, everywhere) but the truth of rhetorical\narguments built around some normative and factual hypothesis, in a way and to the extent that\nsuch arguments were coherent and, thus, undeniable.\nWhy legal truths are truths\nThe above-mentioned \u201clegal pessimists/optimists\u201d could presume at this point of my article\nthat argumentative (rhetorical) truth is actually a very weak one, depending on the consistency\nof standpoints whose places and connections can be put in doubt at any time. I might agree\nwith them, but my question is: what, then, is a strong(er) truth? If it were demonstrable, as in\nPerelman\u2019s opinion, it should be a truth granted by the coherence between formal or empirical\npremises and the conclusion. From this point of view, the only difference between\ndemonstration and argumentation should be the one regarding the nature of scientific\nmonologue, which is conventional and linguistically artificial, compared to the nature of\nargumentative dialogue, which is unconventional and linguistically vague, but no other\ndifference could be found. Both demonstrative and rhetorical truths are truth because and to\nthe extent that they are undeniable (i.e. a logical alternative does not exist). If you have\naccepted their premises and if the inference is correct, you can never deny their conclusion\n312 without being contradicted. When ruled by coherence, rhetorical argumentation is definitely\nnot a \u201cweaker\u201d kind of reasoning than scientific demonstration, but only a type which is\nespecially suited to unformalised and controversial contexts.\nOf course, in scientific demonstration (monological) truth remains undisputed as long as\nconvention is maintained, while in rhetorical argumentation (dialogical) it must be defended\nevery time it is attacked by the interlocutors. But such a difference has nothing to do with the\nstrength of the truth\u2013 it has to do, if anything, with its duration. In abstract and very general\ncontexts (such as for instance, in mathematics) premises and methods usually last a long time\nbefore meeting criticism; in concrete and particular ones (such as for instance, in public\ncontexts like law or politics) it is not unusual to encounter objections at every step. So what\nfollows? Do we really think (as Montesquieu and Beccaria did) that the absolute reduction of\nconcrete to abstract \u2013 of practice to theory \u2013 would be the best way of reasoning in law? I\nbelieve that history itself has already reached a judgment about that.\n11. Some conclusions\nHaving offered (although very briefly) a short account of argumentative logic and legal\ntruth62, I shall try now to answer the questions I posed at the beginning of my article. My\nessential aim was to point out how logic could help the (serious) judge decide on the case,\nknowing that his/her commitment to logical consistency is also provided for under statute law\n(see in Italy arts. 360.1.5 CPC and 606.1.e CPP).\nI would like to emphasize once again that if logic can help legal decisions (avoiding the\nreduction of trial to a mere act of legitimate power) it can do so only by building and\nconnecting the argumentative premises in iure et in facto, not by formalizing the legal\n62 For an accurate survey of theories on legal argumentation, see Feteris (1999).\n313 reasoning into a \u201csubsumption\u201d. Hence logic in law implies, from the judge\u2019s perspective, a\nprocess of selection from the parties\u2019 discourses and a final multiple checks in the sense\nclarified by the diagram at the end of Section 8.\nPoints in opposite arguments S1 or S2 will be discarded when incoherent in themselves or\nbetween each other, either because referents framing the interpretation are changed or for\nconnections are wrongly made. Let us consider the following diagram:\nS1 or S2 Premise (1) Premise (2) Conclusion (3) Qualification\nReferent R means a means b S possible\nReferent R\u2019 means c means d \u2260S possible\nRonnection \uf022x(Px \u2192MQx) Pa MQa correct\nConnection \uf022x(Px \u2192MQx) Pd MQa incorrect\nConclusions of arguments could be =S or \u2260S, depending on the proposed interpretative\nframing (referent R or R\u2019); it could happen, however, that premises in the same argument\nwere intended at a certain point of the reasoning as \u201ca\u201d (under referent R) and at another point\nas \u201cc\u201d (under referent R\u2019), leading to an incorrect conclusion. In fact, once having accepted\npremises (1) and (2) in some sense (\u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d or \u201cc\u201d and \u201cd\u201d), the inference is compulsory:\n=S in the former case, \u2260S in the latter. For the same reason, if premise (1) is constructed under\nreferent R (and means \u201ca\u201d), you cannot connect it to a premise (2) meaning \u201cd\u201d (referent\nR\u2019\u2260R): in such case too conclusion MQa would be logically incorrect \u2013 and lawfully invalid.\nAs can be seen, most of this procedure is governed by the rule of non-contradiction,\nexpressly mentioned in art. 360.1.5 CPC (\u201ccontradictory argument\u201d as a motivation for the\ninvalidity of a judgment). But its complexity also makes it clear that legal reasoning might be\n\u201cclearly illogical\u201d (as stated in art. 606.1. e CPP) not only when simply \u201ccontradictory\u201d: for\n314 example, we could have a conclusion inferred from incomplete premises (i.e. where some\nplaces are lacking). See the following,\nif (b, c, d) then (1); if (1) and (2), then (3)\nnow (b, c) then (1); if (1) and (2), then (3); now (3) = incorrect\nIn this case, the argument is not \u201clacking\u201d in the strict sense of the word (as maintained by\nboth the cited arts. in CPC and CPP) but, more exactly, \u201cinsufficient\u201d (as in 360.1.5 CPC).\nIn conclusion, I hope that these few guidelines on legal argumentation \u2013 inspired by, but not\nlimited to, the statements set out in the Italian codes of Civil and Criminal procedure \u2013 could\nhelp (serious) judges in their justification in cases63. At the same time, I assume that a clear\ncognition of rhetoric in legal reasoning could enable (serious) lawyers to argue in a more\neffective way in trials, that is to say, in a way that is more persuasive for the audience and\nmore logically suitable for the judge.\nReferences\nAarnio, A.

EDUCATION\n320 Debate as an Educational Tool: Is Polarization a Debate side effect?\nManuele De Conti, University of Padua\nSummary\nCompetitive debate is a challenging educational tool for argumentation. As the empirical research\nproves, debating improves learning, critical thinking and verbal and non-verbal communication skills, among\nothers. Nonetheless, many scholars criticize it for one of its alleged and detrimental impacts: polarization. Indeed,\nlistening to them, polarization would lead to bias assimilation, close-mindedness, dichotomization and\ndisagreement and conflict escalating attitudes, polarization would appear as a debate \u201cside effect\u201d and debate\nitself as a detrimental educational tool. Therefore, the purposes of this survey will be (i) to show that polarization\nis neither a necessary nor a likely consequence of debating, (ii) to argue that even when polarization occurs bias\nassimilation, close-mindedness, dichotomization and disagreement and conflict escalating attitudes, do not\nnecessarily follow, and (iii) to stress the mistakes these detractors commit. Finally, polarization will lose its \u201cside\neffect\u201d color and debating will be recognized as an effective and organic tool for argumentation education.\nKeywords: competitive debate, polarization, argumentation education\n1. Debate and competitive debate: framework and definition\nDebate is a particular type of dialogue. Theoretically, dialogue means a process of\ncommunication between at least two people that occurs through a series of back and forth\nmessages also considered as organized steps toward fulfilling a goal (Walton, 1992, 1998,\n2006). A dialogue is genuinely communicative: the units of dialogue are primarily speech acts,\nand these communicative acts are sent out by participants in reply to other messages (Walton,\n1992). Therefore, a dialogue can be more straightforwardly defined as a sequence of\nexchanges of messages or speech acts between two (or more) participants (Walton, 1998,\n2006, 2008; cf. Fuentes & Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez, 2011). The most elementary illustration of a dialogue is\nwhen one party asks another party a question (Walton, 2007).\n321 Rules and goals are other important components of dialogue. Rules define the types of\nmessages allowed at each move, the turn taking, and what counts as a successful sequence of\nmessages in fulfilling the goal. The goal in contrast is the final state toward which the\nsequence of moves progresses. There are two types of goals: collective and individual. A\ncollective goal refers to the goal pursued by a particular type of dialogue. Some examples of\ncollective goals are the following: to resolve a difference of opinion, to reach an informed\nbasis for action, to reveal a deeper conflict, or to transfer knowledge. Individual goals, on the\nother hand, are the goals individuals pursue in order to realize the collective goal of the type\nof dialogue they are engaged in. Some examples of individual goals are to persuade one party\nof the correctness of a particular proposition, to obtain or give advice on a problem, to\nverbally strike at and humiliate an opponent, or to obtain information (Walton, 1992, 2006).\nSeveral identifiable types of dialogue exist based on this framework. A pedagogical\ntype of dialogue stems from an initial situation where one party is ignorant and involves the\ncollective goal of transferring knowledge. Diversely, negotiation occurs in the context of a\nconflict of interest with settlement as the collective goal. Lastly, persuasion dialogue or\ncritical discussion emerges from a difference of opinion with the aim of resolving the\ndisagreement as a collective goal (Walton, 1992, 1996).\nDebate is a type of dialogue, too. Its context is adversarial, and both parties aim to\npersuade a third party, i.e., the audience or the judge, by making the strongest argument for\ntheir side. In addition, debate is strictly regulated by rules of procedure that determine when\nand how long each arguer may speak. When the debate ends, the audience, either one or more\njudges or another type of referee, determine by voting which side had the better argument\n(Snider, 2008; Walton, 2008).\nSome scholars do not recognize these debate rules, also called debate format, to be the\nmain features of this type of dialogue because a real debate means advancing, disputing and\n322 defending arguments relevant to the issue debated (Branham, 1991: 22). However, in this\npaper we consider both rules and advancing, disputing and defending arguments relevantly to\nthe issue debated, the main features of the debate and elements of the definition of debate\nitself. Indeed, if we do not consider rules as a fundamental aspect of debate, debate would not\ndiffer from other types of dialogue. Furthermore, if we do not consider arguing relevantly to\nthe issue as a fundamental aspect of debate, debate could be confused with the eristic dialogue\nas some scholars seems to do (Cf. Walton, 1992): when debaters, as well discussion partners,\nturn eristic, they violate the norm of the model, letting the interaction deteriorate in a different\nkind of exchange (J\u00f8rgensen, 1998: 439).\nTherefore, in this paper, debate will be considered a strictly ruled type of competitive\n(Wood and Goodnight, 1994) dialogue where opposing parties try to win their opponents, by\npersuading the audience, the judges or the referees, i.e. the decision makers, through\nadvancing, disputing and defending arguments relevant to the issue being debated (Branham,\n1991: 22). The benefits of debate as a type of dialogue are, among others, to enable parties to\nmake wise decisions (Ehninger and Brockriede, 1978), to facilitate spreading of information\n(Walton, 1992), to test different points of view (Brimble and Pritchard, 2003) and to\ndetermine how changes should occur (Snider, 2008).\nFollowing this framework, the so-called academic debate (Freely, 1961), competitive\ndebate (Hensley & Carlin, 1994), and classroom debate (Snider & Schnurer, 2002), among\nother designations (from now on, all known as competitive debate), differ from the general\ndefinition of debate. Unlike forensic, public, political, or parliamentary debate, competitive\ndebate is rigorously conducted under the direction of an educational institution for the purpose\nof providing educational opportunities for its students (Freely, 1961).\n1.1 Debate\u2019s positive impacts\n323 Many positive impacts of competitive debate exist for students. For our purposes, we\nwill focus just on three of them: learning (Combs and Bourne, 1994; Scott, 2008; Vo &\nMorris, 1996), critical thinking and argumentation (Allen et al., 1999; Colbert, 1995; Korcok,\n1997), and verbal and non-verbal communication (Inoue & Nakano, 2004).\nSchool or academic debate occurs on controversial issues. Performing research to find\nmaterial to advocate pro or contra positions facilitates the ability to understand issues, as\nshown by the five-year study of Combs and Bourne (1994). According to their survey,\nstudents participating in their business administration courses considered competitive debate a\nbetter learning tool than standard lectures. Of those students, 88.9% declared competitive\ndebate better than standard lectures for gaining an understanding of the various positions on\nissues, and furthermore, 77.5% of them thought that they learned more than if they had\nattended a normal class. These results were corroborated by Han Vo and Richard Morris\u2019s\nsurvey (1996). Three out of four students in Vo and Morris\u2019s economy course considered\ndebate helpful in understanding the course material and in developing a more realistic idea of\nthe economy. In addition, the same outcome was recently reported by Sophia Scott for a\nScience, Technology and Society course (2008).\nDebating as a method for learning has been adopted in many disciplines, including\neconomics (Vo & Morris, 1996), business administration (Combs & Bourne, 1994),\npsychology (Moeller, 1985; O'Kon & Sutz, 2005), sociology (Scott, 2008), philosophy\n(Nicolli & Cattani, 2008), geography (Estaville, 2001), chemistry (Streitberger, 1988),\nstatistics (Shatz, 1985), and nutrition (Magnus, 2000), only to mention a few. However, few\nof the research studies mentioned involved statistical analysis, and even for those that did\n(Combs & Bourne, 1994; Scott, 2008; Vo & Morris, 1996), the investigation was limited to\nstudents\u2019 perceptions. In conclusion, without doubting these outcomes, it seems appropriate to\nask whether the data needs to be confirmed through other evidence and research methods.\n324 Indeed, multiple choice testing, which was used in the survey of Green and Klug (1990), and\nmixed methods research, like that conducted by Duffin (2006), led to the conclusion that\nclassrooms that make heavy use of debate have greater improvement with respect to students\u2019\nunderstanding of the material than other classes, as well as the conclusion that competitive\ndebate itself, adopted directly as an assessment tool in schools, might help the scientific\ncommunity to strengthen its results.\nCritical thinking and argumentation skills are the other benefits of debate that are often\nstressed. Semlak and Shields (1977), using judges\u2019 reports, revealed how students with debate\ntraining had significantly higher scores in analysis than students with only public speaking\ntraining. Furthermore, Colbert (1995), in considering the objections of Hill (1993) and\nindirectly those of Greenstreet (1993), proved with a meta-analysis that debaters score better\nthan non-debaters in critical thinking. In addition, Colbert argued that the Watson-Glaser\nCritical Thinking Appraisal (WGCTA), the questionnaire adopted by the surveys he reviewed,\nwas one of the best tools developed thus far for critical thinking, in spite of its flaws (Ennis,\n1958, 2009). In conclusion, Colbert, as Korcok did (1997), tried to promote cooperation\namong scholars for methodologically more valid surveys.\nImprovements in critical thinking and argumentation skills were also confirmed by\nanother exhaustive meta-analysis. After having reviewed 17 empirical research studies on\ncommunication, Allen et al. (1999) concluded that \u201cregardless of the specific measure used to\nassess critical thinking, the type of design employed, or the specific type of communication\nskills training taught, critical thinking improved as a result of training in communication skills.\n[\u2026] Participation in forensic demonstrated the largest improvement in critical thinking score\nwhether considering longitudinal or cross-sectional designs\u201d (ibidem: 27).\nRecently, an Italian pre- and post- text analysis study has been done (Turchi, et. al.,\n2008) and critical thinking improvement has continued to be investigated, even if considering\n325 the perception only of both teachers (Cf. Martens, 2007) and students (Scott, 2008), and in\naddition, critical thinking in the classroom setting is still actively promoted (Oros, 2007).\nNonetheless, more empirical surveys on the relationship between debate and critical thinking\nare necessary to transcend the meta-analyses conducted by Colbert (1995), Korcok (1997),\nand Allen et al. (1999) (Cf. Bellon, 2000; Broda-Bahm, 2002).\nIn conclusion, improvement of verbal and non-verbal communication is the last impact\nof debate on students we consider in this brief review. The study of Semlak and Shields\n(1977), previously presented, explains the situation best: not only do debaters score better in\nanalysis, but also they perform better than public speaking students in organization and\ncommunication of the message. Furthermore, according to the research by Williams, McGee,\nand Worth (2001), as well as by Littlefield (2001), students perceive the improved ability to\nspeak and communicate as the most common benefit of debate. This same outcome also\nemerged from a broader survey (Inoue & Nakano, 2004) that provided an intercultural point\nof view.\n2. Polarization as a debate \u201cside effect\u201d\nAmong the several debate impacts on students some are considered highly negative.\nPolarization is one of them. Polarization means moving in the direction of the initial tendency\nor attitude (Petty and Wegener, 1998) strengthening the original position (Sears et al., 1964)\nor becoming more entrenched in it (Lord et al., 1979). Polarization seems to be linked to bias\nassimilation or confirmation bias (ibid.), i.e. the inclination to give weight only to evidence\nthat is consistent with the hypothesis in question (Risen and Gilovich, 2007), and seems due\nto the cognitive engagement with the topic (Lao and Kuhn, 1996). Indeed, polarization may\noccur when a party believes in a particular opinion (Lao and Kuhn, 1996; Pomerantz et al.,\n1995; Raden, 1985), when this opinion is strongly advocated for or its advocacy is listened to\n326 (Budesheim and Lundquist, 1999; Lao and Kuhn, 1996; Sears et al., 1964), and with aging\n(Kuhn et al., 1997).\nPolarization mostly occurs in the debate setting. Sears et al. (1964) recognized that the\ndebate audience\u2019s confidence in previous opinions was strengthened after having watched a\ndebate. Lao and Kuhn (1996) and Budesheim and Lundquist (1999) showed that debaters also\npolarize, and our exploratory survey on 63 debaters confirmed this result. The exception was\nwhen debaters advocated for a position opposite to their personal belief, in which case their\nconfidence in their opinion weakened significantly (De Conti, in press; cf. Budesheim &\nLundquist, 1999; Green & Klug, 1990).\nThe trouble with polarization is that it seems to trigger bias assimilation or\nconfirmation bias (Lord et al., 1979; Nickerson, 1998; Sears et al., 1964), dichotomization \u2014\ni.e. \u201cradicalizing a polarity by emphasizing the incompatibility of the poles and the\ninexistence of intermediate alternatives by stressing the obvious character of the dichotomy as\nwell as of the pole that ought to be preferred\u201d (Dascal, 2008: 34; cf. Dascal and Knoll, 2011)\n\u2014 and escalate conflict and disagreement attitudes, as Glasl (1997), Pruitt and Kim (2004)\nand Kennedy and Pronin (2008) attest.\nThese negative outcomes help us to make explicit the reasoning behind many scholars\nwho discard debate. If debate leads to polarization and polarization leads to bias assimilation,\ndichotomization or disagreement and conflict escalating attitudes, then debate is a detrimental\neducational tool. Johnson and Johnson (1994) consider debate as a context where\n\u201ccompetitors tend to avoid communicating with each other, misperceive each other\u2019s position\nand motivations, be suspicious of each other, deny the legitimacy of others\u2019 needs and\nfeelings, and see the situation only from their own perspective\u201d (ibidem: 118) concluding that\ndebate promotes closed-mindedness or refusing to incorporate any opponent\u2019s arguments into\none\u2019s own position as Felton et al. (2009) point out. In addition, Tannen (1999) argues that\n327 since debaters \u201cwant to win the argument [\u2026] they must go for the most gross and dramatic\nstatements they can muster. They will not concede an opponent\u2019s point, even if they can see\nits validity because that would weaken their position\u201d (ibidem: 261). Furthermore, Westbrook\n(2002) although he conceded that some debaters in nineteenth-century colleges and debate\nsocieties could have reexamined their position on dominant values, concluded that debating\ndid not influence debaters to resist hegemonic ideologies because they were arguing for\nvictory, instead of inquiring for the truth.\nIn addition, Andrews (1995) considered the Hegelian dialectic structuring the debate\nas a simplification for the mind and of the mind and Tumposky (2004) argued that \u201cDebate\ncan oversimplify and misrepresent the nature of knowledge. By setting up issues as\ndichotomies, debate reinforces a Western bias toward dualism and ignores the multiplicity of\nperspectives inherent in many issues\u201d (ibidem: 53-54). Moreover, Barnard (1937) considered\ndebate as developing in an over-aggressive and combative manner that results in a bellicose\nattitude, and again, Tannen sees debate as agonistic in nature where agonism means \u201can\nautomatic warlike stance\u201d and \u201cagonistic response\u201d means \u201ca kind of programmed\ncontentiousness \u2013 a prepatterned, unthinking use of fighting to accomplish goals that do not\nnecessarily require it\u201d (Tannen, 1999: 10). Therefore, these conclusions, influenced these\nscholars to consider debate an unsuitable tool for education in a multilingual, multicultural,\nand economically diverse society (ibid.), as Hyde and Bineham (2000) also argue.\nAll these features played a significant role in making competitive debate appear like a\ndisdained tool belonging to the so often rejected and considered harmful adversary paradigm\n(Cf. Menkel-Meadow, 1996; Moulton, 1983; Tannen, 1999, 2002).\n3. Is polarization a \u201cside effect\u201d?\n328 The purpose of this paper is not to rebut the arguments against the adversary paradigm,\nwhich has been done by some scholars already, who effectively argued in favor of the\nadversary paradigm with a special focus on competitive debate (Cattani 2005; Foster, 2004).\nWe simply wish to say that substituting debating with role playing so as to avoid antagonism,\nfor example, will lead to too much focus on perspective taking at the expense of\nargumentation and its associated benefits.\nIndeed, Mitchell (2000) himself, after praising role-playing over debating, recognized\nthat \u201csince arguments advanced in role-play simulations involve highly subjective identity\ninterpretations, it would be difficult indeed for teachers to develop evalutative criteria that\nwould judge radically different student performances fairly\u201d (ibidem: 136). Otherwise, debate\n\u201cadversaries present arguments in the voice of omniscient commentators, delivering [an]\noverarching assessment of issues that \u2018clash\u2019 directly with positions staked out by opponents\u201d\n(ibidem: 148).\nIn addition, even if not directly, psychological and educational science research\nsupports the benefits of the adversary paradigm too. For example, Sears (1966) proved that in\na mock trial setting subjects familiar with neither side\u2019s arguments seek a nonpartisan two-\nsided presentation. Although this choice was made as an economical way of comparing the\nvirtues of the two alternatives and arriving at a reasonable preference, it was preferred over\none-sided partisan argument. Furthermore, Turner et al., (2010) showed that people seek out\ncounter-attitudinal information mostly when they are confident in their arguments and\nforewarned to interact with someone with opposite views. Therefore, on the contrary, the\npurpose of this paper is to show that polarization is not a debate \u201cside effect\u201d, to reject the\nreasoning concluding that debate is a detrimental tool because it leads to polarization.\nNonetheless, it is of the most importance to stress that debating is neither necessarily\nnor likely to lead to polarization. As previously seen, when debaters advocate for an opposite\n329 position than their personal beliefs, the confidence in such opinions weakens significantly (De\nConti, in press; cf. Budesheim and Lundquist, 1999; Green and Klug, 1990). This means that\ndebaters de-polarize, implying that they move in the opposite direction rather than the initial\nview or attitude (Petty and Wegener, 1998). Therefore, after considering the above arguments\nit can be concluded that some debaters polarize. However this is neither necessary nor likely\nin a long period. Many debate formats, such as the Lincoln-Douglas and more generally all\nSwitch-Side Debates require students to debate several times, both for and against, about the\nsame issue (Lewis and Wiese, 2000; Muir, 1993). In such instances, a tendency to moderate\nradicalization occurs because people have to support positions opposite to their opinion\n(Huckfeldt et al., 2004). Moreover, it is always possible to adopt procedures specifically\ndeveloped to prevent polarization. For example, the 5\u2019R model (Williams, 2010) suggests\nReading research articles representing different points of view on each issue, Rapping the\narticles with the debate group and with the instructor, wRiting an essay on the core\ndisagreement across the two opposing arguments recognizing bias and persuasive strategies\nand evaluating the empirical merit of the data, Reporting or having a debate and finally,\nRepeating or having another debate on the same motion, some months later. In conclusion, as\nWilliam proved, the 5\u2019R model helped nearly 33% of the students to change their attitude, a\ngreater outcome than that documented by other studies on debate (ibidem; cf. Landrum, 1991).\nTherefore, after having reviewed some research it can be concluded that debating is neither\nnecessarily nor likely to leads to polarization.\nThe question arises whether, whenever polarization occurs, it is necessary that bias\nassimilation, close-mindedness, dichotomization and disagreement, and conflict escalating\nattitudes will follow. The answer to this question is negative: it is not necessary.\n3.1. Against bias assimilation as a debating consequence\n330 Walton (1992) and Blair (1988) argue that not all bias is harmful; there is nothing\ninherently wrong about partisan argumentation \u201cwhich takes up only one side of an issue in\ncontentious dialogue with an opposed advocate of a differing point of view\u201d (Walton, 1992:\n155). Indeed, having a position on an issue is different from having a censurable bias which\nmeans that the argument is never really open to the risk of loss. Censurable bias or \u201cbad\u201d bias,\ni.e. bias that is open to criticism (Blair, 1988), is a fault called hardened bias (Walton, 1992:\n157). Therefore, advocating a position does not necessarily mean being biased in a harmful\nway. Even more relevant to this point is that, as Nickerson (1998) argues, there is a huge\ndifference in building a case deliberately and consciously instead of engaging in case-building\nwithout being aware of doing so. The first type of case-building is illustrated by what\nattorneys and debaters do, namely to confirm a particular position. Otherwise, the second type\nof case-building is a less explicit and a less conscious process. This is what psychologists\nrefer to as the confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998: 175-176). What seems really important for\neducation is that the difference between case-building and evidence-weighing must be explicit\n(Narveson, 1980).\nAccordingly, even dogmatism if moderate can play an important role and not to be\nconsidered harmful. Popper himself regarded a little dogmatism, even a little obstinacy, to be\nuseful in avoiding the premature rejection of a hypothesis (Popper, 1972): \u201ca degree of\nconservatism plays a stabilizing role in science and guards the field against uncritical\nacceptance of so-called discoveries that fail to stand the test of time\u201d (Nickerson, 1998: 207).\nFor this reason and in the light of the rules (Wood and Goodnight, 1994) and game (Snider,\n1983, 1984) features of competitive debate, that require for actively and consciously building\na case (Nickerson, 1998), and in the light of the previous empirical research that attests to the\nimprovements of debaters in critical thinking skills (Allen et al., 1999; Colbert, 1995, Korcok,\n331 1997) for example, leading students to avoid fallacies because judges can penalize them, it\ncould be concluded that debate does not necessarily lead to hardened bias or confirmation bias.\nMoreover, debate does not necessarily lead to hardened bias or confirmation bias\nbecause the debate format can be adapted to avoid such consequences. Fuentes and\nSantib\u00e1\u00f1ez (2011) strongly suggest adding a third team in the debate match, so as to facilitate\nunderstanding between adversaries. Quite often competitors do not refer to what the\nopponents established as a reason for their point of view. Consequently, a third team\nappointed to introduce into the debate the omitted information or the motion\u2019s core arguments,\ncan help mitigating bias assimilation and off topic debates.\n3.2. Rejecting close-mindedness as debating outcomes\nClose-mindedness and dichotomization do not necessarily result from debating.\nAuthorities argued that considering the issues regardless of prejudices (Alden, 1900) and\ndeveloping the attitude to examine and compare opinions before reaching a reasoned decision\n(Branham, 1991) are attributed to debate practice and the elements of open-mindedness,\nnamely being receptive to new and different ideas (Johnson and Johnson, 2000). These\nbenefits suggest that debate is an effective tool in preparing for a more thorough evaluation of\nthe different points of view and their reasons. Even the philosophers, such as John Stuart Mill\n(1992) and Karl Popper (1962), recognized these benefits of debate practice; although, they\nwere referring to less formalized debates than competitive ones. As we have already hinted,\nthese benefits are also supported by previously presented empirical results as, for example\nlearning and understanding issues (Duffin, 2006; Scott, 2008). Furthermore, competitive\ndebate promotes understanding of counter-attitudinal points of view. Tjosvold and Johnson\n(1977) and Tjosvold et al. (1980) assert that the presence of controversy promotes a greater\nunderstanding of another person\u2019s cognitive perspective than when it is not present, and\n332 Bonomo et al. (2010) claim that debate promotes tolerancia critica, namely acceptance of\nothers without devaluing one\u2019s own ideas and convictions. This last outcome was empirically\nproved by Rogers and Rennels (in press) in a 13-year-longitudinal survey. In their research\nRogers and Rennels conclude that \u201cdebaters were significantly more likely to display\nunderstanding and cultural tolerance than those who were not trained in competitive debate\u201d.\nAs an ultimate proof, Lord, Lepper and Preston (1984), after having taken into account the\nless than optimal evaluation of counter-attitudinal evidence, by people who hold strong\nopinions (Lord, et al., 1979), showed that either direct instruction or indirectly making\nopposing possibilities more salient actions that could be taken by coaches themselves,\npromotes impartiality (ibidem: 1239). Hence, close-mindedness does not necessary result\nfrom debate practice.\n3.3. Discounting dichotomization as a debating impact\nThe outcomes previously mentioned favor the case against dichotomization too. De-\ndichotomization means \u201cshowing that the opposition between the poles can be constructed as\nless logically binding than a contradiction, thus allowing for intermediate alternatives;\nactually developing or exemplifying such alternatives\u201d (Dascal, 2008: 35). Therefore, if\ncompetitive debate is considered also as a game (Snider, 1983, 1984) and not the way in\nwhich people should relate with one another all the time, and, as we noticed before,\ncompetitive debate leads to understanding issues and people significantly deeper (Combs and\nBourne, 1994; Duffin, 2006; Rogers and Rennels, in press; Scott, 2008; Vo and Morris, 1996),\nde-dichotomization, rather dichotomization, is more likely to occur.\nIn addition, de-dichotomization is not only pointed out by reasoning and surveys. It\ncan be also attained by specific guidelines. For example, multisided debates were born due to\nthe realization that some issues are not clearly black and white. Indeed, most debate motions\n333 can be answered by a spectrum of answers (Snider and Schnurer, 2002). To clarify how this\nkind of debate works:\nConsider a debate about what the United Nations stance should be concerning the\nnation of Iraq. One side of the debate might represent a hard-line stance that advocated\nstrict sanctions and a vigorous bombing campaign to get the Iraqi people to rebel\nagainst Saddam Hussein. A second side might advocate humanitarian assistance to\nhelp rebuild the shattered infrastructure of Iraq and feed starving children. Yet, a third\nposition might represent a decided \u201chands-off\u201d approach, arguing that the best thing\nthat the UN could do would be to leave Iraq alone (Snider and Schnurer, 2002: 75).\nAnother example could be choosing a motion such as \u201cWho has the most pride (or prejudice)\nin Austen\u2019s novel?\u201d rather than \u201cElizabeth Bennett has more pride (or prejudice) than Darcy\nin Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice\u201d. Rephrasing the motion following this suggestion will\nsplit up the classroom into more groups allowing a multisided debate (Mareli, 2011).\nFurthermore, it is always possible to refrain from choosing and rewarding a \u201cwinning\u201d\nteam by leaving the debate open to structural alteration, such as open dialogue or to adopt\ndebate formats that allow direct questioning among debaters, as the cross examination format\nallows. Undoubtedly, these debate formats can allow students to perceive, address and work\nwith the contingency and relativity of their arguments (Mareli, 2011) avoiding\ndichotomization.\n3.4. Dismissing disagreement and conflict escalating attitudes as necessary debating results\nThe cases against bias assimilation, close-mindedness and dichotomization lead us\ndirectly to our last point; escalating disagreement and conflict attitudes. To escalate means to\nincrease rapidly or to make something more intense and serious; although, sometimes, this\ncan be interpreted as using heavier tactics than before or putting more pressure on the\n334 participants (Pruitt and Kim, 2004). As Glasl (1982; 1997) declares, debate and polemic\ninvolve polarization in thinking, feelings and will, and they lead to the use of verbal violence\nand gain recognition by speaking to an audience, namely addressing a third party rather than\nthe other party. Indeed, Kennedy and Pronin (2008) proved that the more we disagree with\nsomeone the more we tend to have the perception that those who disagree with us are biased.\nThis undesirable outcome has, among its consequences, become more and more aggressive.\nHowever, competing activities are not necessarily linked to aggressiveness. As Pruitt\nand Kim (2004) pointed out, competing activities sometimes inhibit aggression. Moderate\nheat could provoke aggression, but severe heat could result in flight, if the situation allows it.\nSimilarly, the best way to stop angry children from crying is to divert their attention to a\npleasurable competing activity. Nonetheless, and most importantly, it is always possible to\navoid using verbal aggression or not to allow the conflict to escalate to a more dangerous\nbehavior.\nGlasl gives some tested suggestions on avoiding harsh debate or conflict escalation,\nwhich are: concentrating on the disputed core issues, avoiding violence in communication,\nrecognizing unfair debating tactics. Hence, as it clearly appears, these suggestions require\nfundamental skills in debating, as every complete debate book proves (Huber and Snider,\n2005; Trapp et al., 2005; Wood and Goodnight, 1994). Moreover, Kennedy and Pronin (2008)\nargue that increasing efforts to achieve an accurate understanding of the world is a promising\nintervention to avoid disagreement and conflict escalation. But again, this is exactly what\ndebate and debate preparation lead to, as the surveys on learning attest.\nIn conclusion, Infante et al. (1984) showed that argumentative people are less\naggressive than non-argumentative ones. Swift and Vourvoulias (2006) also pointed out that\nargumentative people have more satisfying relationships and Mezuk (2009) proved that\nAfrican American male high school debaters were 70% more likely to graduate and three\n335 times less likely to drop out of high school than those who did not participate in debates. Such\nan outcome implies that, since competitive debate leads to a diminishing school drop out rate,\nit diminishes criminal behavior because dropouts are more likely to engage in criminal\nactivities than students and educated people (Blomberg et al., 2012; Kimberly et al. 2012;\nMoretti, 2005).\nAs a result, from what has been argued so far, it is only reasonable to conclude that\nbias assimilation, close-mindedness, dichotomization and conflict or disagreement escalating\nattitudes do not necessarily result from debate and polarization. Therefore, polarization is not\na necessary \u201cside effect\u201d of debate even if some of the negative consequences mentioned so\nfar are likely to occur in some debaters when training or judging are inadequate (Cox and\nAdam, 1993; Ehninger, 1952; Friedley, 1983; Hinck, 2003; Stepp, 1990; Thomas and Hart,\n1983; Wood and Rowland-Morin, 1989).\n4. Detractors mistakes\nAs previously shown, polarization is neither a necessary nor a likely consequence of\ncompetitive debating even if it sometimes occurs among debaters. Nonetheless, we have also\nseen that, even if polarization occurs, it does not necessarily lead to bias assimilation, close-\nmindedness, dichotomization and disagreement and conflict escalating attitudes. Therefore, if\nthe reasoning and proof brought in favor of these propositions are compelling, debate\ndetractors must have made mistakes in determining that debate is detrimental.\nOne of these mistakes is hasty generalization. Hasty generalization happens when a\nconclusion is drawn before enough evidence is found (Groarke and Tindale, 2008: 282) or\nwhen we conclude too much on too little evidence (Tindale, 2007: 150). Quite often\ncompetitive debate is deemed detrimental just because other categories of debate have\nnegative features. For example, public debates or TV debates\u2019 negative features are\n336 transferred to competitive debate (Tannen, 1988, 2002), negative features in debates influence\nthe idea of competitive debate (Moulton, 1983, Tannen, 2002) and the negative features of a\nhighly competitive debate (Cf. Ehninger, 1952; Ulrich, 1986b) are extended to competitive\ndebate in toto (Johnson and Johnson, 1994; Tannen, 1988, 2002).\nActually, hasty generalization occurs regardless whether negative and positive types of\ndebate are distinguished. For example, Tannen argues that neither debating nor all oppositions\nare evil. In her, The Argument Culture, she clearly states, \u201cIn a word, the type of opposition I\nam questioning is what I call \u2018agonism\u2019\u201d, namely an automatic warlike stance (Tannen, 1999:\n10), and \u201cThe message of this book is not, \u2018Let\u2019s stop arguing and be nice to each other.\u2019\nQuite the contrary, the message is, \u2018Let\u2019s look more closely at the effect of the ritualized\nopposition, so we can have the real arguments.\u2019 The opposite of argument culture is not being\n\u2018nice\u2019 and avoiding conflict; it is finding constructive ways of arguing, debating, and\nconfronting conflict\u201d (ibidem: 6). However, the whole book seems to be an invective against\nevery kind of debate. Indeed, in The Argument Culture, as in her other papers on this topic (Cf.\nTannen, 2000, 2002), Tannen herself does not seem to talk about positive types of opposition,\nor even about positive aspects of debate, except in the conclusion where she states: \u201cI\u2019m\nmoving away from a narrow view of debate, we need not give up conflict and criticism\naltogether. Quite the contrary, we can develop more varied \u2013 and more constructive \u2013 ways of\nexpressing opposition and negotiating disagreement\u201d (ibidem: 298). Thus, either debate is evil\nor debate and some types of opposition are positive. However, no examples of positive\ndebates and types of opposition are advanced. Hence, from her framework, that debate is evil\ncan be seen in many of her writings vehemently detracting from debating64. Indeed, it is\ndifficult to understand how competitive debate should be distinguished from agonism and\nhow, in her framework, debating could play a positive role. Consequently, even if some\n64 Actually, some types of opposition are presented in Tannen (1998). Nonetheless, when these types are relevant\nto our discussion, they are shown to be based just on authority or prejudiced evaluation of reasoning and\nevidence.\n337 prerequisites protecting premises from attack are presented (see Fogelin & Sinott-Armstrong,\n1997, p. 42), there is still room for hasty generation; unless further justifications/clarifications\nare given by the author.\nSome other scholars seem to commit a different mistake than hasty generalization. The\nway debaters behave in a debating match is considered an impact of debate practice, namely a\nprocedural effect with an educational impact. For example, Johnson and Johnson (1994)\ndepict a debater as denying \u201cthe legitimacy of others\u2019 needs and feelings, and see the situation\nonly from their own perspective\u201d (ibidem: 118) or as \u201cunwilling to make concession to the\nopponent\u2019s viewpoint, and close-mindedly refuse to incorporate any of it into their own\nposition\u201d (Johnson and Johnson, 2000: 3-22). However, what Johnson and Johnson point out\nin these quotations are not debate impacts. They are talking about the prescribed sets of\nbehavior characterized by the debating match because of the rules of the match itself, i.e.\ndebate role behavior. In fact, developing an issue from only one\u2019s own point of view,\nignoring others\u2019 perspectives and avoiding making risky concessions for oneself are\nlegitimate behaviors in debating matches. Nonetheless, this does not mean that a debater\nbehaves in this manner, on all occasions. It would mean coming to the conclusion that a\njudoka usually fights people just because in competitions he or she struggles violently with an\nopponent.\nConfusing procedural effects, i.e. role behavior, with educational impacts is mostly\ncommitted by cooperative learning supporters. These supporters sometimes seem to suggest\nthat cooperative types of dialogue are better than competitive types on the basis that, at the\nend of the match, cooperative types of dialogue motivate students to agree instead of\ndisagreeing. For example, Johnson and Johnson (2000) conclude that debaters refuse to\nincorporate any opponent\u2019s point of view into their own position, and Felton et. al. (2009) are\nof the opinion that, students in the deliberative condition are more likely to craft arguments\n338 that acknowledge opposing viewpoints. However, as pointed out before, these outcomes must\nbe recognized as debate or deliberative roles rather than dwelling on their educational impact.\nLikewise, from an argumentative point of view, agreement cannot be considered as the\ncriteria of distinguishing sound arguments from bad ones. It is always possible for two parties\nto reach an agreement using fallacious arguments because reaching an agreement could be a\nsimple, or the expected way, of getting good marks in school.\nA similar misinterpretation seems to be committed by Walton (1995) when he\nconfuses debate\u2019s accidental features with the essence of debate or the ideal debate, i.e. debate\nhypothetical optimum. He declares that, \u201cdebaters can score good points and can win over a\njudge or audience successfully even while using bad or fallacious arguments\u201d. However, if\ndebate exhibits some features of the eristic dialogue it does not mean that the debate is or\nshould be performed as an eristic dialogue, as Walton seems to suggest (1994, 2008). Instead,\nin competitive debate the judge is in a position to reward effective argumentative techniques\nand to discourage the use of poor arguments (Ulrich, 1986a). In addition, the purposes often\ncited as overall goals of judging are to promote the educational aspects of academic debate, to\npromote fairness in the activity and to establish a favorable atmosphere for quality\ncompetition in debates (ibidem: 2). The achievement of these goals cannot be compared with\nallowing poor or fallacious arguments to flourish. Moreover, even if a debate team could win\na match using fallacious arguments, reaching an agreement in a critical discussion type of\ndialogue does not avoid the same critique. It is always possible that, in a critical discussion,\nan agreement or persuasion is reached based on fallacious arguments if parties do not\nrecognize such arguments as fallacious. Nonetheless, critical discussions are not considered\neristic.\nThe last mistake emphasized seems to imply another conceptual confusion: debate\nformat\u2019s theoretical implications are often confused with educational impact. Andrews (1995)\n339 and Tumposky (2004) suggest that considering the dialectic structure of debate a\nsimplification seems to imply that debaters simplify issues. However, this is a mistake. As we\nhave seen before, debaters understand issues better, and when they are preparing for debates,\nthey acknowledge problematic issues. Therefore, it is likely that, this kind of mistake ensues\nfrom a recurrent misconception, which is considering competitive debate only as a strictly\nruled type of competitive dialogue (Wood and Goodnight, 1994). Even if this definition is\ncorrect from a strictly theoretical point of view, from a pedagogical and practical perspective\nit is not exhaustive. In fact, debate also encompasses information seeking dialogue, where\neach debater looks for and shares information with teammates; critical discussion, where\nteammates explore issues together; negotiation, where teammates try to reach an agreement\non organizational matters; and deliberation, where, for example, teammates have to decide\nwhich arguments to bring into the debate (Cf. Backer, 2010). Recognizing the need for a\nwider set of skills for debating than those strictly related to the match reveals how complete a\ntool debate is and how important cultivating all the skills associated with debate is for\nargumentation education. Additionally, promoting this idea of academic debate will help\nscholars to give a clearer idea of debate itself and its impacts. This will strengthen debate\nfrom oversimplification by those who consider debate just a way of making a prejudice more\nsound (Cf. Bono de, 1985). This is also a challenge that future researchers should face.\n5. Conclusion\nDebate is not detrimental. It is neither necessary nor likely that it leads to polarization.\nDebaters who advocate a counter-attitudinal side do not polarize but de-polarize, and debaters\u2019\nde-polarization could be promoted by making debaters shift side many times, or by adopting\nappropriate procedures as the 5\u2019R model describes. Also among those who polarize, debate\ndoes not necessarily lead to bias assimilation, close-mindedness, dichotomization or\n340 escalating conflict attitudes. Thus, polarization is not a necessary \u201cside effect\u201d of debate even\nif some of the negative consequences mentioned so far could occur in some debaters when\ntraining or judging is inadequate.\nNonetheless, important suggestions on unpleasant features or consequences such as\neristic, exaggerate agonism, and issues simplification must be kept in mind. As educators, it is\nalways important to make every effort to avoid such undesired consequences. Moreover,\noutcomes that stress other types of dialogue having greater positive impact than debate, as a\nmore active search for information outside the class (Johnson and Johnson, 1985) or more\nevidence quotation (Felton et al. 2009), must be considered with open-mindedness and\ncuriosity. They could suggest we consider debate from a wider and more complex perspective,\nand to develop the appropriate training. Indeed, team members preparing for competitive\ndebate also engage in negotiation, when they organize for effective cooperation, in\ninformation-seeking dialogue, when they share information, in critical discussion, when they\ndevelop and test cases, in deliberation, when they choose strategy for the debate match, and\nfinally in debate. From this perspective, debate could be seen as a complete tool for\nargumentation education because it provides a wide set of argumentative dialogues to work\nwith and it assures, at the same time, the fundamental ingredient of argumentation itself:\ndisagreement and confrontation (Jackson, 2002; Marttunen, 1992). As Willard (1988)\nsuggests, disagreement is not a problem, but a value in itself; if we let it flourish, if we\ntolerate it and if we correctly manage it, we avoid conformity, we do not compromise\ndemocracy and we do not lose our liberty.\nReferences\nAlden R.

Through the\nlecture, listening, analysis and explicit teaching of the argumentative topics and stylistic figures found in a\nhybrid literary-argumentative text, students were conduced to the mimesis and genesis of multiple persuasive\narguments. Imitatio seemed to influence positively the student\u2019s argumentative writing. The qualitative analysis\nof the final written argumentative texts showed a better awareness of the argumentative genre. Also, the\nquantification of data revealed an increased use of the argumentative topics of relations (cause-effect, antithesis)\nand of the figure of rhetorical questions.\nKey words: imitation, argumentative writing, genre, elementary school\n1. Introduction\nDiachronically and interdisciplinarilyy the act of mimeisthai [\u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 /mimisthe], the\nnotion of imitation, consists of a pivotal but, also, diversified, disputed or \u2018elusive\u2019 term\n(Fanner and Arrington, 1993:13) in many cognitive fields. Either as the representation of the\nreal world in art and literature or as the deliberate imitation of various social behaviors and\neven more as pedagogical practice, imitatio or mimesis obtained fervent theoretical supporters\nas well as bitter enemies who tried either to reveal or to underestimate its value.\n2. Historic roots of imitatio in rhetorical pedagogy\n2.1 The ancient theoretical pedigree\nSophistic rhetoric identifies imitation as a necessary factor of the development of\nsuccessful orators. Besides, sophists are considered the first imitators of oral rhapsodies\n(Schiappa, 1999:6).\n354 As regards Plato and Aristotle, they both accept the contribution of imitation to\nlearning even if they don\u2019t perceive it as an emulating practice (Corbett, 1971:243). For Plato,\nthe positive or negative evaluation of imitation depends on its role in the acquisition of the\nideal truth. Finally, he approves its use as a medium capable of educating the Republic\u2019s\nfuture, ideal citizens (Plato, 1937; Tate, 1932:161).\nIn Phaedrus Socrates presents an analogous bilateral attitude towards it. On the one\nhand, he applies the art of imitation by offering a more accurate version of Lysias\u2019 speech and\nhe accepts, explicitly, the existence of ideal models of orators. On the other hand, he advises\nPhaedrus not to imitate entirely a speech which contains bad examples of what he considers as\ntrue rhetoric (Plato, 1993, 278b 4-5:201, 264e 5-7).\nAs with Aristotle, he recognizes that through imitation, as an inherent impulse, \u2018a kind\u2019\nof learning is realized (\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u03af \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 / manthanein ti symvainei), accompanied with\na certain feeling of pleasure which derives from the syllogism that the object of imitation is\nidentified with the prototype (Aristotle, Rhetoric, I, x-xi, 1371b:176). McKeon holds the\nopinion that Aristotle doesn\u2019t invoke the imitation of prior orators (1936:27) despite\nAristotle\u2019s lessons about arguments from example and about exemplar heros - both as models\npraiseworthy to be imitated.\nThe history of the vigorous support of imitation as a method of acquiring rhetorical\nexcellence has begun. It is accepted that Isocrates first highlighted its guaranteed role in the\nsuccessful practice of philosophy. In his Against the Sophists, he attributes to the teacher -\nconsequently to himself - the obligation to function as a model for his students in order to\nhelp them \u201c\u2026appear more florid and graceful\u201d (Cagarin, 2000:65). Also, in the theoretical\nframework of Isocrates\u2019 paideia, imitation should be practiced, equally, at three levels; at the\nlevel of action, of thought and of speech (Haskins, 2000:18, 22). It is due to imitative\n355 exercises of various kinds of discourse that Isocrates inserted imitation in the field of writing\nbecause of its close relation to exercitatio (practice) (Fleming, 2003:109; Kinneavy, 1984:74).\n2.2 Greco-Roman conceptions of imitatio\nIn the Rhetorica ad Herennium, imitatio is viewed as an independent training method\nand as an important aid for achieving rhetorical proficiency combined with ars (theory) and\nexercitatio (practice) (II, ii, 3). In his turn, Cicero shares the above ideas and he reinforces\nIsocrates\u2019 previous concepts about the immeasurable value of carefully selected models of\ncreative imitation (Muckelbauer, 2003:69). As Antonius, he doesn\u2019t avoid proving his\nargument using the example of Sulpicius and the positive influence received by the imitation\nof his contemporary model, Crassus. All the same, Cicero highlights that the deliberate\nselection of a model - even an actor\u2019s model - must be strictly accompanied by the exclusive\nand exhaustive imitation of its \u2018marvelous characteristics\u2019. Also, he emphasizes its pivotal\nrole in the acquisition and transmission of a certain style (elocutio) (De Oratore, II, xxii,\n92:159; xxiii:160).\nLonginus, following Cicero, recognizes that the elevation of the poetic style is due to\nthe imitation of major, prior models. Imitatio is conceived as an emulative practice which\nhonors the imitators even if their talent is not comparable to the models (Longinus, 1999,\nXIII:71,73). Analogous ideas about style and imitation are also found in other treatises like\nDemetrius\u2019, On Style and Dionysius\u2019 of Halicarnassus, On Imitation. The author of the latter,\nfragmentally saved treatment, encourages the imitation of older attic authors in order to\nelevate the style of the writers of his era. Examining the nature, the models and the process of\nimitation, Dionysius credits it, equally, with procedural and psychological features subtly\ninterwoven (Demetrius, 1902:22; McKeon, 1936:28; Clark, 1951:13).\n2.3 Quintilian and the pedagogical use of imitatio\n356 Beyond any doubt, Quintilian inserts imitation as a crucial pedagogical practice in the\neducational history of Roman Provincial, Medieval and Renaissance schools. For Quintilian,\nthe training of students in declamatio requires, first, the conscious imitation of excellent\nmodels, cautiously selected by the teacher of literature, the grammaticus. It is by imitating \u2018a\nstock of words, a variety of figures and the art of composition\u2019 that students will be led on the\ndesirable route of the personal inventio and the intended facilitas (Institutes of Oratory, X, ii,\n1:334-5, Murphy, 1996:584). On the other hand, Quintilian admits the finite power of\nimitative practice (X, ii, 8:335). Its educational energy becomes acceptable due to the possible\ngenerative and creative results which it may incur to students. Imitation is not considered to\nbe a passive process but, rather, an agonistic one. The \u2018ideal\u2019 orator is challenged to reason\nand to emulate the offered models through the addition of personal elements and the\nsubstitution or deletion of existent features of the proposed discourse or style. In this sense,\nimitation acts as an incentive force which stimulates the cognitive, aesthetic, functional and\nlinguistic choices of the imitator.\nIn the medieval period, Saint Augustine seems to draw upon Quintilian\u2019s teachings.\nHe couples imitation, as a rhetorical method of cultivating the expression of discourse (modus\npreferendi), with Christian ideas. He explicitly suggests that for future preachers the imitation\nof prior models like the holy scriptures are a safe way of acquiring eloquence and wisdom\n(Saint Augustin, 1958:154-5).\nSimilar Greco-Roman ideas about imitation can be easily detected in the era of\nEnglish Renaissance education. In the influential work of Wilson (1560), The Arte of\nRhetorique, the author admits the necessity of \u2018following the waies of wifemen\u2019, by taking\n\u2018\u2026fome colour of them\u2026\u2019 (p.5). Imitation is recognized as an undeniable method of learning\nto speak and write eloquently, since the model of the literate man represented the person \u2018who\ncould speak spontaneously, copiously and persuasively on any subject\u2019 (Rhodes, 1992:43).\n357 2.4 The period of the crisis\nThe methodic and systematic commitment of Erasmus to copiousness is considered to\nbe a representative example of Tudor\u2019s educational trend. For Erasmus, the passionate\npractice of imitative exercises for the achievement of various educational purposes focuses,\nespecially, on students\u2019 moral training (Desiderius, 1978:682-3). Unfortunately, his effort\ncan\u2019t be paralleled with Plutarch\u2019s example. By presenting both the Lives of honest and bad\nmen \u2013 as mimetic poles or as models to avoid \u2013 Plutarch aimed at the formation of virtuous\ncharacters (Duff, 2002). On the contrary, Erasmus intended to students\u2019 ethical indoctrination\naccording to current Christian demands influencing in a catalytic way the imitative pedagogy\nof his era. The semantic distortion of the term imitatio is a consequence of the alteration to\nclassical principles of its practice by Erasmus. (Erdmann, 1993:3, 10)\nThis seems to start the ongoing crisis of imitatio in pedagogy and, especially, in the\nfield of writing. The passage of the 18th century may be characterized as a dark page in its\nhistory. Scholars ascribe the decline to two main reasons. First, imitation is interpreted as a\nsterile and passive act of copying stripped of all positive, assimilative characteristics.\nEspecially, in the writing domain rhetorical pedagogy and, consequently, imitation, are\nconsidered to be responsible for a mechanistic, predetermined and skill-based mode of writing.\nSecond, the Romantic movement, obsessed by the principle of personal genius, fights against\nthe commonly shared characteristics of imitative elaboration and production (Welch,\n1986:167; Knoblauch & Brannon, 1984:80; Starkey, 1974). In addition, Sullivan (1989)\naccuses imitation of lacking the desirable scientism that should characterize every educational\npractice. In contrast with the process theories of writing, imitatio insults the teacher\u2019s\nscholarship. Fanner and Arrington (1993) point out the importance of the new, negative\ntheoretical orientation towards imitation insofar as it results in its long-lasting marginalization\n(p. 24).\n358 Despite the downfall of imitatio in England, pedagogical practices in America in the\nbeginning of the 19th century still reflect its classical principles as a mean for developing\nstudents\u2019 knowledge and mental discipline. An interesting approach of the theoretical\nconversion towards imitation after the American Civil War is presented by Wilson (2003),\nwho correlates it with racial politics. He supports the deliberate redefinition of the term in\npedagogy to be a constraint on the threat of black imitation of the \u2018dominant systems of white\npower\u2019 (p. 89).\n2.5 The modern look at imitation\nDuring the 20th century the value of imitation remains disputable. Perplexity may be\nthe term that best describes the state of whoever seeks to research the issue. On the one hand,\nimitation finds theoretical refuge in structural and post-modern literary theories which seem to\nencourage the use of imitatio in the teaching of writing (Minock, 1995:492). Bakhtinian\nnotions such as heteroglossia, polyphony and dialogism presuppose the incessant interaction,\nthe uninterrupted dialogue with another\u2019s utterances (Bakhtin, 1986). Structuralists like\nKristeva and Barthes (1981) invoke, implicitly, the act of imitation through the notion of\nintertextuality, since every text is paralleled with a \u2018mosaic\u2019 made by the \u2018absorption and\ntransformation\u2019 of others (Kristeva, 1986:37). Genette (1997), also, admits its importance and\ntalks, explicitly, about \u2018mimotexts\u2019 (pp. 75, 81). For post-moderns, such as Derrida (1988), a\nlinguistic sign, oral or written, acquires its identity as such due to its capacity for being\niterated, replicated.\nOn the other hand, the process theories of writing consist of the main theoretical\nadversary of imitation. For Berlin (1988) the development of cognitive rhetoric changed the\nwhole picture of writing and, consequently, influenced the imitative practice. Apparently, the\nascendant criticism of imitation in the 1980\u2019s is not incidental. It is, exactly, the date of birth\nof Flower and Hayes\u2019 (1981) three-fold cognitive model of writing, composed by such\n359 elements as the task environment, the writer\u2019s long-term memory and the writing processes.\nThe three writing actions of the continuously expanded model, planning, translating and\nreviewing, consist of an onslaught on product theories that emphasize the role of \u2018assisted\u2019\nimitation in learning and in writing development (Bereiter and Scardamalia, 1981; Flower et\nal., 1986; Gee, 1997:25; Pincas, 1982:24).\nNotwithstanding their expansion, process theories didn\u2019t remain impervious to\ncriticism (Horowitz, 1986). Since 1990 the development of genre-based approaches seem to\ndissent from viewing writing, only, as an \u2018unconscious process\u2019 between the writer and his\nunreachable inner world (Swales, 1990; Tribble, 1996; Badger and White, 2000:155).\nTeaching writing via genre-approaches serves not only for learning particular \u2018patterns of\nforms\u2019 but, mainly, as Miller (1984) points out, for participating \u2018in the actions of a\ncommunity\u2019 (p. 165). In this theoretical framework, imitation is accepted, even partially, as a\nuseful pedagogical means to the development of writing. Genre based models of writing\npropose strategies which include the modeling of the target-genre and the analysis of the\norganization of textual patterns for teaching literacy and writing (Cope and Kalantzis, 1993;\nDevitt et al., 2003; Beaufort, 2007:178). Such actions recall the classic activities of\nprogymnasmata as the reading aloud of the text, textual analysis and transliteration. Similar\ntechniques are used in modern workshops of creative writing, while the practice of imitation\nin writing is already inserted in the curriculum of teachers in Denmark (Fleming, 2003, Geist,\n2004:170).\nThe long pedagogical tradition of imitation influenced the two-fold aim of this paper.\nFirst, the theoretical and diachronic review of its practice attempted to gain a deeper\ncomprehension of the way that could, still, facilitate the modern rhetorical pedagogy. Second,\nit is examined whether its practice could still facilitate students\u2019 familiarity with\nargumentative writing. The research reveals an explicit commitment to classical rhetorical\n360 teachings as well as to modern instructive practices. Moreover, it challenges the repetition (or\nimitation!) of similar efforts in the future.\n3. Purpose of the research\nThe purpose of the research was the examination of the influence of imitation on a random\nsample of beginner students in the field of argumentative writing in a Greek primary school.\nEmphasis was placed on its use in order to foster students\u2019 argumentative capacities in writing,\nand especially, in the inventio of arguments due to the development of topics.\n4. Materials and methods\n4.1 Theory and methodology\nThe following research describes a classroom intervention with 23 pupils, 11-years old, in\nthe fifth (5th ) grade of a public primary school in Alimos, an urban zone of Athens. The\nexperimental group consisted of 14 boys and 9 girls who shared an homogeneous middle class\nsocial back-ground.\nThe experimental group had no previous training experience in argumentative writing.\nDuring the intervention the researcher acted as a participant observer trying to direct the\ninstruction of the proposed text-model and to observe students\u2019 reactions.\nThe intervention was influenced by the socio-cultural theory of learning and by the\nprinciples of mediated and rhetorical pedagogy (Bazerman, 2009:283). According to Vygotsky\nimitation consists of a necessary process of \u2018stepping from something one knows to something new\u2019.\nCoupled with instruction, imitation activates latent qualities in order to advance students\u2019 learning in\nthe zone of proximal development and t\u03bf transfer them to the potential level of their cognitive\ndevelopment (Vygotsky, 1962:103; Vygotsky, 1978:87).\nAlso, according to the socio-cultural theory, learning may be achieved due to the scaffolding\nmethod and the mediation of cultural tools as a text (Wood et al., 1976). For the text oriented\n361 approach of literacy the use of texts may contribute positively to students\u2019 development of written\ncompetence (Fterniati and Spinthourakis, 2005/2006).\nBased on Pike\u2019s (1959) metaphor of particle, wave and field, we tried to find out\nwhich were the scaffolding effects of the analysis and explicit instruction of some common\ntopics and stylistic patterns, found in an extract of a literary text (particle) through imitation,\nfirst, to a student\u2019s argumentative letter of the same content in order to create the necessary\nprior knowledge in written argumentation (wave) and, second, to a free written argumentative\nletter (field).\nThe corpus of data was composed: a) by transcripts from audio-taped instruction in the\nclassroom and b) by students\u2019 individual pre- (Text A) and post-tests (Text B and Text C) in\nthe form of informal argumentative letters. The writing of the texts was carried out before\n(Text A) and after (Text A, Text B) the lecture and the analysis of the text-model. The effects\nof imitation in students\u2019 writing were analysed in qualitative and quantitative terms\n(triangulation of data) in order to provide validity and reliability to the research. The\nqualitative analysis was based on Fairclough\u2019s three-dimensional model of critical discourse\nanalysis which examines both features of grammar or vocabulary as well as features of the\ntextual organization and the appearance of genres in the produced texts. (Fairclough,\n1995:188-9; Blommaert and Bulcaen, 2000:448). The quantitative analysis used two\nstatistical tests: a) the Friedman and b) the Wilcoxon test. The category system was identified\nas reliable because of the calculation of Cohen\u2019s Kappa coefficient for two raters (Cohen\n1960). Alpha values of 0,907, 0,832 and 0,881 were obtained for the observations regarding\nthe existence of arguments of cause and effect in the student\u2019s written texts A, B and C\ncorrespondingly. A high statistical significance of Kappa for the Text A was noticed (overall\nk=0,907 p<0,001). Therefore, there was evidence that the observation system used by the\nresearcher was valid.\n362 4.2 Materials development and teaching intervention\nThe intervention was carried out for a total of six didactic hours of 45 minutes in a\nperiod of 7 days. The steps followed were:\na) First, the free writing of an informal, exhortative letter (Text A) to the mayor of the\ntown. By using arguments, students asked him not to permit the cutting of a tree for the\nconstruction of a new apartment building in the neighborhood (one didactic hour). The\nrequested text form of a letter was considered the most appropriate, since ars dictaminis\nintegrates elements of oral and written rhetoric, and also it can be an answer to an implicit,\nunderlying controversy, well-hidden beneath its structure (East, 1968:242). The text A served\nas a basic criterion of students\u2019 initial writing and as a point of reference in comparison with\nthe two following texts.\nb) The next two days the reading and the analysis of an extract with analogous\ncontent65 followed (three didactic hours). The extract, written in dialogic form, was taken\nfrom the novel My friend, the filbert tree66 (1982:72-3).\nThe selection of the text satisfied the basic criteria of an exemplum for linguistic,\nstylistic, literary and active (ethical) imitation as proposed by Lausberg (1998:13;\nPapadopoulou, 1999:49). The comprehensible language, the vivacity of expression, the\ncontent explaining ecological and citizenship issues and the use of common topics and sub-\ntopics made it appropriate for the research. In short, the text provided the space for the\nconnection of rhetorical and social features necessary for learning the argumentative genre.\nAt a first level, the lecture of the text-model offered an alternative approach to the\nexamined issue and provoked in students an \u2018inner dialogue\u2019, relative to the post-hoc\n65 A little boy, Doros, saves Fundu (the tree) who is in danger, from the constructor, the bulldozer, the mechanic and the chopper. from the\nconstructor, the bulldozer, the mechanic, the chopping\n66 The book of Angeliki Varela was chosen to represent Greece at the international competition of books for children, and it was awarded one\nof the three \u201cHonourable Mentions\u201d from the International Award, JANUSZ KORCAC in 1985.\n363 performance of their writing and to the genre\u2019s learning (Stables, 2003:9-10; Spencer,\n1982:43; Myers, 1983:15). According to Winterowd \u2018you learn to write by (usually)\nunconscious imitation of what you read\u2019 (1975:117-8).\nThe text was read twice: a) A read-aloud lecture was carried out by the researcher.\nThen, a genre analysis of the segment was made by following the lebovean model (Labov,\n1972) of questions about: a) the abstract (what was the text about?), b) the orientation (who\nparticipated? where? for what?), c) the complicating action (what will happen after the\ninterview?), d) the evaluation (why do you think this segment was interesting?), e) the result\n(what do you think that will be the result of the interview taken?). The segment, as a form of\ndiscursive interaction, was correlated with the social event that caused it, while the aims of the\n\u2018strategic action\u2019 of the heroes (f.e. justification of an opinion, persuasion) were emphasized\n(Fairclough, 2003:65, 70-1).\nb) Then, in an independent reading level, students underlined the arguments presented in\nthe text. The arguments provided, were characteristic examples of two main categories of\ncommon topics and sub-topics as presented in the taxonomy of Corbett and Connors\n(1999:87):\na) The common topic of comparison (similarity, difference of degree). For example:\n- \u201cWe are attached to trees!\u201d she told me. \u201cWe look alike. They live and respire like\nus\u201d. (similarity / metaphor) and\nb) the common topic of relationship (cause and effect, antecedent and con-sequence,\nantithesis/contraries). For example:\n- \u201cStanding by trees, men should make the sign of cross, because trees inspire carbon\ndioxide and breathe out oxygen\u201d. (cause and effect)\n- If someone wanted to cut down your filbert-tree what would you do? I asked George.\n-I would try to prevent him. (antecedent and consequence)\n364 Students focused their attention on the above organizational patterns and the analysis of\ntheir structure, based on the assumption that knowledge of common topics may facilitate the\nproduction of arguments on any future given subject (Zompetti, 2006:22). Accepting the idea\nthat topics may provide an argumentative classification, the above topics were modeled on the\nblackboard as petals of a flower. Each petal represented a different argumentative locus, a\ndifferent kind of thought which could help students in generating more arguments to support\ntheir opinion.\nFurthermore, during the text analysis students searched for the main stylistic features used\nby the author, such as metaphors and rhetorical questions. Scholars propose that such an effort\nimproves students\u2019 personal linguistic and stylistic expression as well as their syntactic\ncompetence (D\u2019 Angelo, 1973). For example:\n- \u201cA tree is a breathe of life\u201d. (metaphor)\n- \u201cMister Mayor, I learnt that a Dutch airline offered to Athens forty thousands tulips.\nAnd you, can\u2019t you offer not even a tree to neighborhood\u2019s children?\u201d (antithesis\nexpressed in a form of rhetorical question)\nc) The writing of a second letter (Text B) to the mayor with the same theme followed (one\ndidactic hour). The change of the dialogic extract in a letter-form was an attempt to give a\nmore dynamic character to the imitative practice similar to the classical rhetorical exercise of\nparaphrase or, in intertextuality terms, to the strategy of adaptation of the original text\n(Sanders, 2006:26; Clark, 1951:20).\nd) Three days later, students carried out a similar writing task (Text C) (one didactic hour).\nThis time, the theme of the argumentative letter was: You want desperately a pet. Write a\nletter to your mother trying to convince her with your arguments to buy it. The activity\nhighlighted the effects of the prior imitative practice, mainly, of the topical invention of\narguments and examined whether the results obtained could be dynamically transferred to a\n365 new writing attempt relative to a different content and context, to a \u2018new conceptual intention\u2019\n(Kelly, 1987:375).\n5. Results\n5.1 Qualitative analysis\nThe students\u2019 first, free written argumentative letter (Text A) revealed the necessity of\naccurate instruction of argumentative writing. First, the prevalence of a written narrative\nschemata became obvious. Five students (N=5, 21,7% in the total sample) didn\u2019t respond to\nthe demand of writing a letter. On the contrary, they developed the subject in the only well-\nknown method, the narration. For example:\n\u25cf \u201cIt was Friday, the day of the assembly for examining if my beloved tree should be cut\ndown. The majority supported the opinion that it should, definitely, be cut down. I had to\nreact quickly. The only solution was to send a letter to the mayor. \u2026 (Yannis)\u201d\nEmphasis was placed on the chronological organization of personal experiences with\nthe beloved tree:\n\u25cf \u201cWell, I and my friends we have grown up with that tree. We were 7 years old when\nwe played over there. When we were 8 years old we played on the swing and now that we\nhave turned 10 years old we have made a tree-house and you want to cut it down.\n(Konstantinos)\u201d\nSecond, students\u2019 writing revealed their limited prior knowledge in developing\narguments. The mean of the produced arguments was low. The initial letters were very short\nin length, while stylistic elements were scarcely present.\nThe majority of written arguments was presented either in the introduction or in the\nconclusion of the texts, while the rest of the letter was, mainly, dedicated to recalling personal\nmemories. Even when arguments were given in an explicit form, they usually made part of the\nknowledge-telling model of writing (i). For example:\n366 (i) \u201cI ask you not to cut down my neighbourhood\u2019s tree because I used to play over\nthere, to climb and to sit on its branches.\u201d (Minas)\nIn the second text (Text B), students as sensible citizens developed a more accurate\nand extended argumentation in order to support their thesis based on a critical interaction with\nthe problem emerged (Terrill, 2011:301). For example:\n\u25cf \u201cResolving this problem is crucial for all the children of our neighborhood, because we are\nthe habitants of the zone and you can\u2019t take decisions against our rights.\u201d (Thanos)\nTwo were the main persuasive strategies used: 1) First, the removal of personal\nexperiences. Students approached the interests\u2019 of the receiver of their arguments invoking\neither personal motives (i), or personal experiences (ii), fears and bias (iii) as shown by the\nfollowing examples:\n(i)\u201cAll the mayors until now showed an increased interest for the trees of our neighbourhood.\nThis is the reason why you should stop cutting the hazel. Do you imagine the consequences of\nyour action if it will be repeated and repeated in the future? That\u2019s why we would propose\nyou not to be the first mayor who will start this destructive action.\u201d (John)\n(ii) \u201cTo my opinion this tree shouldn\u2019t be cut down, because we used to play there since we\nwere too young as, also, you did when you were a little boy.\u201d (Maria)\n(iii)\u201cAlso, if you permit it, the citizens won\u2019t vote for you\u201d (Theodoris)\n2) Second, students allowed the appearance of passion in their speech, mainly, due to the use\nof the stylistic element of rhetorical questions (iv) invoking further socio-economic\nparameters.\n(ii) \u201cWhat is more important for you\u2026oxygen or money?\u201d (Helen)\nAlso, in the third text (Text C) students used as evidence examples taken either from\nthe mythology (i.e. the powerful relationship between Ulysses and his dog) or from the\nfriendly \u2018milieu\u2019, while their lexical, syntactic and functional choices were more accurate.\n367 5.2 Quantitative analysis\nThe basic criteria of students\u2019 pre- (Text A) and post- tests (Text B and C) quantitative\nanalysis with the S.P.S.S. (statistical package for the social sciences) were:\na) The number of all the written arguments of each text. The argumentative unit consisted of\none or more sentences which guaranteed the basic structure of the argument (Caccamise, 1987;\nKellogg, 1990).\nb) The number of arguments based on the topics of: (i) cause and effect, (ii) antithesis, (iii)\nantecedent and consequent (expressed by conditional conjunctions), (iv) similarity and v)\ndifference of degree.\nc) The number of stylistic elements. More specifically, a rating scale from 0-2 was created.\nThe existence of (i) metaphors (0-1) and of b) rhetorical questions (0-1) was marked.\nd) Text length: counting the words of a text provided a useful analytical device.\nAs an alternative test for the one-way repeated measures ANOVA, the Friedman\nanalysis of variance by ranks was used because of the sample size of our research (23\nstudents). The Friedman test consisted of a non-parametrical test which detected differences\nacross multiple test attempts at a significant level of 5%. In our case the attempts were\nrepresented by the texts A, B and C. Furthermore, the Wilcoxon\u2019s test was used in order to\ndetect which texts contained statistical significant differences. The significance level of\n0.05/3=0,017 was calculated with the Bonferroni adjustment.\nThe practice of imitatio was considered as the independent variable of the research\n(YES/NO) (Verma and Mallick, 1999). The total number of the written arguments, the\nnumber of arguments based on the above mentioned topics, the number of stylistic elements\nand the text length constituted the dependent variables.\nThe experimental group produced a higher total mean of written arguments as attested\nby the statistical analysis. The initial mean of arguments M=1,09 (SD=0,900) in the Text A\n368 increased after the intervention. In the Text B the mean raised (M= 3,65, SD=1,849) as well\nas in the Text C (M=3,70, SD=1,329) (Figure 1). The analysis showed a significant\ndifference among the mean of arguments of texts B and A (p=0,000<0,017) and of texts C and\nA (p=0,000<0,017), while the difference among the texts B and C wasn\u2019t significant.\nTEXT A TEXT B TEXT C\nMean \u00b1 SD 1,09 \u00b1 0,900 3,65 \u00b1 1,849* 3,70 \u00b1 1,329 ^\n* Significant difference among the mean of arguments of texts B and A, p=0,000<0,017\n^ Significant difference among the mean of arguments of texts C and A, p=0,000<0,017\nFig. 1 Total mean of written arguments in texts A, B and C\nThe produced arguments were mainly based on the topic of relationship as expressed\nby the sub-topics of cause and effect (M=0,52, SD=0,593:Text A, M=1,70, SD=1,222:Text B\nand M=2,04, SD=1,022:Text C) (Figure 3), of antithesis (M=0,13, SD=0,344:Text A, M=0,78,\nSD=0,736:Text B and M=0,78, SD=0,671:Text C) (Figure 2) and of antecedent and\nconsequent (M=0,13:Text A, M=0,52:Text B and M=0,57:Text C) (Fig. 4).\n369 0.8\n0.6\nn 0.78 0.78\na e 0.4\nM\n0.2\n0.13\n0\nTEXT A TEXT B TEXT C\nAntithesis arguments\nFig. 2: Mean of arguments based on the topic of antithesis in texts A, B and C.\n2.5\n2\n1.5\nn\na\ne 2.04\nM\n1 1.7\n0.5\n0.52\n0\nTEXT A TEXT B TEXT C\nCause and effects arguments\nFig. 3: Mean of arguments based on the topic of cause and effect in texts A, B and C.\nTEXT A TEXT B TEXT C\nMean \u00b1 SD\nCause and effect 0,52 \u00b1 0,593 1,70 \u00b1 1,222* 2,04 \u00b1 1,022^\narguments\n370 Mean \u00b1 SD\nAntithesis 0,13 \u00b1 0,344 0,78 \u00b1 0,736\u00d7 0,78 \u00b1 0,671\u2020\narguments\n* Significant difference among the mean of cause-effect arguments of texts B and A,\np=0,001<0,017\n^ Significant difference among the mean of cause-effect arguments of texts C and A,\np=0,000<0,017\n\u00d7 Significant difference among the mean of antithesis arguments of texts B and A,\np=0,002<0,017\n\u2020 Significant difference among the mean of antithesis arguments of texts C and A,\np=0,001<0,017\nThe difference of cause and effect arguments was significant among texts \u0392 and \u0391\n(p=0,001<0,017) and among texts C and \u0391 (p=0,000<0,017), while the difference among the\ntexts B and C was not statistically significant (p=0,193>0,017).

Discussion\nThe statistical results affirmed that the practice of imitation stimulated, significantly the\nstudents\u2019 cognitive, aesthetic, functional and linguistic choices. More precisely, its use\ncontributed to the students\u2019 better awareness of the argumentative genre as a bridge between\nfamiliar and unfamiliar textual genres (Prince, 1989:730).\nThe two texts-letters (Texts B and C) accomplished the necessary rhetorical\ninteraction among reality, reader and writer according to the demands of the new genre. First,\nthere was notice of critical restraint of the knowledge-telling model of writing and of its\nsubstitution by the model of knowledge-transforming, since students created more logical and\norganized argumentative patterns instead of narrative schemes (Grabe and Kaplan, 1996:125).\nSecond, the re-appearance of analogous statistical results in the third text (Text C) revealed a\nsuccessful transfer of the acquired knowledge in a new context reinforcing the view that\nlearning through imitation is not a passive and static process.\nIndeed, by imitating the presented argumentative topics and sub-topics, students\nconstructed in a more organized way their thought and produced more, accurate and valid\narguments, in contrast to the first text, independently of the subject matter (Freedman,\n374 1993:238; Nelson, 1970:121, 124; Infante, 1971:128). At the same time, they developed their\ncritical thought by discovering supporting reasons for their claims. Instead of a \u2018stultifying\nand inhibiting\u2019 practice, imitation became a liberating and empowering tool for argumentative,\npersuasive writing (Eschholz, 1980:24, Grubber, 1977:491). The increased use of the sub-\ntopics of cause and effect consisted of a device for the improvement of students\u2019 inductive\nthinking. Multiple possible adequate causes related to potential effects were produced.\nMoreover, the increased use of arguments based on the topic of antecedent and consequent\nrevealed a better performance of students\u2019 use of the hypothetical syllogism, while the\nincreased use of antithesis arguments led them to a dialectical game with opposite terms and\nideas in order to empower the validity of the proposed claims.\nFurthermore, the increased use of rhetorical questions, as a stylistic element, may be\nrelated to the interpersonal relations that emerged among the authors and the message\u2019s\nreceiver either as a mean of the author\u2019s imposition or as a tool facilitating the social contact\nof the participants. Finally, imitation activated features of the students\u2019 vocabulary which\nremained inert in the beginning of their writing efforts, since a significant increase to the text-\nlength was noticed (Texts B and C).\nBut, according to the classical teachings of Quintilian, imitation isn\u2019t a panacea.\nDespite the more persuasive character of the produced texts, its practice didn\u2019t influence\neither the production of arguments based on the topic of comparison or the use of metaphors.\nMore precisely, students showed weakness, especially in the final text (Text C), in the\ninvention of arguments based on the sub-topic of difference. Their limited use may be\nascribed to the subtle differentiation among the topics of difference and of antithesis as well\nas to the acknowledgement of the difficulty of their settling (Corbett and Connors, 1999:97,\n105). Finally, as regards the limited use of metaphors and the relative underdeveloped sub-\n375 topic of similarity, it may be related to the need for more interactive activities and students\u2019\njoint participation in classroom (Cameron, 1996).\n7. Conclusion\nTo conclude, the statistical results of the research showed that imitation should still serve\nas a useful method of teaching and learning in the field of writing and the acquisition of\nliteracy (Murphy, 1990; Mendelson, 2001:289). Its practice in a Greek primary school seemed\nto help the students who lack skills in argumentative writing. More specifically, the students\nimproved the form, the style and the content of their texts by releasing latent abilities even\nfrom the beginning of their efforts (Gorrell, 1987:53; Butler, 2002:26). The successful\nimitation of the argumentative topics concerning cause and effect, antecedent and consequent,\nantithesis, and rhetorical questions led to a variety of results. In particular, students were\nhelped towards the production of more elaborated texts, the development of argumentative\ngenre awareness and the construction of a solid basis upon which they placed the social\nartifact of argumentation. However, imitation doesn\u2019t exclude the practice of more interactive\nargumentative activities in the classroom. On the contrary, such activities in combination with\nimitation, may extend the acquired argumentative \u201ctextual basis\u201d facilitating students \u2018to\nunderstand what they are doing more deeply, more purposefully and more rhetorically\u2019\n(Devitt, 2004:202).\nReferences\nAristotle.

MEDIA\n384 Challenges of Rhetoric in the Era of \u2018Bytes and Likes\u2019\nPetra Acz\u00e9l, Corvinus University of Budapest\n\u201cRhetoric is no longer the title of a doctrine and a practice, nor a\nform of cultural memory; it becomes instead something like the\ncondition of our existence.\u201d (Bender\u2013Wellbery, 1990: 25)\n\u201cHow will our rhetorical and media theories need to be re-\nworked to account for the interactivity inherent in participatory\nentertainment?\u201d (Urbanski 2010: 67-68)\nSummary\nAlthough defined, traditionally, as the art of persuasion, rhetoric has always tended to outgrow its\noriginal concern. Its twofold disciplinary nature, of theory and practice (utens-docens as Burke named them), has\nbeen calling constantly for redefinitions and scientific legitimization. Often, scholars augured or stated the death\nand recognized and announced the rebirth of rhetoric. Anti/Postmodernist theories were seeking new horizons to\n(re)interpret it in a more \u2018integrative\u2019 way, introducing it to function as a communicative framework of all\nsocietal and mediated functions.\nIn the era of digital literacy and new media, rhetoric is facing new challenges which urge theoreticians\nto rediscover the hidden capacities of the classical faculty. Contributing to e\u2013rhetoric, netoric, digital and visual\nrhetoric, this paper intends to cast light upon the almost forgotten \u2018subdomains\u2019 of rhetoric and endeavours to\nprove its capability to be both the condition and the critical view of (new) media discourse.\nKey words: rhetorical ideal, new media, visual rhetoric, procedural rhetoric, spatial rhetoric,\naural rhetoric\n385 Prologue\nIn the second media age, the challenges to rhetoric concern mainly the faculty itself.\nThe new, semi-virtual, participative publicity media maintains and makes rhetoric enact in the\nway, originally, to which it was entitled. Although the classical \u201ctoolbar\u201d of rhetoric needs a\nbit of reconfiguring, rhetoric\u2019s main challenge is to discover its hidden fields and capacities\nwhich can offer more than the functionalist description of new media discourse. This chapter\naims at outlining a theoretical framework to interpret classical rhetoric in a new way; to show\nthe capaciousness of the ancient discipline; and to highlight those aspects and characteristics\nwhich relate rhetoric to new media in an organic way.\n1. Introduction\nRhetoric is a great survivor. It has escaped decades \u2013 if not centuries \u2013 of moral\nresentment, scholarly rejection, and democratic suspicion and remains ready and invigorated\nto re-enter the scholarly landscape and to influence practices of social discourse.\nUndoubtedly, rhetoric has been able to resist the attacks of those who considered it vague;\nsuperfluous; manipulative; or outdated. With more than 2500 years of disciplinary history, it\ngained considerable stamina to answer new challenges be they social; political; technological;\nor scientific.\nClassical rhetoric derives from the ancient Greek and Roman worlds where it served as\nthe universal science of the public sphere in which right acting and right speaking were\nconsidered one. Although defined as the art of persuasion, it has tended, with persuasive\npublic speaking, to outgrow always its original concern. Its genuine communicative, symbolic\nand strategic characteristics; its references to both the public and the personal; and its\n386 communicatively holistic nature have made rhetoric an interdisciplinary field of interpersonal,\nmediated and public discourse. In the classical tradition, a cultural ideal evolved, that of the\n\u201cpolitically and socially active polymath\u201d (Halloran, 1994: 332). This cultural ideal, regarded\nas the master of rhetoric, \u201cwas the man who had interiorized all that was best in his culture\nand applied this knowledge in public forums (\u2026)\u201d (1994: 331). The existence, of such a\ncultural ideal, suggested a worldview in which \u201cvalues are coherent and the wisdom of public\ncan be fully mastered by one man\u201d (1994: 331). Classical rhetoric was informed by a world of\nthe acting community which, clearly, was changed, mostly in the sense of coherence and\neminence. As the original sociocultural-political context of rhetoric was being reconfigured,\nthe discipline had to overcome several existentially critical phases. However, there were two\neras of rejection which turned out to be almost fatal.\nAccording to Bender and Wellbery\u2019s (1990) seminal article, both the Enlightenment and\nRomanticism caused this rejection of rhetoric. From the former\u2019s perspective, rhetoric seemed\nempty, blurred, and diffuse. Public discourse had to be freed of its individual interests;\ndeprived of rhetorical ambiguity, and magniloquence and passion. For Romanticism, rhetoric\nhad become a craft rather than the faculty of the genius, a way of producing rather than\ncreating. These two sets of attacks resulted in the rejection of rhetoric\u2019s classical tradition for\nthe following reasons: ascendant scientific objectivity with values of transparency and\nneutrality; a new emphasis on individual originality and authorship; liberalism\u2019s displacement\nof republicanism in political theory; the dominance of literacy over orality; and the rise of the\nvernacular language nation state. With the recession of this rejection, rhetoric managed to\nregain its significance. This shift was caused by those phenomena which characterized\nmodern, postmodern scientific thinking, and global communicative culture. With the advent\nof new media technologies, a lingua franca, of influential communication, was reclaimed.\n387 New spaces of democratic debating called for a global language through which\nepistemological pluralism and individual voices were manifested.\nThrough the capacity to relieve scientific and moral paradoxes of postmodern societies, to\nperform playfulness in communication, and to fulfil global communicative exigencies and\nobjectives, rhetoric managed to retrieve its practical and theoretical status amongst disciplines\nof discourse and returned (again) to the contemporary cultural and scientific landscape.\n2. Rhetoric\nAs Aristotle put it, rhetoric, is \u201cthe faculty of observing in any given case the available\nmeans of persuasion\u201d (1355b). Debated as a science, it was defined as being either a faculty\nor a virtue referred to mainly as art. However, its verbal persuasive function was accepted\nwidely and, with a growing rational suspicion, it was labelled agonistic. In the meanwhile, its\nreduction, to the techniques of elocution, led to the pejorative use of the term rhetoric. In\norder to escape the inhibiting limitation of rhetoric to the study of persuasive speech and to\nlessen the democratic fears, towards its subjectivity and influential nature, modernist and\npostmodernist copings with rhetoric (see the works of Kenneth Duva Burke; Ch\u00e4im Perelman;\nIvor A. Richards; Henry Johnstone Jr.; and Colling G. Brooke) sought new horizons to\ninterpret rhetoric in a more integrative way. Thereby, rhetoric was legitimized to function as a\ndimension of communication and its meta-representations.\nRhetoric\u2019s scope was widened to provide a framework of all symbolic, societal and\nmediated functions. Reboul (1991) pointed to the broadening of modern rhetoric by\nemphasizing its expansion from the verbal to the visual; and from the conscious to the non-\nconscious. In designating new directions for rhetoric in everyday life, Nystrand and Duffy\n(2003: ix), assumed that rhetoric ought not to refer to \u201cthe classical arts of persuasion, or the\nverbal ornamentation of elite discourse, but rather to the ways that individuals and groups use\n388 language to constitute their social realities (\u2026). The discourses, of institutions and popular\nculture, are rhetorical in the sense that they situate us in our worlds: they shape our ideas\nabout the \u2018way things are\u2019 who we are; where we belong; and guide what we talk about and\nwhat we say (and don\u2019t say).\u201d Worldwide discussions, of rhetoric, (Burke, 1950, Grassi, 1980,\nCorder, 1985, Hauser 1999, Johnstone, 2007, Skari\u010d, 2007, Mifsud, 2007, Acz\u00e9l, 2012)\nrediscovered those capacities, of rhetoric, which proved that the classical discipline had more\nto offer than a set of persuasive techniques; a pack of discursive tricks; and disciplined genres\nof mono-logic discourse.\n3. Rhetoric and New Media\nFrom the turn of the 21st century, rhetorical theory has been challenged strongly by the\ncomplex system and phenomena of new media. A communicative culture is being formulated\nwhose currency is information and which is characterized by permanent connection, publicity,\nand participation. Information and information technologies have created \u2013 as theorists claim\n\u2013 the attention economy (Goldhaber, 1997, Davenport\u2013Beck, 2001) in which \u201cthe wealth of\ninformation means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever is that information\nconsumes\u201d (Simon 1971: 40). It is the human attention which communication and\ninformation strive to grasp and compete for. This attention economy operates through\n\u201ccognitive capitalism\u201d (Crogan and Kinsley, 2012: 3) and is the natural economy of media-\nspace (Goldhaber, 1997). Although the attention economy paradigm is being debated with\nperspectives over a new vision of the location economy, whereby one\u2019s location is the scarce\nresource on which new media applications are built, it determines our everyday discursive\npractices when we produce, create, and consume (\u2018cresume\u2019 or \u2018presume\u2019).\nWhen consuming texts, we screen, scan, and browse and try to be energy-conscious with\nour attention (Johnson, 2012). Messages are produced to become noticed. Therefore, they\n389 endeavour to eliminate this consciousness and to catch and gain attention. The norms, of\nmessage formation, were changed in accordance with the challenges of the attention economy.\nWriting little, using micro-style, breaking the rules, and evoking conversation are those\nprinciples which seem to rule our communicative culture. Participating in new media spaces\nneeds new competencies and literacies (Hoechsmann\u2013Poyntz, 2012) in order to be conscious,\ncreative, and communicative concerning convergent media usage.\nOriginally, European rhetoric was worked out for the discursive practices of the public\nspaces of the polis where people met, shared ideas, and influenced each other strategically in\nthe traditional one-to-many relationships. The textual ideal of rhetoric used to be the \u2018finished\nand polished\u2019 speech, the formal act of discourse with which someone persuaded many others\nby means of structure, common places, figures of speech, and argumentation. Formal oratory\nwas a conservative force preserving the moral and political values, of the past; its function\nwas to preserve things as they were. Traditional rhetoric prepared the speaker for winning\nwith words: winning the receiver\u2019s soul and will. Offering the canon, rhetoric enabled the\nspeaker to invent topics, arrange them hierarchically into structural units, to express them in\nlanguage, and remember texts and perform speeches. The rhetorical model, of this tradition, is\nthat of the well-educated man who is trained to express, in one speech, the common wisdom\nof his society. Consequently, rhetoric is to be about the excellence of the speaker, and about\nthe formality of the situation and the speech. However, new media widened and replaced real\npublic spaces and fluidized texts. The operation and usage, of new media, blurs the border\nbetween the roles of the speaker and audience; remediates discourse (visual and verbal)\nconstantly and accustoms users to the infiniteness of messages. New media should be\nconsidered to be the complex of new textual experiences; new ways of representation, new\nimpressions and experiences of embodiment, new relations between user and technology, new\nways of expression (verbal, visual, multimedia), new patterns of organizations, production\n390 and control, and new realizations of identity and social relations (Lister, 2003, Fuery, 2009,\nMiller 2011). \u2018New media\u2019 is a convergent notion of convergent and digital media\ntechnologies consisting of the computer, the internet, the mobile phone, social media, digital\ntelevision, and so on. In media-lingo, new media\u2019s most frequently used characteristics are\ndigital, interactive, hyper-textual, and virtual. Digital as it is, rhetoric, of the new media\u2019s\ndiscursive practice , was called, also, digital rhetoric.\nKathleen Welch argued (1999: 104) that electric rhetoric is \u201can emergent consciousness or\nmentalit\u00e9 within discourse communities, is the new merger of the written and the oral, both\nnow newly empowered and reconstructed by electricity and both dependent on print literacy.\nElectronic technologies have led to electronic consciousness, an awareness or mentalit\u00e9 that\nnow changes literacy but in no way diminishes it.\u201d Screen generations, with that\nconsciousness, form new codes of interactions and interfaces mark new common ways of\ngetting into contact. A new (virtual) subjectivity and inter-subjectivity67 emerges. Rhetoric is\ngaining new characteristics which feature mediated text production and non-linear\nconsumption.\nFirstly, there is no clear border between the speaker and the audience; the continuous\nexchanging of roles enables the person to be both speaker and listener, to be both writer and\nreader; and, in the same rhetorical situation, to be, concurrently, both communicator and\nreceiver. In the public domain, texts are not objects; by representing, talking, and constituting\nrelationships, they are themselves, public. This means not only that the speaker is acting\nconstantly as an audience but, also, that the result, of that simultaneous, multi-identical\ncommunication, is the interaction within and with texts. Interactivity penetrated the rhetorical\n67 \u201cComputer screen and television screen coexist as centers of familial activity. In this kind of private space, the\nhousehold member can delve into the computer screen by visiting websites, by associatively surfing locations ,\nby shopping, by entering a synchronous chat room or MUD (a multi-user domain, in which the digitally literate\nperson can assume various personae), by reading and/or posting to an asynchronous list serve (or by reading\nonly, a move that has been named \"lurking\"), and by many other activities with CD-ROMs. Many people have\nreported the experience in their digital households and HUTs (or their offices or cyberhall cafes) of subjectively\ngoing elsewhere on the computer, of interacting subjectively with the machine in a way that increases and/or\ncomplicates human interaction with technology.\u201d (Welch, 1999: 156)\n391 situation, the role of the sender and the text which is open to modification, being un-finished,\nfluid, and trans-medial. New media discourse suggests informality, a characteristic which is\nunfamiliar with traditional rhetorical practices. As Judith T. Irvine (1979: 776-779) suggested,\nformality is due to increased code structuring, the consistency of choices, and the invocation,\nof the positional, rather than the personal identities and the emergence of a central situational\nfocus. Formal speech and communication imposes special rules of style and delivery on the\nspeaker and deals with important activities and central figures in them (Kennedy, 1997).\nHowever, the interactivity and permanence, of new media communication, stir up the\nsituational borders of formality, lessen the importance of rules and positions, and boost the\nsignificance of personal identities and side involvements.\nNew media\u2019s basic characteristics changed, also, the way ethos, pathos and logos could\noperate. As Gurak (2009) claimed, speed \u2013 combined with reach \u2013 was a predominant feature\nwhich had a dramatic impact on the content and practice of communication. A significant\nshift, from invention to delivery (distribution), can be detected in digital practice. Speed\nenhances the need to distribute on the speaker\u2019s side and the desire to find on the consumer\u2019s\nside. The register has become blended, and communication is more repetitive and redundant.\nNow, the intention, to persuade specific audiences, is less important than the ability to reach\nmany audiences. In connection with the changes, the traditional one-to-many configuration\nwas modified into many-to-many relationships to enable users to have a democratic reach.\nMultiple identities, formed by the possibilities and spaces of the digital environment,\nde/reformed the digital speaker\u2019s ethos. Anonymity evokes not only tendencies like masking,\nflaming, and contingency but, also, altruism in communication. The logic (and arrangement),\nof texts, is different, also, from that of the traditional canon and of the culture of print. In\nhypermedia, the cause-effect logic was replaced by an associational one. In parallel,\nprocessing substitutes were serial processing, linear-indexical thinking, and changes to\n392 network-associational. In electrical rhetoric, the process replaces the product,,consequently,\nthe speaker creates an information environment in which the user chooses the line or path.\nDigital rhetoric testifies that, with the advent of new media, new modes of rhetorical\noperations have to be implemented. Nevertheless, it draws attention mainly to the changes\nwith which rhetoric has to cope and does not focus on the very rhetorical nature of new media.\nWith the rediscovery of the spatial, visual, procedural and aural nature of rhetoric, an original\nconnection can be detected between rhetoric and new media and, therefore, the \u2018challenges of\nbytes and likes\u2019 are answered. Although they provide rhetoric with a (new) media perspective,\nthe spatial, visual, procedural and aural dimensions, of the rhetorical discipline, have been\nshadowed for a long time. The following sections cast light on these domains in order to\nintroduce an integrative redefinition of rhetoric.\n4. Visual Rhetoric\nUntil the 1970\u2019s, rhetoric was conceived almost solely as the study of verbal discourse.\nThe spirited inquiry, into the rhetorical study of images, started with scholars such as Kenneth\nBurke (1950) or Douglas Ehninger (1972) whose definitions, of rhetoric, did not privilege\nverbal symbols and which were sufficiently broad to include the visual. They considered\nrhetoric to be the use and study of symbols and addressed symbolically not as exclusively\nverbal. Through these approaches, a deeper understanding, of the influences and operations of\nthe rhetorical object (product), could be developed. Had the natural affinity, between the\nvisual image and rhetoric, not been discovered, the process of the expansion of rhetoric to\nencompass the visual, could have been disrupted easily and stopped by the \u201cvociferous\nobjections\u201d (Foss, 2005: 142) of language-centred interpretations. Current definitions of the\ndiscipline tend to support the development of visual rhetoric; this suggests an easier fit\nbetween the visual and the rhetorical.\n393 Visual rhetoric, as a subdomain of the classical discipline, endeavoured to purport\nrhetorical literacy, for the visual, and to provide a framework to interpret and produce visual\nartefacts rhetorically. In rhetoric, the visual perspective indicated, also, the emerging\nrecognition of the significance of images in human understanding, discursive practices, and\nmedia communication. On defining visual rhetoric, scholars distinguished between at least\ntwo meanings. One conceptualized visual rhetoric as a communicative artefact, a product,\nmade of images and visual symbols (analogously to a speech), whilst the other understood it\nto be an analytical tool with which the creation and performing of communication, by visual\nsymbols, could be examined (Foss, 2004). Although this dualistic view of visual rhetoric\nreflects rhetoric as a practice and rhetoric as a theory, it is not sensitive enough to the possible\ntripartite division of rhetoric. This assumes that rhetoric is either a product (a multimodal\n\u2018speech\u2019), a procedure (mechanism), or a process (communication). Following the latter\ndivision, we conceive visual rhetoric either as a product to address public, a persuasive, visual\nrepresentation, or a procedure, logic to experience and to see and form pictures, images, or a\nprocess with which we interpret the world around us (Ott-Dickinson, 2009).\nAs a product, visual rhetoric is the counterpart of verbal rhetoric, namely, the rhetoric of\npersuasive speeches. To put it simply, we replace the verbal with the visual and apply the\nstrategies of rhetoric to produce and analyse persuasive, influential messages. Commercials,\ncampaign spots, and billboard pictures are the kind of visual, or visual-verbal messages which\naddress the public and are structured rhetorically in order to achieve the planned reaction.\nHowever, this functional refiguring of the classical discipline and its adaptation to the visual\ndomain, is not without obstacles. Traditionally, rhetoric, used for verbal interactions, feels\nnon-socialized within the field of images when it comes to the analysis of their persuasive\npower. Forcing the terminology once worked out for speech to function satisfactorily with the\nvisual, scholars have to face the organic difference between the constitutive nature of words\n394 and pictures. Nevertheless, in the context of vigorous debates about visual argument and\npersuasion this functional view preserved its legitimacy to regard pictures and moving images\nas rhetorical products.\nIn the second view, visual rhetoric is a process and it facilitates the perspective of those\n\u2018non-traditional\u2019 theorists68 of rhetoric who state that there is a shift from rhetoric as product\n(and composition) to rhetoric as a process, and call it the rhetoric of everyday life. By this\nthey primarily mean the \u201crhetorical character and dynamics of language in mundane contexts\u201d\n(Nystrand\u2013Duffy, 2003: viii); the realization, of which leads to the identification of the\nrhetorical character of literacy development, which shapes the location and meaning of\neveryday life. Albeit in terms of language, this view differentiates rhetoric as a process\nclearly from rhetoric as a product. However, we integrate images into this paradigm by\nstating that, as a process, visual rhetoric means the rhetorical character and dynamics of\nimages in the contexts of everyday life. As a process, visual rhetoric is a vision of culture, a\nconstitutive interaction between culture and subjectivity, and a continuous enactment of their\nmultiple relationships. Here, visualizing is considered to be the grounding for reality, a\ncontainer of memory, a dimension of everyday existence by which we refract continuously\nand rhetorically our understanding of the world and ourselves within it. In this sense,\nvisualizing does not represent, but creates experience by relating, through images, the person\nto the concrete situation. It is more a constitutive part of subjectivity, identity, and culture\nthan an effect of the eye. It is contextual, spatial, and material (Ott\u2013Dickinson, 2009: 396-\n398). Flickr and YouTube photos, shared on Facebook, are characteristic examples, of this\nvisualizing, and of the visual rhetoric as the process of everyday life. As a process, visual\nrhetoric provides a perspective of media communication, which reflects both image-reading\n68 Non-traditional rhetoricians focus on those rhetorical practices which are not mainstream in the sense of social\npower and its rhetorical character. They are researchers investigating those capacities of rhetoric which have\nlong been forgotten or re-declared as belonging to other faculties of discourse studies; please see, for example,\nCarolyn R. Miller\u2019s or John Ackerman\u2019s writings on genre or space.\n395 and reshaping, and which develops complex visual competencies within the constituted social\nworld.\nThe approach of visual rhetoric as a procedure suggests that images are underlying forms\nof our thinking and that the pictures are created as a visual mode comprising visual logic and\nintelligence. As a procedure, visual rhetoric is about the logic of seeing and about visual\nthinking as a procedure of rhetorical practices. In this view, procedure is conceived as the\nlogic of constitution and deconstruction. Visual logic is based on studies of perception and\ncognition to which Rudolf Arnheim\u2019s seminal contribution (1969) was determinative.\nCognitive scientists agreed that seeing was creative; it was selective; spatial; and contextual.\nCreative means that seeing is a subjective way of reconstruction affected by personal beliefs\nand cultural contexts. Seeing is more of a production governed by aesthetic factors of images\n(e.g. light; form; texture) than consumption. Seeing is selective because of the zooming\napplication of our glances; gazes; and looks. Therefore, we select image-parts and filter out\nothers depending on inner needs and outer factors. Whilst linguistic signs are temporal, visual\nsigns are arranged spatially; this allows the viewer to perceive several images simultaneously\nin a single place. Then, seeing is spatial and visual logic occupies space. Finally, seeing is\ncontextual since it is connected to the cultural, historical context of observation entailing\nvalues and ideologies of the concrete situation. We add that seeing is, also, figurative since it\nis the resource and the reinforcement of conceptual metaphors and the regulator of the\nrhetorical figures and their envisioning. As a procedure, visual rhetoric provides rhetoric with\nthe literacy of seeing and concurrent cognition: this is what the production or presumption of\nmedia-messages calls for.\n396 5. Spatial Rhetoric\nIn the shadows of the visual or iconic turn, a spatial turn occurs, also. This turn marks the\nfruitful weaving together of the concept of space, place, location, and milieu. Spaces, as\nproduced interactively, places as lived inter-relatedly, and newly opened cultural spaces and\nplaces, are amongst those key ideas which determine scientific thinking about space practices\nand representations of space. These are the ones which reveal the communicative and\nrhetorical horizon of space and place.\nNevertheless, in rhetorical discussions, space emerges still as a partly enigmatic and often\nvague notion with malleable definitions. Although spatial rhetoric is an accepted term to name\ncompositional practices which represent place-experiences, by using two basic presumptions,\nthe present apprehension, of spatial rhetoric, introduces a broader interpretation. The first is\nthat rhetoric is the creator of cultural space; the second is that rhetorical speeches are built on\nvisual and spatial imagery. Following the idea of third space (Bhabha, 1994, Soja, 2009),\nnamely, a place where culture is displaced from the interactions and, therefore, a hybrid,\ncommon identity is created to enter a dialogue and share place and space, the researcher\nproposes that rhetorical communication opens a psycho-geographical location for the\ninteractions and offers a discursive place in the context of a spatial experience. Rhetoric forms\nthe \"constantly shifting and changing milieu of ideas, events, appearances, and meanings\"\n(Soja, 1996: 2); a third space is a reflective space from which the actual and practical cultural\nplace can be seen.\nIf we revisit its disciplinary history, rhetoric\u2019s spatial capacity is unquestionable. The main\naim of the establishment of rhetoric was to form the building elements and rules which inhabit\nand govern an autonomous discursive sphere apart from \u2013 or authentically connected to \u2013\nreality. In oral communication rhetoric was also a container (Esposito, 2002) where traces of\npast experiences were stored and exposed on certain occasions. As the architect of culture,\n397 rhetoric provided communities and societies with spaces of discourse; this could not be done\nwithout spatial logic and intelligence in message construction.\nSpatial intelligence, one of Howard Gardner\u2019s multiple intelligences (1993), concerns the\nability of thinking in three dimensions: having mental imagery, graphic skills, and the\ncapacity to reason spatially and imagine actively. From this, it is obvious that spatial\nintelligence is related closely to visual intelligence and visual, hyper-textual new media.\nHowever, the intelligence for space also includes abilities for less concrete impressions\nincluding skills for the abstract, for the schematic, and for the mapped. Although visualizing\ngoverns spatial practices, in order to be understood and answered, space has its specific\nrequirements. Conceiving and analysing an argument is less a visual than a spatial experience\neven if exploited in pictures or images, as Venn-diagrams with the overlapping circles may\nprove. Spatial capacities add dimensions to the visual and develop structural hierarchy,\nreasoning, and hyper-textual consumption skills.\nAncient speakers used their spatial intelligence effectively in remembering their speeches.\nThey were architects of their ideas, imagining them either in buildings or in streets, and they\nwere landlords of that building to which the audience was invited to visit. The imaginative is\nmemorable; in classical rhetoric, the art of memory highlights the way rhetoric performers\nrecoded their speeches in pictures, in spaces, and in mental sites from where words and ideas\ncould be recalled. With the urge to remember, they worked out the text\u2019s spatial experience,\nenriched by visual impressions. Hence, the rhetorical text was recomposed visually and\nspatially to convey, in a persuasive way, meanings, symbols, and ideas. The discursive sphere\nwas created by a visual-spatial thinking about and of words and relationships. Therefore, the\nresearcher claims that rhetorical \u201ctexts\u201d are messages which have visual and spatial\ncharacteristics and they recreate images and spaces. Spatial rhetoric enriches media\nproduction and analysis with the awareness of space and the figures and practices of place-\n398 forming. In media, rhetorical penetration helps the realization of new media texts and\nmessages as objects and events in the real and intellectual space and supports the development\nof spatially sensitive (multi)media literacy. Hyperlinked texts exploit spatial logic and operate\nwith visual force \u2013 namely, what spatial rhetoric can contribute relevantly to in description\nand interpretation.\n6. Procedural Rhetoric\nIn his work on persuasive (digital) games, Ian Bogost introduced a new term of rhetoric\nsuggesting:\nthe name of procedural rhetoric for the new type of persuasive and expressive practice at\nwork (\u2026). Procedurality refers to a way of creating, explaining, or understanding\nprocesses. And processes define the way things work: the methods, techniques, and logics\nthat drive the operation of systems, from mechanical systems like engines to organizational\nsystems like high schools to conceptual systems like religious faith. (\u2026) Procedural\nrhetoric, then, is a practice of using processes persuasively. More specifically, procedural\nrhetoric is the practice of persuading through processes in general and computational\nprocesses in particular. (\u2026) Procedural rhetoric is a technique for making arguments with\ncomputational systems and for unpacking computational arguments others have created.\n(2010: 2-3)\nProcedural rhetoric is built on procedural logic which has its roots in both graphical\n(depiction of movement, lighting, rhythm of change, collision, etc.) and textual (selection,\ncombination, sequencing) operations. It is fed, also, by operational models and their common\npatterns of media usage and interaction (menu; toolbar). Hence, procedural rhetoric uses\nfigures of operational, textual and graphic thinking in order to form ideas and draw\nconclusions out of processes. However, as Bogost emphasized, procedural representations\n399 differ from textual, visual and plastic representations. They depict how codes regulate through\nhardware and software systems.\nAlthough these representations may lead us further from the complex communicative and\nrhetorical phenomena of new media, procedural rhetoric may reveal how media message\nprogramming and program coding is inherently rhetorical. Procedural rhetoric is an\ninvigorating dimension of the classical discipline, in the sense that it connects interface\nstrategies with systemic ones and highlights the argumentative capacity of rules and\nregulations. La Molleindustria\u2019s online games exemplify argumentative procedural rhetoric\nin a spectacular way. As it is announced on the homepage: \u201cOur objective is to investigate the\npersuasive potentials of the medium by subverting mainstream video gaming clich\u00e8 (and\npossibly have fun in the process).\u201d69. Games, such as the Phone story, lead the player to\nthe \u201ddark side\u201d of consumers\u2019 society, for example, the smart phones, forcing them to realize\nthe consequences of only drawing on the process\u2019 rules and regulations. Consequently,\nprocedural rhetoric helps to reveal the meaning of system operations and their cultural\npatterns. Then, in using toolbars and software and logic, there is the switching on and off\nrhetoric. Therefore, media rhetoric is supported by a capacity with which systemic,\noperational and graphical coding can be unveiled and elaborated.\nProcedural rhetoric can function as the literacy of system-operations and argumentations,\nwhich expands visual literacy. More of a rediscovery than an innovation, it identifies\npredominant characteristics of new media technologies and, consequently, is to be taken into\nconsideration in understanding, interpreting, and producing new media messages.\n69 www.molleindustria.org\n400 7. Aural Rhetoric\nWhilst the branch of visual rhetoric was struggling with the 2500-years-long disciplinary\ndetermination and domination of the verbal, aural rhetoric was strangled into almost total\nsilence and scholarly neglect. Aural discussions are omitted practically from contemporary\nrhetorical theory; rhetoric\u2019s aural dimension seems to be forgotten or unheard.\nNevertheless, sonority, as a symbolic activity, used to be an inherent part of the rhetorical\nspeech. In the classical rhetorical tradition, voicing was discussed with the last rhetorical\ncanon of speech (delivery). However, in the first place, there were some treatises which dealt\nwith it and suggested that the aural was prior to the textual, determining structural;and\naesthetic verbal features. In rhetorical performance, the oral/aural mingled with the visual: the\nspeaker\u2019s appearance, body postures, and gestures. Aristotle (1403b) said that delivery was\n\u201ca matter of the right management of the voice to express the various emotions-of speaking\nloudly, softly, or between the two; of high, low, or intermediate pitch; of the various rhythms\nthat suit various subjects. These are the three things - volume of sound, modulation of pitch,\nand rhythm-that a speaker bears in mind.\u201d The rhetorical speech used to be considered as the\norchestration of a text serving semantic and pragmatic aims, supporting the speaker\u2019s\ncredibility. Even in later centuries, \u201caccento rhetorico\u201d was considered to be the highest virtue\nof the performer, placed above the \u201caccento grammatico\u201d which had no sensitivity to the\ntotality of the rhetorical communication.\nAlthough sound was considered to be of great importance, aural rhetoric has remained a\nless discussed aspect of understanding; interpreting and producing (new) media messages.\nScott Halbritter (2004: 225) assumed that it was overlooked by media theorists for the\nfollowing reasons: \u201c1. our visually oriented terminology has screened out terminology for\nrealizing the aural, 2. the information aural tools support appears, when successfully\ncomposed, to be subordinate to the visual information with which it is contextualized. 3. We\n401 have not traditionally established, nor recognized legitimate aurally rhetorical ends for the\nconventional forms of academic compositions.\u201d\nNeglected as it is, aural rhetoric does not cease to offer an enriched view of new media\nargumentation and persuasion. It highlights the aural dimension of a media-message as a\nrhetorical activity. Whilst audio branding (sonic branding; acoustic branding) has gained\nconsiderable significance in the field of marketing communication \u2013 recognizing and\nrevealing the role of sound, melody, and noise in making the message persuasive and\nmemorable \u2013 the need for aural literacy; \u2018auralacy\u2019 is only now awakening. Whilst, within\nnew media, for a long time, the internet was considered to be silent or mute, we are also\nmoving in the context of soundscapes. It is aural rhetoric which can provide consumers with\nliteracy and competence to understand, interpret, and represent meaningful sound-constructs.\nHence, aural rhetoric can be apprehended in three ways:\n- As the strategic formation of sounding structures in the multi-media message. Here,\nwe consider aural rhetoric as a product, the functions, of which, can be categorized as\naural genres.\n- As a critical tool to interpret how the aural is related to the visual and verbal. How it\nconstitutes the context of drawing conclusions and what meanings it generates. It is\nthe phenomenological apprehension, of aural rhetoric, to focus on the reality it creates\nand the signifying processes by which it operates.\n- As an interpretive method to report on what are our culturally patterned soundscapes\nand how they are imposed on us by media (image) events.\nAural rhetoric, conceptualized as either a formation or a method, is best considered the\nspecial capacity of new media rhetoric, or integrates with the complex visual literacy which\nmedia requires. It \u2018vocalizes\u2019 procedural new media spaces in which sounds contextualize\n402 images and images imbricate aural experience, offering sound arguments to both rhetorical\nand new media theory.\nEpilogue in Lieu of Conclusions\nThis theoretical essay pursued the unveiling of those perspectives of rhetoric which its\nmost common definitions suppressed for a long time. It sought, also, new dimensions of new\nmedia understanding through the consideration of visual, spatial, procedural and aural\nrhetorics. Notwithstanding its age, the ancient faculty is invigorated and capable of being\napplied to new media events. This approach, comprising visual, spatial, procedural and aural\nsubdomains beside the verbal, strove to prove that rhetoric was more complex than thought of\ngenerally. By these dimensions, rhetoric can be seen no longer as alienated from discursive\npractices of digital and interactive new media. On the contrary, a natural resonance is\nmanifest. Therefore, rhetoric answers the challenge of bytes and likes with its readiness to be\nredefined as the condition of multi-media existence and as the theory and practice of new\nmedia discourse.\nAlthough much remains to be considered, elaborating on the rhetoric of images, spaces,\nprocedures and sounds deepens our general and specific understanding of both the classical\ndiscipline and new media phenomena.\nReferences\nAcz\u00e9l, P. \u201cMediarhetoric: Complex Visual Literacy.\u201d Edited by A.

Previous research concerning Croatian newspapers (Ivas, 2004; Runji\u0107-Stoilova, 2012) showed that\nantonomasia is also a very frequent trope both in the headlines and in the body of journal articles. The aim of our\nresearch was to further explore types of antonomasia in the sports news sub-style. The corpus consisted of three\ngroups of sports news: (1) sports news articles in daily newspapers; (2) articles in specialized sports newspapers\nand magazines; (3) the prime-time sports news in the daily news program of the three Croatian national networks\n(HRT, Nova TV and RTL).\nThree conclusions can be drawn from the analysis: (1) sports antonomasias mostly substitute names of\nathletes, sports clubs and national selections; (2) metonymic-based antonomasias are most frequently used; (3)\njournalists tend to use antonomasia more frequently in written articles than in television news.\nKey words: antonomasia, metaphor, metonymy, rhetoric, sports discourse\n1. Introduction\nThere is no spoken or written discourse which is purely literal. Following this maxim,\nthree equally mindful scholars \u2013 the rhetorician, the stylistician and the linguist \u2013 could look\nup figures of speech in any discourse. Upon close scrutiny, none of them would fail to find at\nleast one figure of speech even in the simplest form of discourse. But from this point forward\ntheir research would go in different directions. The linguist would treat all figures equally\n(because they are all language products); the stylistician would be interested only in observing\nthe intentionally produced figures (since only striking or \"deviant\" features of discourse are\nthose which have stylistic \"value\"); the classical rhetorician, on the other hand, would be\ninterested in analyzing which figures (regardless of their origin) had (or could have) the\n408 strongest effect on the target audience. All of those researchers could concentrate on one\nfigure only, or they could analyze a whole group of figures.\nThe authors of this paper are rhetoricians and their research concentrated on one figure\n(more precisely, a trope) in one type of discourse. The trope is that of antonomasia which was\ntested on the \"battlefield\" of sports discourse. Aware of the specific problems of their\n\"favorite\", the authors tried to avail themselves of linguistics (especially onomastics and\ncognitive linguistics), stylistics as well as cultural theory.\n1.1 Between metaphor and metonymy\nAntonomasia is a trope which has two functions. The first one is a substitution of a\nproper name by an appellative, epithet or periphrasis (e.g. the Philosopher for Aristotle, Our\nBeautiful for Croatia or the Queen of Pop for Madonna). This type is called classical or proper\nantonomasia because it was defined in this sense in the classical handbooks of rhetoric (see\nAnderson, 2000; Quintilian, 1959). The second function is a substitution of a certain trait by a\nproper name which has become synonymous with a specific trait (Schumacher for \"a fast\ndriver\", Penelope for \"a faithful wife\" or Mozart for \"an exceptional one, a virtuoso\"). This\ntype is called Vossian antonomasia, after Gerardus Johannis Vossius, 17th century Dutch\nrhetorician who first described the second function (Lausberg, 1990).70\nDefined in the broader sense, antonomasia can be regarded as a trope that relies on the\nprocesses of appellativization and deappellativization, both common in everyday language\n(Van Langendonck, 2007). In the classical type of antonomasia, appellative words are treated\nas proper ones: they are usually written in capital letters and they are never used alongside the\nname which they substitute. In stark contrast to this, Vossian antonomasia treats proper names\nas if they were common nouns. This is the reason why sometimes the figurative use of a\n70 For those interested in more detailed discussion on different definitions of antonomasia and the distinction\nbetween two types, look in Grgi\u0107 and Nikoli\u0107, 2011a, 2011b.\n409 proper name becomes necessary in naming a certain object or process (e.g. the word \"boycott\"\noriginates from the English Captain Charles Boycott, who was socially ostracized by his local\ncommunity in Ireland; the word \"pasteurization\" is derived from the inventor of this chemical\nprocess, Louis Pasteur; the flower \"dahlia\" can be traced to the Swedish botanist Anders Dahl\netc.). In all of these cases antonomasias transformed to catachreses which are classified as\neponyms in linguistics.\nThere has been a strong tradition of reducing tropes to only four major ones \u2013\nmetaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony (Burke, 1969). In this tradition antonomasia is\nseen as a part of metonymy or synecdoche (see Lausberg, 1990; Monson, 2003).71 The\nstructuralist view on tropes is often simplified through Jakobson\u2019s discussion about\nmetaphoric/paradigmatic and metonymic/syntagmatic relations (Nerlich, 2005), but the\nsimilar dichotomic principle can be traced through the works of cognitive linguists (who are\noften deemed opposed to linguistic structuralism). If they ever discuss antonomasia as an\nindependent linguistic entity, they are mostly concerned with the classical form which can\neasily be interpreted as metonymy. The Vossian type is rejected as a special form of\nantonomasia and it is simply described as a metaphor (Brdar and Brdar-Szab\u00f3, 2001). Other\nauthors close to the cognitive linguistic view describe the classical type as metonymic as\nopposed to the metaphoric Vossian type (Holmqvist & Pluciennik, 2010).\nAlthough this strict binary classification seems valid, there are many examples of\nantonomasia which can be described as a combination of metaphor and metonymy (e.g. the\nSwiss Wizard for Roger Federer, the Giant from \u0160alata for Ivo Karlovi\u0107, the basketball\nMozart for Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107, the Croatian Ibiza for the Zr\u0107e beach on the island of Pag etc.).\nAll of these examples are phrases, consisting of two parts: head and dependent. Head is in\nmost cases a common or proper noun (e.g. wizard, giant, Mozart, Ibiza) and dependent is\n71 This view could be accepted if we disregard the existence of the second, Vossian type of antonomasia. Since\nthe followers of this approach defined antonomasia only in its classical form, they could easily classify it simply\neither as metonymy or synecdoche.\n410 usually an adjective (e.g. Swiss, basketball, Croatian) or a prepositional phrase containing a\nnoun (e.g. from \u0160alata). The head part is always some type of trope (usually a metaphor)\nwhich all by itself already constitutes antonomasia, but in order to be properly and\nunambiguously understood it requires a non-figurative dependent part. For example, naming\nIvica Kosteli\u0107 King or his sister Janica Queen could be easily confused with the same\nfigurative substitution for Usain Bolt or Madonna, respectively. Therefore, if we want\nantonomasia to be specific and unambiguous, we must add some kind of dependent which\nwill have a strict literal meaning such as snow, of athletics or of pop.\nIt is important to note that this combination is not some third possible type of\nantonomasia. All of these examples are classical antonomasias (they substitute proper names),\nbut the head part of the phrase is not metonymic and this feature distinguishes them from\ntypical examples of the classical type. Furthermore, this combined type often contains proper\nnames which are again sometimes used metonymically and sometimes metaphorically.\nExamples like the Swiss Wizzard or the Giant from \u0160alata contain proper names in the\ndependent part which impart the metonymic \"truth\" to their metaphoric head parts.\nConversely, when the head part contains a proper name (the basketball Mozart, the\nCroatian Ibiza), things get even more complex because the head part already constitutes\nVossian antonomasia.72 As it is the case with all other \"simple\" Vossian antonomasias, the\nproper name is reduced to one specific meaning while other connotations or alternate\nmeanings are disregarded. An identical process occurs when common nouns are used\nmetaphorically (Markovi\u0107, 2010), so this could be taken as an additional argument for\ndenying the recogniton of antonomasia. However, this argument only shows that the\nprocesses behind the creation of Vossian antonomasia are basically metaphoric. Antonomasia,\nnevertheless, must be treated as a separate trope because it always involves a proper name\n72 This subtype could be described as Vossian antonomasia inside the classical one. News style frequently uses\nthis kind of antonomasia because the Vossian element has strong connotations for a specific audience (e. g. the\nSwitzerland of Latin America for Uruguay or the Venice of the North for several European cities).\n411 which is always treated as a specific linguistic feature (Markovi\u0107, 2010; Van Langendonck,\n2007).\n1.2 Sports discourse and antonomasia\nIn order to understand the use of antonomasia in sports discourse, it is necessary to\npoint out its figurative characteristics. Sports discourse can be defined as the subtype of news\n(or journalistic) style. This general style frequently uses tropes (especially metaphor and\nmetonymy), and the sports news sub-style sometimes seems to be nothing but tropical. One of\nthe reasons for using figures and tropes in the type of discourse whose primary function is\ninforming may be found in the need to have an emotional impact on the recipient (Runji\u0107-\nStoilova, 2012).\nAntonomasia is used in sports discourse mostly in its first function \u2013 it substitutes the\nnames of athletes, clubs, national teams, as well as coaches, sports arenas etc. The relatively\nfrequent use of antonomasia in sports discourse can certainly be ascribed to the specific\n\"problem\" of sports news: the same names are very often repeated in the same text. To avoid\nmonotony, journalists substitute them with contextual periphrases such as the Club from Split,\nWenger\u2019s players, the world\u2019s best player or they rely on the established antonomasia or\n\"nickname\", as it is usually called in everyday language. On the other hand, there is some\nkind of general agreement that the high frequency of stereotypical expressions (so called\n\"journalisms\") is a negative characteristic of news style. Some authors, nevertheless, find it\nvery functional because this automated use of expressions helps the recipients in better\nunderstanding the message (Runji\u0107-Stoilova, 2012).\nIn the previous section we tried to establish the connection between antonomasia and\nboth metonymy and metaphor (not strictly through the classical/Vossian antonomasia\ndichotomy) and in further analysis we will observe the sports antonomasias through the\n412 concepts of source and target domain. This methodology was adopted from cognitive\nlinguistics, which approaches metaphor and metonymy in a different manner than classical\nrhetoric and stylistics. Cognitive linguistics treats metaphor and metonymy not as figures of\nspeech (ornaments in language) but as cognitive models by which people make concepts of\nthe world73.\nCognitive linguistics makes a distinction between a specific metaphorical expression\nin language (e.g. the modern gladiators for athletes) and the metaphorical concept in our mind\n(SPORT IS FIGHT). General mental concepts thus derive specific linguistic metaphors and\nthrough these concepts we can better understand certain discourse or even culture (K\u00f6vecses,\n2005). As we can see, metaphors in sports discourse are mainly derived from the general\nconcept SPORT IS WAR/BATTLE/FIGHT, and, consequently, we have examples like: They left\ntheir hearts in the arena or The Croatian cavalry swept the French musketeers.\nMetonymies are also an important part of sports discourse and they are mostly derived\nfrom the following concepts: THE PART FOR THE WHOLE (a fresh pair of legs), THE WHOLE FOR\nTHE PART (Croatia scored just before half-time), and OBJECT USED FOR USER (The world\u2019s best\nracquet).\nTraditional rhetoric defines metaphor as a trope which makes a substitution of one\nexpression by another on the ground of similarity (using the analogies), whereas metonymies\nmake substitutions by association (using causal relationships, spatial or temporal relations,\npart-whole relations74 etc.). In short, metonymy is a trope that relies on the contiguity, while\nmetaphor relies on similarity. Cognitive linguistics adopted this generalized difference but\ntried to connect metonymy with the concept of \"reference point\" where one conceptual entity\n73 This concept was introduced in the well-known book Metaphors We Live By (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980). For\nfurther information on cognitive linguistic research concerning metaphor and metonymy see K\u00f6vecses, 2002.\n74 Although classical rhetoric connects part-whole relations with synecdoche, we decided to stay in concordance\nwith the cognitive linguistic approach to metonymy.\n413 provides mental access to another conceptual entity (Kri\u0161kovi\u0107 and Tominac, 2009; Radden\nand K\u00f6vecses, 1999).\nWhen analyzing conceptual metaphors and metonymies it is important to distinguish\nthe source domain (physical entity), from which the cognitive processes transfer the\nsimilarity/contiguity relations, and the target domain (abstract entity) to which these concepts\nare applied. In the concept SPORT IS FIGHT the targets like athletes or clubs (the conceptual\ntarget is SPORT) obtain their metaphorical expressions from the source domain concerning\nfights, especially using words with a historical meaning (gladiators, musketeers, cavalry etc.).\nA similar method is used for analyzing metonymies. For example, the target \"substitute\" uses\nthe source/vehicle \"reserve bench\" because they are connected by the concept CONTAINER FOR\nTHE CONTENT, and as a result we get the expression: A good coach is judged by the good\nbench.\nClassical antonomasias created inside sports discourse are not strictly metonymic in\ntheir origin. Although the context establishes them as an unambiguous substitute for a\nparticular proper name, the word or phrase used in substitution are often created through the\nsame concepts as metaphors.75 Metaphoric antonomasias use the general concept SPORT IS\nWAR/BATTLE/FIGHT to derive particular substitutions for athletes, clubs or national teams. The\nsources, therefore, must belong to the physical reality which corresponds to the general\nconcept of conflict. When we approach antonomasia in this manner then there is no surprise\nthat most \"nicknames\" belong either to predators (the Eagles, the Barracudas, the Wolves),\narmed conflict \"professions\" (the Musketeers, the Cowboys, the Gunners) or entities\nconnected with aggression and destruction (the Fiery Ones, the Red Devils, La Furia).\nA similar classification can be done for metonymic antonomasias but the general\nconcept which is used in their creation can be described as a modified THE PART FOR WHOLE\n75 It is obvious that the uncritical transfer of the metonymy/metaphor relation to the classical/Vossian\nantonomasia dichotomy can be more than just misleading. The origin of classical antonomasia can be found in\nboth metonymic and metaphoric conceptualization.\n414 concept. As it will be shown in the research results, there are some typical source/vehicle\ndomains which are used in the creation of metonymic sports antonomasias. The most\nimportant ones are the kit color, the name of the club, the sports emblem or the sponsor. It\nmust be emphasized that these relations are easily understood by sports discourse participants\nin the know (authors and readers/spectators/listeners), but for the \"outsiders\" these relations\nare not so obvious and that is the reason why sometimes they can not recognize particular\nantonomasia.\n2. Aims of research and methods\nIn order to better understand the role of antonomasia in sports discourse we conducted\nresearch through which we gathered instances of antonomasia from both written and spoken\nsports discourse. By analyzing the collected examples we tried to answer the three questions:\n1. What is the main target domain of sports antonomasias? 2. Are classical sports\nantonomasias more metonymic or metaphoric in origin? 3. Is there a difference between the\nuse of antonomasias in written and in spoken (televised) discourse?\nThe analyzed corpus consisted of three groups of sports news: sports news articles in\nthe daily newspapers (24 sata, Jutarnji list, Ve\u010dernji list and Vjesnik); articles in the\nspecialized sports newspapers and magazines (Hrvatska ko\u0161arka, Nogomet and Sportske\nnovosti); and the prime-time sports news in the daily news program of the three Croatian\nnational networks (HRT \u2013 Croatian Radio Television, Nova TV and RTL). All the\nnewspapers were published and all the television news was broadcast in the same week: from\nMonday, January 23rd, until Sunday, January 29th 2012.\nThe research focused on the journalistic style and, therefore, we had to exclude quotes\n(made by athletes or coaches) which appeared in the interviews or news reports. All\nsubstitutions of proper names which were contextually dependent and non-figurative (e.g.\n415 Na\u0161i su dali gol = Our team (meaning the Croatian national handball team) scored a goal;\nBrazilac = Brazilian (used for Sammir, a football player from Brazil); nogometa\u0161i iz Zagreba\n= football players from Zagreb (meaning GNK Dinamo Zagreb players)) were not treated as\nantonomasias.\n3. Results and Discussion 76\nUsing the described methodological approach we gathered a total number of 640\ninstances of classical antonomasia and in the ensuing analysis we will refer to this number as\ntokens. Of course, many instances were repeated during the observed week so we needed to\nfind out how many different antonomasias appeared in the analyzed corpus. After reducing\ntokens to a single headword (for example antonomasia Bijeli = The Whites (Hajduk F.C.)\nappeared 80 times), we came up with 154 different antonomasias. There were only 3 different\nVossian antonomasias, which is not so extraordinary because antonomasia occurs primarily in\nits classical form in sports discourse. The instances of Vossian antonomasia were therefore\nnot included in the further analysis.\nAfter the tokens were reduced to headwords they could be classified according to their\ntarget domain (name of the athlete, club etc.), source domain (kit color, sponsor, emblem etc.),\nsport and type of antonomasia (metaphoric, metonymic or combined77). Secondary\ninformation was attached to each token concerning the position of the specific token in the\ntext (headline or body text). This information was necessary to better understand the specific\nuse of antonomasia in sports discourse as it was obvious that in written discourse antonomasia\noccurred frequently in the headlines (especially on the front covers).\n76 Since the examples were collected from the Croatian media, in this paper they will be always presented in\nCroatian with the English translation the first time when they appear. The target of the examples discussed or\nused for illustration will also be explained the first time (unless they were already explained in the Introduction).\n77 We needed to differentiate the combined type from the classical and Vossian since those examples could not\nbe strictly classified as metaphoric or metonymic in origin.\n416 3.1 Target domains of sports antonomasias\nThe question about target domains of sports antonomasia was not difficult to answer.\nAfter classifying headwords by their target domain, we constructed the following chart with\ntwelve categories.\nChart 1 Target domains by category\n417 The categories with the largest number of different antonomasias were club, athlete\nand national team. Examples in these three categories constituted 87% of all the headwords.\nAs it is evident from the chart, many categories were represented by only a single example. It\nis somewhat surprising that clubs and national teams are so frequently substituted by\nantonomasia in comparison to individual athletes. However, this is very logical: clubs and\nnational teams are durable in contrast to a career of an individual athlete and, consequently,\ntheir figurative name remains present in the cultural memory. Moreover, absolute\nantonomasias like King of Athletics see their referents change in accordance with the constant\nbreaking of records. Yesterday it was Carl Lewis, today it is Ussain Bolt, and tomorrow who\nknows (but there is only one club in Croatia that is always The Whites).\nOne might ask how nicknames like Kauboji = the Cowboys (for the Croatian national\nhandball team), Vatreni = The Fiery Ones (for the Croatian national football team) or\nBarakude = the Barracudas (for the Croatian national water polo team) can be treated as\nclassical antonomasia if the definition requires a substitution of a proper name. It is obvious\nthat the Croatian national handball/football/water polo teams are not proper names but one has\nto remember that in sports discourse it is quite normal to substitute the phrase \"Croatian\nnational sports team\" by the proper name Croatia using the metonymic concept THE PART FOR\nTHE WHOLE. Therefore, Kauboji, Barakude or Vatreni are antonomasias that substitute the\nproper name Croatia which has already been metonymically used to refer to national sports\nteams representing the Republic of Croatia.\n3.2 Metonymic or metaphoric origin\nAlthough classical antonomasias are used as metonymies because they unambiguously\nrefer to the substituted name, their origin is not always metonymic (as it was explained\nthoroughly in the Introduction). As is visible in Chart 2, one third of the headwords were not\n418 created through the metonymic process. The same proportion is kept in the tokens, but the\nother third of both the headwords and tokens differs in the ratio of metaphor-based and\ncombined type antonomasias (Chart 3).\nChart 2 Proportion of antonomasias (headwords)\nChart 3 Proportion of antonomasias (tokens)\n419 While there are 16% of metaphor-based headwords in the collected list, those\nantonomasias were used more often during the examined week (26%) than those of the\ncombined type.78 There are two possible explanations for this. The first one would be due to\nthe economy of language which prevents frequent use of longer or complex expressions and\nfavors shorter ones. Metaphorical antonomasias in most cases consist of a single word (e.g.\nBarakude, Furija = Fury (the Spanish national team), Kauboji, Vukovi = Wolves (BC Cibona)\netc.), whereas those of the combined type by their definition need to be phrases (e.g. Crveni\nvragovi = the Red Devils (Manchester United F.C.), Argentinski \u010darobnjak = the Argentinean\nWizard (Lionel Messi), Rukometni Mozart = the Handball Mozart (Ivano Bali\u0107), \u0160vicarski\n\u010darobnjak = the Swiss Wizard (Roger Federer) etc.).\nSecond reason for this discrepancy could be found in Chart 4.\nChart 4 Top 10 antonomasias\n78 Many combined-type instances of antonomasia appeared only once during the week (e.g. Majstori s mora =\nthe Masters from the Sea (Hajduk F.C.), Rukometni Jordan = the Handball Jordan (Ivano Bali\u0107) or Briljant s\nistoka = the Brilliant from the East (Victoria Azarenka)).\n420 421 Here are the top 10 antonomasias79 in regard to all the tokens. These 332 instances\nmake one half of all the tokens, therefore, it is interesting to look closer at the metaphor-\nmetonymy ratio. As it was shown in Charts 2 and 3, the metonymically based antonomasias\nare in light gray, metaphor-based in dark gray and combined-type in white. The\nmetaphorically created antonomasias (Barakude, Kauboji and Furija) make one third of the\nlist, which again shows how a relatively small number of metaphor-based headwords is\nfrequently used in sports discourse. These three examples confirm the dominance of the\nconcept SPORT IS WAR/BATTLE/FIGHT in the creation of typical metaphorical antonomasias and\nthis could be the second explanation of the discrepancy between the headwords and the tokens.\nAn interesting coincidence is that these metaphoric antonomasias represent the three typical\ngroups (predators, professions, aggressive entities) discussed earlier in the paper.\nOnly one individual athlete came into the top 10 and that was the ultimate fighter\nMirko Filipovi\u0107, worldwide known as Cro Cop. When we compare this example with the\nother top 10 example Crveni vragovi, it is easy to distinguish strict metonymically based\nantonomasia from that of the combined type. Although both examples are phrases, Cro Cop\nhas both a metonymic head and a dependent (Mirko Filipovi\u0107 was indeed member of\nCroatia\u2019s Police Special Forces tactical unit), while Crveni vragovi has a metaphoric head\n(Devils) and a metonymic part (Red) corresponding to the kit color. All phrasal antonomasias\nrequire both parts in order to become unambiguous substitutions of a certain athlete, club or\nnational team. The simple antonomasia Cop is uncertain without its dependent part Cro; on\nthe other hand, the \"simple\" antonomasias Vragovi (Devils) or Crveni (The Reds) could be\nused as sports antonomasias because both parts use metaphorical or metonymical concepts\ntypically used in the creation of sports antonomasias. A partial confirmation of this theoretical\n79 We are aware that this is not the list of the most frequent or the most common sports antonomasias in the\nCroatian media. These results largely depend on the matches or tournaments played in the analyzed week.\nNevertheless, they are all highly recognizable and generally used in the Croatian sports discourse.\n422 possibility is found in the metonymical \"nickname\" The Reds denoting Liverpool F.C.,\nBenfica F.C., and Split F.C., as it is their typical kit color.\nThis chart is also suitable for pointing out the most common sources of metonymic\nantonomasias. It is the kit color (The Whites, The Blues), name of the club (Medvjedi = the\nBears from the name of the hockey club Medve\u0161\u010dak80) or off-sport profession (Cro Cop).\nBeside these, there are metonymic antonomasias whose source is the club or national team\nemblem (The Hammers (West Ham F.C.), The Eagles (the Serbian national handball team)) or\nthe sponsor (The Pharmacists (Bayer Leverkusen F.C. or Slaven Belupo F.C.)).\nWe have to mention that there were a few examples whose sources were very\ninteresting, for instance Vu\u010dica = the She-Wolf (Roma F.C.) and Pjesnici = the Poets (Zagreb\nF.C.). In the first case, the antonomasia\u2019s source is a famous mythological story about Rome\u2019s\nfounders Romulus and Remus and the she-wolf which nursed the abandoned twins. The\nreference point for this metonymic antonomasia was therefore directly connected to the home\ntown and not to the football club itself. The source of the second antonomasia, Pjesnici, is\nmuch more complex. The Zagreb F.C. stadium is situated in Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva Street, Silvije\nStrahimir Kranj\u010devi\u0107 being a famous Croatian 19th century poet. Therefore, Zagreb\u2019s players\nare the Poets. The reference point in this case could be described as double-shifted from the\ntarget domain.\n3.3. Antonomasia in written and in spoken sports discourse\nThe third question, the difference in the use of antonomasia in written and in spoken\nsports discourse, was the most difficult to answer. In our corpus of 640 examples only 34\n(around 5%) were collected from TV news. There are several reasons for this disproportion,\nbut we are aware that the basic one is the fact that written and spoken sports discourse was not\n80 Name of the club comes from the name of a historical district in the city of Zagreb, and its etymology is\nderived from the Croatian word medvjed (bear).\n423 equally represented in our research. There was no spoken counterpart for the written articles\nin the specialized newspapers and magazines and that is the reason why we had so many more\nexamples from written sports discourse. Nevertheless, when we compared daily newspapers\nsports articles and TV sports news about the same topic (for instance, the outcome of a\nhandball match), in most cases there was not a single example of antonomasia in the TV\nsports news. Quite the contrary, in almost every written article antonomasia was used at least\nonce to substitute a particular name. We were compelled to make a qualitative comparison\nbetween the two media since there was no ground for quantitative analysis.\nIn our opinion, the most important reason for a low frequency of antonomasia in\nspoken articles is a general difference between the two media. The visual stimulus in TV\nnews requires less linguistic material \u2013 we simply see what is/was happening. This makes the\nuse of tropes redundant because sports subjects do not need to be verbalized as often as in\nwritten discourse (TV news also benefits from name captions which are, for instance, shown\nwhen an athlete is giving a press statement).\nThe other reason is the amount of text in written and in spoken discourse. The sports\nnews program on Croatian TV channels usually lasts up to 5 minutes (including four reports\nat least) and it usually provides basic information (the time and place of the event, participants,\nscore etc). On the other hand, written sports articles are obliged to provide more extensive\ncommentaries beside basic information. This gives written discourse more opportunity to\nrepeat the same names.\nBefore we conducted the research, we expected to find the same examples in written\nand in spoken discourse (at least the most frequent ones), but to our surprise spoken discourse\nwas again antonomastically \"poorer\". Out of our top 10 most frequent tokens, only 3 appeared\nin both written and spoken discourse and 7 of them were found only in written discourse. This\ncan be illustrated by the following chart.\n424 Chart 5 Top 10 antonomasias in the daily newspapers and TV news\n425 These numbers represent tokens in the daily newspapers and TV news. As mentioned\nearlier, we ignored specialized newspapers and magazines because we did not have the\nappropriate specialized sports program. Out of the original 304 top 10 tokens belonging to\nwritten discourse, only 122 tokens appeared in the daily newspapers. This \"loss\" is more\nevident when we compare Charts 4 and 5. That is the reason why we kept the same order of\nantonomasias.\nThe only instance of antonomasia that appeared more often in spoken than in written\ndiscourse (21:12) was Kauboji. This antonomasia was so frequently used in the TV news\nbecause that week (at the European Men\u2019s Handball Championship) the Croatian national\nteam beat the French national team in the match that journalists named Rukometni El Classico\n= Handball El Classico. In the semifinal match the Cowboys played against the Eagles and\nthis event had wide press coverage not only in sports news.\nThe last reason for the disproportion of antonomasias in the two media could be found\nin the function of headlines in newspapers. The headline has a key role as an entrance to the\ntext, its function is \"to lure\" a reader (Ivas 2004: 10). Owing to its position and graphic design,\nthe headline will certainly attract attention; if it is figurative, this attraction is amplified. That\nis the main reason why journalists formulate headlines figuratively. Since antonomasia in\nsports discourse has an additional function of identification (journalists use them because their\nrecipients will surely recognize the substituted target), it does not come as a surprise that\nexactly every fifth example of written antonomasias appeared in newspaper headlines. The\ncover pages of all the newspapers in our research profusely used antonomasia in the headlines\nand so we can conclude that antonomasia certainly has a big emotional impact on sports\nreaders, especially in attracting them to buy and read newspaper.\n426 4. Conculsion\nIn our research we tried to answer three questions that concerned the role of\nantonomasia in Croatian sports discourse. The primary targets of classical antonomasias are\nshown to be clubs, athletes and national teams (in that exact order). Two out of three\nheadword antonomasias were metonymic in origin, and the same ratio is kept in the tokens.\nMetaphor-based antonomasias are used more often than the combined type because the\neconomy of language favors the use of shorter expressions and the combined type is\nnecessarily a phrase. The other reason for the more frequent use of metaphorical\nantonomasias can be found in their realization of the general concept SPORT IS CONFLICT\n(using the names of predators, war professions or aggressive entities). The source of\nmetonymic antonomasias was in most cases the kit color, the emblem, the name of the club or\nthe name of the city the club comes from. The referential point is in most cases very obvious\nalthough there are some examples which require more sports or even cultural knowledge in\ndetecting the connection between the target and the source/vehicle.\nWe could not give a straightforward answer whether antonomasias are used more in\nwritten or in spoken discourse \u2013 instead we tried to point out possible reasons why there were\nso many newspaper tokens when compared to those from TV. The general difference between\nthe two media obviously generates difference in the use of antonomasia. Television reports\nrequire less linguistic material because they benefit from the visual stimulus and they usually\nprovide their recipients with basic information about sports events. Written sports discourse\nuses the advantage of headlines as attractors and that is the reason why every fifth instance of\nantonomasia appeared there.\nThe most important contribution of this research is the affirmation of the role which\nantonomasia has inside sports discourse. It connects journalists and the recipients of sports\nnews (reader, spectators and listeners) and identifies them as participants in sports discourse.\n427 Although many sports antonomasias have transcended their original discourse and have\nbecome known to the general audience, there are still many more of them which are known\nand used only by true connoisseurs.\nReferences\nAnderson, R.

A rhetorical perspective on marketing\ncommunication\nSabrina Mazzali-Lurati & Chiara Pollaroli, University of Lugano\nSummary\nThis contribution aims at exploring the domain of business communication from a rhetorical perspective. A full\ncomprehension of the rhetorical situation \u2013 especially of its participants \u2013 where a communicative event is\nascribed, is fundamental in order to produce an effective text. Participants in a rhetorical situation are framed as\nstakeholders: they are interested and favour a successful communicative event in relation to its rhetorical\nsituation.\nWe will present our rhetorical approach through the example of four texts from the category of promotional\ngenres in a commercial realm. Insights into similar analyses of texts belonging to different realms will be briefly\nprovided. We will also mention how our rhetorical approach can be useful in educational contexts, such as\nRhetoric and Composition courses.\nKey words: stakeholder, rhetorical situation, business communication, discourse genre,\npromotional text\n1. Introduction\nThis study explores the domain of business communication from a rhetorical viewpoint. At\nthe core of our approach is the concept of rhetorical situation (henceforth RS), namely a\ncontext composed of persons, events, objects, relations, needs and expectations (cf. Bitzer,\n1968) in respect to which a text aims at successfully achieving a given goal. The RS\nconfiguration has an influence on a text\u2019s contents, structure and style. Therefore, considering\nand understanding the RS is essential in order to produce an effective text.\nMany studies have shown difficulties in defining the RS of promotional genres,\nespecially in identifying and characterizing the actors taking part in an advertisement (Atkin\nand Richardson, 2005); some scholars have defined the addresser as a \u201ccorporate persona\ncreated by the ad agency\u201d (Corbett and Connors, 1999: 3; see also Brierley, 1995: 57;\n430 Calabrese, 2008: 28). Our approach allows us to describe in detail the participants, their needs\nand influences on the text, thus moving beyond generic references to advertisers and\nconsumers and proving a systematic perspective on the text RS.\nThe kernel notion to our approach is, together with the notion of genre (as a set of\nprefabricated communicative choices realizing a specific communicative task in a given\ncontext; cf. Bakhtin 1986 and the relationship he underlines between discourse genres and\ndifferent spheres of human activity), that of stakeholders.\nThe notion of stakeholders stems from the domain of corporate communication and\nrefers to those people who have a stake in the activity of an enterprise, thus wish that the\nenterprise would succeed and work in their favour. In a similar perspective, we claim that all\ntexts written in an enterprise in order to carry out its activity and achieve its goal have\nstakeholders, i.e. persons who have an interest in the communicative success of those texts.\nBy describing the stakeholders of a text, it is possible to gain an in-depth understanding of\nactors playing within a given communicative situation and their roles. This notion has been\napplied to the analysis and production of texts written to carry out various organization\nactivities and has been successfully integrated in a course on Rhetoric and Composition at the\nUniversity of Lugano.\nIn this paper we will show this especially through four promotional genres, which\nhave a similar generic goal (i.e. to advertise a product or a service), but different structure and\nstyle: a press release, a brochure, a print ad and a TV commercial. By applying our model of\nstakeholders, we will be able to shed light on the diverse RSs generating texts.\nSection 2 presents the research gap where this contribution fits in. When adopting a basic\nfunctional model of communication it is rather difficult to fully characterize a communicative\nevent and its participants. The model of context proposed by Rigotti and Rocci (2006) seems\nto be adequate when conceiving communicative events as complex interactions where people\n431 wish to accomplish their goals. Rhetorical discourse is always bound to a context; its situated\nnature can be well described through Bitzer\u2019s concept of rhetorical situation, which will be\noutlined in section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the introduction of the notion of stakeholder.\nThis is a kernel notion to our approach since we believe that all texts (either written or\nspoken) are created in order to carry out an organization activity and achieve its goals. To\nbetter describe the notion of stakeholders and to relate it to those of genre and rhetorical\nsituation, in section 5 we take as examples four promotional texts \u2013 a press release, a\nbrochure, a print ad and a TV commercial. The stakeholders approach is a valuable tool for\nteaching how to produce effective texts which adhere to the exigence of a given rhetorical\nsituation. In section 6 we show how it can be used to make students aware of the situated\ncharacter of a text.\n2. The research gap\nAs it has been noticed in different works on advertising discourse, in promotional genres a\ndifficulty in identifying the participants to a communication (particularly, addressers and\naddressees) is often highlighted. The key question to be answered in order to understand\nadvertising discourse appears to be \u201cwho is communicating with who?\u201d (Atkin and\nRichardson, 2005: 165). The non-coincidence among those persons who \u201cphysically\u201d and\nactually produce the ad, managers who require the ad, and the \u201cvoice which speaks in the ad\u201d\nis usually pointed out as a demonstration of the difficulty in identifying an ad\u2019s addresser(s).\nAs for instance Corbett and Connors (1999: 3) observe\nIn most ads, as in most forms of technical writing, the least prominent of the\ncomponents is the speaker/writer. Who is addressing us in the ad? Most ads are\ncomposed by the staff of the ad agency that the company or the manufacturer hired.\nThe speaker or writer in an ad \u2013 unlike the speaker or writer in a speech or an essay \u2013\n432 is not a particular person; it is usually a corporate persona created by the ad agency\n[\u2026].\nThe actors playing the role of addressers in an advertising text are defined as \u201ca corpora\npersona\u201d, a blurred entity whose characteristics are hard to distinguish. Similarly, Corbett and\nConnors (1999: 3) point out difficulties in identifying an ad\u2019s addressee(s). The most\nstraightforward answer to the question \u201cwhom is the ad addressing?\u201d seems to be \u201c \u2018the reader\nof the ad\u2019, referred to frequently by the second-person pronoun you\u201d. However it appears to\nbe unclear who is you: is it an individual or a group of people? For instance, in relation to an\nad for the Hewlett Packard printer they are commenting, Corbett and Connors observe that\nOne possible candidate as an antecedent for the pronoun you is the administrative\nofficer of a company that is responsible for purchasing equipment, such as typewriters\nor computers or printers for the workers. In that case, the you stands for a group of\npeople. On the other hand, the you may stand for an individual out there who is in the\nmarket for a color printer. The point is that the audience for most ads is not as easily\ndefinable as is the audience, for instance, for a nomination speech at a national\npolitical convention. We just sense that there is somebody out there \u2013 preferably\nthousands of people \u2013 that the ad-writer wants to persuade to buy something. (Corbett\nand Connors, 1999: 3)\nThese difficulties usually emerge when the communicative action of advertising is described\naccording to basic functional models of communication, such as (as it is the case in Corbett\nand Connors, 1999) the communication triangle (Figure 1), derived from Kinneavy (1969:\n302, 1971) and referring to B\u00fchler\u2019s and Jakobson\u2019s models of communication:81\n81 Kinneavy (1969: 301) is mainly concerned with composition and the classification of aims of discourse and\nshows that a discourse can focus on either the encoder (expressive function), the decoder (persuasive function),\nthe reality (referential function), or the signal (literary function). Jakobson\u2019s well-known model has a very\nsimilar perspective; he extends the number of functions a text may have distinguishing one function for each\n433 Figure 1 \u2013 Kinneavy\u2019s (1969: 302) communication triangle\nThese models are code-centered, focused on a process of coding and decoding (Rigotti and\nGreco, 2006; Rigotti and Rocci, 2006: 163), and do not adequately take into consideration the\nparticipants and the context in which communication processes are created and live. Rigotti\nand Cigada (2004: 23-56) point out that each communication act is an event, in other words it\nis something that happens and that \u201ctouches\u201d us, \u201cmoves\u201d us, changes us because we are\ninterested in it. Meaning corresponds to this change. Thus, a communication event is not\nsimply a relation between a signal and the participants, it is not a process of encoding and\ndecoding a message, but it is a continuous process of interpretation of the meaning of the\nmessage in relation to the whole situation in which the communication event takes place.\nIn order to overcome the difficulties in understanding who are the participants in the\ncommunication process of advertising, a more refined model of the context of communication\nand the communicative situation is needed. Particularly, more refined conceptual tools for the\ndescription of the relationship between a text, its goal, and task (which, according to the\ntradition of Ancient rhetoric, we call officium \u2013 cf. Greco Morasso, 2009: 222 - and which\nelement constituting the communicative process. Similarities are evident also in respect to B\u00fchler\u2019s (1934)\ncommunication model: the signal is placed in the middle of a triangle and it establishes relations with a sender, a\nreceiver, and an object. Kinneavy himself acknowledges the strong similarity to Jakobson\u2019s and B\u00fchler\u2019s\nmodels, which, he declares, he discovered after his elaboration of the communication triangle (1969: 301).\n434 relate to the notion of genre \u2013 cf. Askehave and Swales, 2001) and the participants in the\ncommunication are required.\nRigotti and Rocci\u2019s (2006) model of communicative context (stemming from pragmatic\ntheories of verbal communication, particularly from speech act theory; see figure 2) provides\nan adequate conceptual framework. According to these scholars, communication context\nresults from the combination of an institutionalized component and an interpersonal one:\nWithin the institutionalized component, activity types are seen as resulting from the\nmapping of culturally shared interaction schemes onto an actual interaction field (a\nsocial reality characterized by shared goals and mutual commitments). As a result of\nthe mapping, communicative flows and roles are created. Within the interpersonal\ndimension, we distinguish between a relationship-based personal component and a\ncommunal component connected with cultural identities. (Rigotti and Rocci, 2006: 155)\nFigure 2 \u2013 Rigotti and Rocci\u2019s (2006: 171) model of context\nA communicative event such as, for instance, a print ad for training shoes, is composed \u2013 in\nits institutional dimension \u2013 of an activity type of promoting a pair of training shoes. Within\nthis activity type we can identify the market of shoes as the interaction field and advertising as\n435 the interaction scheme. The personal component of the interpersonal dimension is, in the case\nof a print ad, sterile since it is unusual that potential consumers have had previous personal\ncommunicative interactions with the company promoting the training shoes; on the contrary,\nthe communal component is often strongly present since it hints at shared knowledge and\nexperience of advertising within a culture.\nCulturally shared interaction schemes encompass discourse genres, that is, standard\nrhetorical schemes used in order to achieve the goals of a given interaction scheme (Rigotti\nand Rocci, 2006: 173, cf. also Bakhtin 1986: 6082).83 In our example, the interaction scheme\nof advertising extracts the genre of print ad from the group of discourse genres (billboards,\nTV commercials, flyers, etc.) related to a similar communicative practice. Social roles of the\ninteraction field and communicative roles deriving from the implementation of the interaction\nscheme onto the interaction field identify the participants to the communication. From Rigotti\nand Rocci\u2019s model of context it emerges that participants are identified and characterized\nwithin both the institutional and the interpersonal dimensions. In fact, they are characterized\nby the role and function they have in an organization, by the culture to which they belong, by\nprevious interactions they had with other participants and by their personal characteristics and\nattitudes. From this perspective this model highlights that participant\u2019s act in a specific\ncontext with a specific goal. It is often the case that in order to achieve their goal(s)\nparticipants write texts. The context itself in which they act directs and constrains the\nproduction of the text. For instance, an organization which wants to sell its medical products,\nsuch as the example we are going to present later on in this paper, belongs to a specific\ninteraction field (the market of medical products) and, in order to achieve its goal, it activates\n82 Here Bakthin highlights that \u201c[\u2026] each sphere in which language is used develops its own relatively stable\ntypes of these utterances. These we may call speech genres\u201d and that \u201cindividual concrete utterances (oral and\nwritten) by participants in the various areas of human activity [\u2026] reflect the specific conditions and goals of\neach such area\u201d.\n83 The concepts of purpose and task in the definition of genre are stated (and debated) to be fundamental in most\nmajor communicative approaches to genres since the beginning of the \u201cnew\u201d genre movement of the early 1980s\n(Askehave and Swales, 2001: 195-196).\n436 a certain interaction scheme (that of promotional texts) and it produces a certain number of\ntexts belonging to one or more discourse genres (a print ad, a billboard, a brochure, etc.)\nwhich can help the organization increase the sales of their medical products.\nThis model of communication context focuses on the goal to be accomplished and the activity\nto be performed in a specific social environment composed by people, their desires, their\nneeds, their culturally shared knowledge, their view of the world, etc. This viewpoint on\ncommunication events, being then either routine-based or complex, allows us to look at texts\nas contextualized (situated) and subjected to the interpretation of the participants to the event.\n1. The rhetorical situation\nThe contextualized and situated nature of text can be better described by referring to the\nconcept of rhetorical situation developed by Lloyd Bitzer (1968, 1980). According to Bitzer\n\u201crhetoric is situational\u201d (1968: 3), i.e. \u201ca particular discourse comes into existence because of\nsome specific condition or situation which invites utterance\u201d (1968: 4) and \u201crhetorical\ndiscourse comes into existence as a response to situation\u201d (1968: 5), a rhetorical situation, that\nis to \u201ca natural context of persons, events, objects, relations, and an exigence which strongly\ninvites utterance\u201d (1968: 5). More precisely, the constituents of any rhetorical situation are\n\u201can exigence \u2013 a problem or defect, something other than it should be [\u2026] an audience\ncapable of being constrained in thought or action in order to effect positive modification of\nthe exigence [\u2026] a set of constraints capable of influencing the rhetor and an audience\u201d (1980:\n23). Among these constituents, exigence is crucial since we usually react to situations\naccording to how we perceive things are and should be (1980: 25); exigence is the element\nwhich operates the engine of change in communication:\nExigence is the necessary condition of a rhetorical situation. If there were no exigence,\nthere would be nothing to require or invite change in the audience or in the world \u2013\n437 hence there would be nothing to require or invite the creation and presentation of\npragmatic messages. (Bitzer, 1980: 26)\nHuman beings perceive defects, obstacles, and imperfections and urge for some change. This\nurgency is felt because of some interests and valuations toward the rhetorical situation. Bitzer\nspecifies that the constituents of a rhetorical exigence are both a factual condition and an\ninterest relation (1980: 28): factual condition is \u201cany set of things, events, relations, ideas,\nmeanings \u2013 anything physical or mental \u2013 whose existence is (or is thought to be) independent\nof one\u2019s personal subjectivity\u201d; interest is \u201cany appreciation, need, desire, aspiration which,\nwhen related to factual conditions, accounts for the emergence of motives and purposes\u201d\n(1980: 28). The speaker/writer\u2019s decision to speak/write derives from the exigence (i.e., the\nperception of a factual condition and the existence of an interest related to it) and aims to\npositively modify the exigence through discourse that influence audience\u2019s thought or action.\nThis happens quite easily when speaker/writer and audience have the same perception and\nevaluation of the factual condition and the interest composing the exigence.\nIt is likely that speaker and audience disagree on one of these two aspects or even on\nboth. However, \u201cto the extent that apprehension of factual conditions and the experience of\ninterests can be shared\u201d (1980: 30) an exigence can be communicated: \u201cthe rhetor, if he\nknows his audience is capable of experiencing the exigence, will awaken it to the reality of\nthe exigence by providing a representation of the factual condition that evokes or engages the\nrequired interest.\u201d (Bitzer, 1980: 31)\nThis is what happens in advertising (1980: 31), where the speaker/writer sees a factual\ncondition (he offers either a product or a service to clients), perceives an interest in relation to\nit (he wants to sell it), and decides to produce an utterance in order to awaken the addressees\u2019\ninterest for the same factual condition. Once the addressees\u2019 interest is awakened the next step\nis to produce an audience\u2019s action (to buy the product or service) that modifies the audience\u2019s\n438 exigence (the product or service satisfies a need or a desire) and, as a consequence, a positive\nmodification of their exigence to sell the product.\nThis is the pivotal exigence at the basis of any promotional texts and it identifies the\npurpose of the text, what the text aims at. It identifies a basic task of promotional genres, their\nofficium (i.e., the officium of a text consists in positively modifying the exigence for which the\ntext comes into existence) and it is the central constituent of the related rhetorical situation.\nThe speaker/writer of the ad is the person who first perceives the exigence and decides\nto speak/write in order to positively change it. This provides us with a first indication for the\nidentification of the addresser of advertising messages. The speaker/writer is the company that\nwants to sell the advertised product, independently of the fact that they produce the messages\nthemselves or that they charge someone else with producing it. These latter are also actors in\nthe production process of the message, but they participate in it with a different role, which\nwe will more precisely identify in the following section. It is not even the \u201cvoice which\nspeaks in the ad\u201d; as Cook (2001: 4) observes, the sender of the advertising message can\ndiffer from the person who actually speaks it. The latter can correspond both to what the\ntradition of narrative studies (developed by Jameson, 2004a and 2004b within composition\nand business communication) defined as the implied author and the narrator; therefore, it has\nto be distinguished from the actual persons who, with different roles, intervene in the writing\nprocess of the ad.\nThe audience, as Bitzer points out, \u201cmust be distinguished from a body of mere\nhearers or readers [\u2026] [it] consists only of those persons who are capable of being influenced\nby discourse and of being mediators of change\u201d (1968: 8); \u201c[s]ince the audience must be\ncapable of modifying the exigence positively, it follows that listeners incapable of this\nmodifying influence will not count as a rhetorical or functional audience\u201d (1980: 23). In this\nperspective, the rhetorical audience for promotional texts is composed of all those who can\n439 remove the speaker/writer\u2019s exigence, i.e. all those who can buy or can be interested in buying\nthe product. The rhetorical audience will therefore be different according to the kind of\nadvertised product or service; it can be broader or narrower depending on the product. For\ninstance, the rhetorical audience for car advertisements comprise all people who have a\ndriving license or who need a car as a means of transport (therefore, in some countries, almost\nall adult people), while the rhetorical audience for the Hewlett Packard printer mentioned in\nCorbett and Connors 1999 is narrower and it comprises, for instance, organizations where\nmany documents are printed. However, being the advertisement public, all people see it, all\npeople can read the message, even if they are not interested and do not perceive the factual\nconditions of buying a Hewlett Packard printer. Even if they are not the target of the\nspeaker/writer\u2019s exigence, even if they are not those who can positively modify the exigence\nof the speaker/writer, they are in some ways (with a role that we will more precisely describe\nbelow) entitled to take part in the communicative action of the advertisement. Cook (2001: 4)\nand, in his line, Atkin and Richardson (2005: 166) speak of addressees and receivers.\nWhatever the terms and categories we can use, these first distinctions show that, besides\nthe speaker/writer and the audience, other persons are involved in the rhetorical situation.\nThese persons, from Bitzer\u2019s perspective, are sources of constraints that the speaker/writer\ntakes into consideration when operating. We name them stakeholders.\n3. Stakeholders of a text\nThe notion of stakeholders stems from the domain of corporate communication and refers to\nthose people who have a stake in the activity of an organization or institution, thus wish that it\nwould succeed and work in their favour. In a similar perspective, we maintain that all texts\nwritten in an enterprise in order to carry out its activity and achieve its goal have stakeholders,\ni.e. persons who have an interest in the communicative success of the text (Mazzali-Lurati\n2011). Different stakeholders play different roles and have a different interest in respect to the\n440 text. Thanks to the concept of stakeholders it is possible to gain an in-depth understanding of\nactors playing within a given communicative situation and their different roles.\nWe drew the concept from the field of corporate management, where it has been used\nfor the first time by Freeman (1984) in relationship to strategic management (Post et al., 2002:\n18). The conventional model of corporate stakeholders includes, beside investors (who are\ntraditionally considered the partner of the corporation management, the ones the management\nhas to reward and care about \u2013 cf. the ownership view of corporation; Post et al., 2002: 12),\ncustomers and users, also employees, governments, regulatory authorities, unions, joint\nventure partners and alliances, local communities and citizens, private organizations and\nsupply chain associates (Post et. al., 2002: 22).\nFrom the field of corporate management the concept has then been drawn on in the field of\nweb design and usability, in order to identify and refer to the \u201cpersons who have expectations,\ngoals and interests connected to the implementation and success of the site\u201d (Cantoni et al.,\n2003: 32; translated by the authors). In web design and usability stakeholders are users,\nclients, decision makers, opinion makers, project managers, product managers, domain and\ncontent experts, content providers, as well as the development team (Perrone et al., 2005).\nSome of these categories of stakeholders appear to be relevant not only in relationship\nto the corporation, its activity and its website, but also in relationship to the texts that are daily\nand continuously written in the realm of the corporation\u2019s activity. For instance, texts\nproduced in the written communication of organizations have clients (someone who asks to\nwrite the text in order to face a given exigence) and users or customers (the persons who are\nmeant to read the texts and to react to it) and, sometimes, have regulatory authorities, that is,\npersons or institutions that elaborate rules (at the level of content and at the level of their\npresentation) the text has to follow and respect. Drawing on a concept from media sociology\nwe see that texts in organizations sometimes also have gatekeepers, that is, individuals and\n441 groups that have the power to let information get through channels of communication or to\nblock it (Lewin, 1947: 145).84\nIn line with fundamental pragmatic approaches to verbal communication (cf. Clark\n1996: 14-15), the identification of the stakeholders of a text can be refined by taking into\nconsideration the description of the roles of the participants to communication elaborated by\nGoffman (1979). In his work on footing, the Canadian sociologist observed that \u201c[w]hen one\nuses the term \u2018speaker\u2019, one often implies that the individual who animates is formulating his\nown text and staking out his own position through it\u201d (Goffman, 1979: 145). However, in\ncommunication, situations in which the individual who animates the text is different from the\none who formulates it and from the one who stakes his own position through it are very\nfrequent. \u201cPlainly, reciting a fully memorized text or reading aloud from a prepared script\nallows us to animate words we had no hand in formulating, and to express opinions, beliefs,\nand sentiments we do not hold. We can openly speak for someone else and in someone else\u2019s\nwords, as we do, say, in reading a deposition or providing a simultaneous translation of a\nspeech \u2013 the latter an interesting example because so often the original speaker\u2019s words,\nalthough ones that person commits himself to, are ones that someone else wrote for him\u201d\n(Goffman, 1979: 145-146). In other words, Goffman pointed out that behind the word\n\u201cspeaker\u201d three different roles are hidden: the animator (\u201can individual active in the role of\nutterance production\u201d; 1979: 144), the author (\u201csomeone who has selected the sentiments that\nare being expressed and the words in which they are encoded\u201d; 1979: 144) and the principal\n(\u201cSomeone whose position is established by the words that are spoken, someone whose\nbeliefs have been told, someone who is committed to what the words say\u201d; 1979: 144). This is,\nas Atkin and Richardson (2005: 166) already noticed, precisely in respect to advertising, a\nvery relevant distinction, that provides a deeper insight about the participants in the\n84 See for instance the role played by the journalist who screens news and press releases for deciding which news\nis worth being published in the newspaper (Wolf, 1996: 178-179).\n442 communication. Similarly, Goffman observed that behind the term \u201chearer\u201d three different\nroles have to be distinguished: the addressee (the person/s to whom the utterance is addressed;\nMcCawley, 1999: 596; cf. Goffman, 1979: 131-133),85 the ratified participant (the person/s\nwho hold/s an \u201cofficial status as a ratified participant in the encounter\u201d; Goffman, 1979: 131;\nMcCawley, 1999: 596) and the overhearer/bystander (the person/s who follow/s the talk\nunintentionally and inadvertently or surreptitiously; Goffmann, 1979: 131-132; McCawley,\n1999: 596). Thus, \u201c[t]he ratified hearer in two-person talk is necessarily also the \u2018addressed\u2019\none, that is, the one to whom the speaker addresses his visual attention and to whom,\nincidentally, he expects to turn over the speaking role\u201d (Goffman, 1979: 132-133), while in\nencounters in which three or more official participants are found, \u201cit will often be feasible for\nthe current speaker to address his remarks to the circle as a whole, encompassing all his\nhearers in his glance, according them something like equal status. But, more likely, the\nspeaker will, at least during periods of his talk, address his remarks to one listener, so that\namong official hearers one must distinguish the addressed recipient from \u2018unaddressed\u2019 ones\u201d\n(Goffman, 1979: 133). And this is a very common situation in communication, as well as\nsituations in which bystanders and overhearers are involved:\n[\u2026] much of talk takes place in the visual and aural range of persons who are not\nratified participants and whose access to the encounter, however minimal, is itself\nperceivable by the official participants. These adventitious participants are\n\u2018bystanders\u2019. Their presence should be considered the rule, not the exception. In some\ncircumstances they can temporarily follow the talk, or catch bits and pieces of it, all\nwithout much effort or intent, becoming, thus, overhearers. In other circumstances\nthey may surreptitiously exploit the accessibility they find they have, thus qualifying\n85 For the description of Goffman\u2019s roles we refer, besides Goffman\u2019s original text, to the same model recovered\nby McCawley 1999.\n443 as eavesdroppers, here not dissimilar to those who secretly listen in on conversations\nelectronically (Goffman, 1979: 132).\nCombining the original classification of stakeholders developed in the management field, the\none elaborated from scholars dealing with a websites production, Goffman\u2019s roles of\nparticipants in communication, adding the category of gatekeeper highlighted by media\nsociology, and applying them to written communication in organizations, we obtain the\nclassification of eight different stakeholder roles of a text: the principal, the author, the\nanimator, the addressee, the ratified participant, the overhearer/bystander, the gatekeeper, and\nthe regulator (table 1).\nIn the following, on the basis of an example, we will show that the description of the\nstakeholders of a text according to this classification can clarify and describe in a richer way\nthe communicative situation of promotional texts.\nTable 1 \u2013 Stakeholders\nRole Description\nAnimator Someone who materially writes a text\nby activating a writing technology.\nAuthor Someone who produces a text\nformulating the content and choosing\nexpressive strategies. The author is often\nasked to write a text and to accomplish a\ncommunicative purpose by a\ncommissioner. In an organization it is\nlikely to have many authors\n(collaborative writing).\nPrincipal The principal is the source of the text\ncontent, expressed opinion, and\ncommunicative goal. The author must\nrealize the principal\u2019s communicative\ngoal when writing. The principal is\nresponsible, even in legal terms, for the\ntext. The principal\u2019s opinion is\nexpressed in the text. The principal can\nalso be an institution or an enterprise.\n444 Addressee The person to whom the text is directly\nand explicitly addressed.\nRatified participant Someone who the text is not directly\naddressed to but is entitled to take part\nin the communicative event as a right.\nOverhearer/Bystander Someone who can come in contact \u2013\ndirectly or indirectly \u2013 with a text\nwithout either the principal or the\nauthor\u2019s knowledge. He is not the\naddressee to whom the principal directs\nthe text. Overhearers include opinion\nleaders, who can be affected by the text\neven if they are not addressees. The\nimportance of an overhearer varies\naccording to the text distribution.\nGatekeeper Someone who, thanks to his/her role in a\nspecific social context, can decide\nwhether the text can reach its addressees\nor not.\nRegulator A government or control authority who\ngives norms and regulations for how\ncommunication should be maintained\nand how texts should be written. It can\nbe either a national or independent\ninstitution.\n1. Rhetorical situation of three different promotional genres\nLet us take, as examples, a press release, a brochure, a print ad and a TV commercial\npromoting Xylo Mepha, 86 a generic nasal spray for adults and children, marketed by Mepha\nPharma AG (a Swiss leader manufacturer and wholesaler of generic pharmaceutical products).\nThe press release titled \u201cXylo-Mepha \u2013 lo spray nasale senza conservanti\u201d87 was published on\npressportal.ch on October 31st 2005 to launch the nasal spray and give information about it;\nthe press release was issued by Mepha Pharma AG and Martina Beranek is indicated as the\nperson to contact in order to have more information about the launch of the product. The\n86 The authors asked Mepha Pharma AG for permission to publish images of the press release, the brochure, the\nprint ad, and the TV commercial, but permission was denied.\n87 [\u201cXyo-Mepha \u2013 the nasal spray without preservatives\u201d] Authors\u2019 translation.\n445 brochure is composed of 6 pages: the front page shows the picture of a woman and a little girl\nsmiling at each other and the title \u201cMeglio informati sul raffreddore\u201d88, the back page gives\ndetails about who should use the product (a pack shot of the product is also depicted) and how,\ninternal pages give information on what is a cold. The same image of a woman and a little girl\nis employed as the visual of the print ad published on SunStore; the headline reads\n\u201cRaffreddore? Xylo-Mepha Libera il naso in pochi minuti \u2013 per ore\u201d89 and it is matched with\nthe pack shot of the nasal spray. The TV commercial has a problem-solution structure: the\nviewer sees a woman suffering from a cold and the product Xylo-Mepha, the same woman is\nthen presented happily playing in the snow with her little girl. In the following sections, firstly\nwe characterize the four texts from the point of view of genre, by highlighting the exigence\nthey face and by describing the goal they pursue. Secondly, we identify their stakeholders.\nIn terms of genre\nThese four texts are responses to the producer\u2019s exigence of selling the product. The officium\nof all these four texts is to positively modify this exigence by making the rhetorical audience\naware of the factual condition (the Xylo-Mepha nasal spray) and its interest (all the\nadvantages it provides in respect to other nasal sprays), thus awakening in it an exigence (to\nbenefit from Xylo-Mepha nasal spray) that pushes to an action (to buy Xylo-Mepha nasal\nspray) capable of modifying the producer\u2019s exigence of selling the product. This is an\nexigence that creates a complex rhetorical situation (Bitzer 1968: 12) and, as it is the case for\nmost rhetorical situations in the realm of business communication, a highly structured one\n(Bitzer, 1968: 12), i.e. a rhetorical situation that employs usual and well-known\ncommunicative practices, for which in the course of time a structured rhetorical response has\n88 [\u201cBetter informed on cold\u201d] Authors\u2019 translation.\n89 [\u201cCold? Xylo-Mepha Unblock you nose in few minutes \u2013 for hours] Authors\u2019 translation.\n446 been elaborated. This structured rhetorical response corresponds to Bakhtinian discourse\ngenres.\nIndeed, the whole officium of meeting the exigence of selling the product in the\nactivity type of advertising in the field of business is carried out through the activation of\n\u201cculturally shared \u2018recipe[s]\u2019\u201d (Rigotti and Rocci, 2006: 173) of advertising a product, an\ninteraction scheme that relies on the employment of different textual genres. Each of them\naccomplishes a sub-officium through a given combination of thematic content, style, and\ncompositional structure (cf. Bakhtin, 1986: 60) that has proved to be the most adequate to\nreach a specific goal. In our case the sub-officia are to announce the launch of Xylo Mepha on\nthe market (the press release), to inform people about how cold develops and Xylo Mepha\u2019s\npositive effects on it (the brochure), to call to the attention the existence and availability of\nXylo Mepha (the print ad and the TV commercial).\nThe complex rhetorical situation described above is broken down into sub-rhetorical\nsituations, which differ in respect to the specific officium and the participants involved in the\ncommunication event, that is in respect to the involved stakeholders.\nIn terms of stakeholders\nThe press release, on the one side, the brochure, the print ad and the TV commercial, on the\nother side, differ in respect to the addressed rhetorical audience. The addressee of the press\nrelease (published online on a news portal)90 can be identified with both the journalists using\nthe portal and all other users of this website (people who plausibly are interested in recent\nnews). On the one hand, journalists aim at bringing themselves up to date with recent news\nwhich they can write articles on, they are also concerned with understanding what kind of\nproduct Xylo Mepha is and which advantages it has over similar products. Web-users in\n90 The press release is published on presseportal.ch, a service offered by news aktuell (Schweiz) AG, a company\nof the group of the Swiss national news agency.\n447 general, not working as journalists, are also interested in knowing more about the product, but\nthey may not have a specific goal concerning this product.91 The brochure can be both\ndownloaded in pdf format from the organization website and taken in paper version from\nchemists\u2019 (when it is available on the counter), thus addressees are both website users and\nchemist\u2019s clients who need to understand what kind of product Xylo Mepha is and what are\nits advantages over other nasal sprays.92 The print ad is published on the magazine SunStore;\ntherefore readers of SunStore magazine are the addressees of the print ad, the magazine is\nboth sent by mail to Ticinese citizens and available in chemists\u2019. The audience of the TV\ncommercial encompasses all TV viewers: everyone watching TV receives the message and\ncounts as someone being able to positively modifying the principal\u2019s exigence of selling Xylo\nMepha.\nIn Bitzer\u2019s terms, the speaker/writer of the four texts is Mepha Pharma AG, particularly its\nmanagers. According to our framework of stakeholders we name this participant in the\ncommunicative event principal. However, at least in the cases of the print ad and of the TV\ncommercial, it is likely that Mepha Pharma AG managers did not produce the text; it is likely\nthat the principal commissioned the creation and production of these two texts to a specialized\nadvertising agency, which holds the role of author. Besides, the print ad had to be \u201cprinted\nsomewhere\u201d, namely in some specialized magazines devoted to informing pharmacies\u2019 clients\non different topics and products related to health and wellness. This brings into play another\nactor, namely the publisher of the magazine, who holds the role of animator of the print ad:\n91 Organizations and corporations are getting used to publishing press releases on web portals or on their\nwebsites. In such cases, both the wide public and journalists are addressees. However, there still are\norganizations that do not publish their press releases online. Even in this case, though, it is becoming more and\nmore usual to address the press release to a public wider than journalists. For instance, some organizations, when\npromoting an event, send their press releases by e-mail not only to journalists, but also to a mailing-list of\npotentially interested people who are likely to assure the public of the event (we can mention i2a istituto\ninternazionale di architettura of Vico Morcote, Ticino, as an actual example we dealt with in the course of\ncomposition described in section 6). Also in this case, the addressees of the press release can be ascribed to\ndifferent categories.\n92 There exist two groups of addressees because the text is released on two different channels. In business\ncommunication, however, addressees often entail different categories, even when the text is released on a unique\nchannel. See as an example the analysis of the addressees of an institutional brochure described in section 6.\n448 by launching it on a communicative channel, he \u201cgives voice\u201d to the text.93 Equally, the\nanimator of the press release is the news portal on which it has been published and the\nanimator of the TV commercial is the TV channel which telecasts it.\nPeople to whom the text is not directly addressed but are entitled to take part into the\ncommunicative event do not come into play in the press release,94 whereas they can be\nidentified as participants of the TV commercial and of the brochure\u2019s rhetorical situation. In\nthe case of the TV commercial, children count as ratified participants because, on the one\nside, as TV viewers, they take part in the communicative event (they can see and hear the\nmessage; besides, they are mentioned in the message, both because the text points out that\nXylo Mepha is available in a specific dosage for children and because part of the visual stages\na girl playing in the snow with her mother and their dog), but, on the other side, they are not\ndirectly in a position to positively modify the principal\u2019s exigence. In the case of the brochure,\nratified participants are health professionals who look through the website for some\ninformation on health products and health professionals who subscribed to this website and\nreceived the brochure by mail; they wish to know the product and its advantages better. Again,\nsince the brochure is provided on chemists\u2019 counters, it is plausible to think of chemists\nthemselves as gatekeepers of the text: they must restock the counter with other brochures\nwhen all have been taken. No gatekeeper is identified in relation to the press release; in fact,\njournalists open and close gates not to press releases but rather to news and their content (cf.\n93 In Goffman\u2019s examples (which deal with oral discursive practices) the animator offers his voice to the text and\nactivates the text by reading it. Accordingly, in the case of written communication, the actual animation of the\ntext consists in its reading and therefore the recipient and the other receiving stakeholders play also the role of\nanimators. However, in order to be read, the text must be published, visible; the text has to reach its recipients.\nTherefore, in a sense, in the case of written communication, animators are also those who offer the channel and\nwho activate it on and through that channel, by publishing and printing it.\n94 However, there exist rhetorical situations of press releases in which this kind of participant is present. We can\nmention again as an example some press releases written by i2a for promoting their expositions. The press\nreleases present both the main artist of the exposition and other artists intervening in various exhibitions usually\nheld during vernissages and finissages. Since they are mentioned in the texts, the artists become ratified\nparticipants of the communicative event.\n449 note 4 above). Press releases always reach journalists as addressees, subsequently journalists\ncan decide whether to write an article on that news or not.95\nApart from rules regulating the compositional structure and style of press releases as\ndiscourse genres, no regulators in terms of stakeholders are recognized. Interestingly, the\nbrochure, the print ad and the TV commercial hint at national norms governing\nadvertisements for medical products. According to the Swiss Ordinance on Advertising for\nMedical Products only medical products without doctor\u2019s prescription can be advertised to the\ngeneral public. Ads must not be misleading and must not incite an inappropriate use of the\nproduct; in a print ad some indication like \u201cThis is a medicine. Read carefully the medical\ninstructions\u201d must be added, while at the end a TV commercial (which can be telecast only if\nit is approved by Swissmedic, the Swiss agency for authorisation and supervision of\ntheraupetic products) must state \u201cThis is a medicine. Ask your specialist for advice and read\nthe medical instructions\u201d.\nIn the rhetorical situations of these four texts no bystander can be identified. As we\nalready noticed, the fact that the TV commercial is telecast on a TV channel implies that\nevery TV viewer is an addressee or a ratified participant. Similarly, the fact that the press\nrelease is published on a public website implies that every Internet user is a ratified participant.\nThe same can be said for the brochure, which is downloadable from the Mepha website.\nHowever, even if we consider the other channel of distribution of the brochure (the chemist),\nno bystander emerges: when a person enters the chemist, s/he becomes a chemist\u2019s customer\nand, accordingly, s/he assumes the role of addressee. Similarly, when a person picks up the\nSunstore magazine at the chemists or takes it in her/his hand at home and browses through it,\ns/he becomes a Sunstore reader and therefore an addressee.\n95 Since more and more frequently organizations publish press releases online, the role of gatekeeper of the\njournalist is partially reduced (cf. Strobbe & Jacobs 2005).\n450 On the base of the analysis of these four examples, we can provide a more precise description\nof the stakeholders of promotional texts (table 2).\nTable 2 \u2013 Stakeholders of texts promoting Xylo Mepha\nExample from texts\nRole Description\npromoting Xylo Mepha\nAnimator Someone who materially writes a text The webmaster of\nby activating a writing technology. pressportal.ch who is asked to\nupload a press release on the\nwebsite.\nAuthor Someone who produces a text An assistant who is asked to\nformulating the content and choosing produce a brochure promoting\nexpressive strategies.

Educational application\nThe notion of stakeholders and the classification presented above have been introduced in a\nbachelor course of composition at the Faculty of Communication Sciences of the University\nof Lugano. Concretely, students were asked to write texts of organizational genres (such as\nletters, press releases, reports, proposals, brochures, leaflets, interviews) in order to face\nactual communication needs of actual (local) organizations (which agreed to play the role of\nprincipals). For instance, some students had to write press releases and the related email cover\nletters for the promotion of expositions by i2a, as well as leaflets and letters for the promotion\nof some of i2a laboratories for kids; other students were asked to produce a sponsoring\ndossier, a magazine and the corresponding email cover letter for promoting Lugano LongLake\nFestival, a summer event organized by the Youths and Events Department of Lugano; other\nstudents were asked to conceive a new and more effective format for the annual report of the\nFederation of the non-governmental organizations of Italian Switzerland (FOSIT), as well as a\nnew brochure for the institutional presentation of the federation and a press kit.\nBefore starting the writing of the committed texts, students were asked to\nidentify the text\u2019s stakeholders according to the above exposed classification and to\ndescribe stakeholders in terms of role, attitudes, needs, aspirations, desires,\n452 knowledge, goals, relationship to other stakeholders. The stakeholder\u2019s description\nmethod was inspired by the methods of audience analysis exposed by Schriver (1997:\n154-162), particularly by the classification-driven analysis and by the intuition-driven\nanalysis. The description encompassed the two main dimensions of communication\ncontext according to Rigotti and Rocci\u2019s (2006) model: the institutional dimension and\nthe interpersonal dimension.\nSuch a detailed description of stakeholders - and the in-depth understanding of\nthe rhetorical situation of texts it allows us to reach - can be a valuable tool for the\nteaching of composition and it provides students with a conceptual tool that sustains\nthem in achieving effectiveness in business functional communication. Starting from\nthe assumption that a text is effective when it achieves its goal, that is, when it\npositively modifies the exigence from which it stemmed, and considering that one of\nthe essential components of a text\u2019s effectiveness is its adequacy to the rhetorical\nsituation, a precise and concrete identification of the stakeholders of a text makes\nstudents aware of the very situated character of each text and helps them in producing\ntexts adherent and relevant to the exigence. For instance, a detailed description of the\nstakeholders of the institutional brochure for FOSIT shows that addressees belong to\ndifferent categories with different needs and imposing different requirements on the\ntext, which have an impact on the choice of the brochure contents. The addressees are\nItalian Swiss non-governmental organizations which are considering whether to join\nthe federation, actual and potential sponsors as well as the media and all the Italian\nSwiss population. It is important for them all to know that the federation exists and\nwhat it does, which are the affiliated NGOs and which projects are being carried out.\nHowever, this is not sufficient information either for potential sponsors (who may\nwant to know also how the federation is organized and managed and which is its\n453 actual financial situation) or for NGOs interested in becoming members of the\nfederation (which also want to know who can join it, how and when, and which\nadvantages this affiliation would have for them). Besides, the analysis of stakeholders\noutlines that affiliated NGOs are ratified participants of the brochure: they care that\nthe image of the federation and of themselves that emerges out of the text corresponds\nto the set of values that leads them and that convinced them to join FOSIT.\nIn fact, such a conceptual tool can be useful in order to shape and build into the text the\nimplied writer and the implied reader (Jameson 2004a, 2004b). As Jameson (2004a) points\nout, the implied writer and reader do not coincide with the live writer and reader, but they are\na \u201csubset of the whole, complex person\u201d (392). \u201cThe whole, live human being who writes is\nnever exactly the same as the writer\u2019s representation of self implied in the text\u201d (Jameson,\n2004b: 231). By becoming aware of the stakeholders of the texts and of the needs, exigencies\nand requirements of those stakeholders (which emerge in the stakeholders\u2019 description),\nstudents can be supported in eliciting the traits and aspects of concrete and real stakeholders\nthat has to be coped with in order to build into the text an adequate implied writer and an\nadequate implied reader. In this perspective, composition exercises such as the following one\ncan be developed: students are given the examples we have analyzed above as sources, that is,\ntexts from which they can retrieve some useful information about the organization and its\nproducts. After describing the rhetorical situation for each text and its stakeholders, students\nare asked to produce, for instance, a letter by a chemist asking to be sent more brochures and\nsome other promotional material together with more Xylo Mepha to sell (this letter will be\nsent together with the formal commercial order for more products). In such an exercise\nstudents will for instance realize that some participants in the communication event of the\nbrochure and of the letter they have to write are the same (Mepha Pharma, chemist), but they\nplay different roles, they are different stakeholders: in the communication event of the\n454 brochure Mepha Pharma is the principal (and maybe also the author) and the chemist is a\nratified participant as well as a gatekeeper, while in the communication event of the letter\nMepha Pharma is the addressee and the chemist is the principal (while students play the role\nof authors). The \u201csituatedness\u201d of each text will therefore emerge: even if the two texts refer\nroughly \u201cto the same thing\u201d, the communication event they realize is different. Besides by\ndescribing these two stakeholders and, for instance, their usual relationship, students discover\nhow to implement the characteristics of real stakeholders in the text, particularly in the\nimplied writer and reader. As to our example, for instance, is the relationship between Mepha\nPharma and the chemist a formal one or a confidential one? And is it usual for chemists to\nrequire additional brochures or not? Does it often happen that the number of brochures Mepha\nPharma thought to be sufficient is in fact insufficient? Accordingly, has the letter\u2019s implied\nwriter to be someone who is expressing a normal routine-based request to a colleague he is\nused to contacting for lots of big and small problems and questions or someone who is risking\nan unusual request to a corporation with which he usually does not interact?\n4. Conclusion\nIn this contribution we have attempted to answer the question \u2018who is communicating to\nwhom in promotional genres\u2019. Taking examples \u2013 a press release, a brochure, a print ad and a\nTV commercial promoting a nasal spray \u2013 from the marketing communication domain, we\nhave presented our rhetorical approach. Its application to texts belonging to different domains\nhas been only briefly described; a wider illustration would be possible (and will be the theme\nof future works), but it is out of the scope of the present paper, which aims at providing an\nillustrative example of the interest of the model of stakeholders of a text.\nThe fundamental concepts of our approach are those of rhetorical situation, genre and\nstakeholders.\n455 All the participants in a communicative event are stakeholders since they are interested\nin the success of the communication taking place. Communication arises for an exigence,\nwhich is a kernel element in every rhetorical situation. Texts are communicative events\narising within a specific context in order to adhere to this specific exigence. The context-\nbound goal is achieved using communicative tools known as discourse genres, which are\nshared flexible recipes for communication that stakeholders can interpret and produce\naccording to their goals. Texts such as the examples we have presented here show that texts\nwith similar goals \u2013 that of promoting a product \u2013 apply to different rhetorical situations\nwhere various stakeholders play specific roles.\nAdherence to rhetorical situations and stakeholders is crucial for the communicative success\nof texts in business communication. Therefore, we believe that this approach, especially the\nmodel of stakeholders, is a valuable tool not only for understanding a text but also for\nteaching how to produce effective texts in organizational and business realms.\nReferences\nAskehave, I. and J.

The basic functions of the headline are to inform the reader and attract his/her attention. In order to\nsuccessfully inform, the headline has to provide answers to one or more basic questions (who, what, where,\nwhen, why). The headline also has to attract the attention of the reader by the means of figurativeness which\narises not only from the positional prominence and the graphic features of the headline, but also as a result of\nspecific linguistic combination and arrangement of various parts of the message within the whole.\nThe paraphrase is a common figure in newspaper headlines. This term signifies a basic rhetorical\nprocess of statement development, as well as a macro-structural stylistic figure. With regard to discursive basis,\nwe differentiate between four types of paraphrase: linguistic, commentary, literary and ludic.\nThe purpose of this study was to identify the frequency of ludic paraphrases in daily (Slobodna\nDalmacija and Vjesnik) and weekly newspapers (Nacional and Globus) as well as to test the knowledge and\nunderstanding of modified phrases used in the headlines on two groups of selected examinees. The initial\nhypothesis about the differences in the usage of paraphrases between daily and weekly newspapers was\nconfirmed. The analysis of percentages of paraphrased headlines recognized by examinees revealed different\nlevels of understanding.\nKey words: journalistic discourse, figurativeness, newspaper headlines, paraphrase\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Headline, figurativeness, journalistic discourse\nNewspaper headlines are specific types of texts in which one or more words announce\nthe following article. The headline takes the central place in the text: it is graphically\nseparated from the text body and often classified in the group of small texts (phrases, proverbs,\ncatchwords, aphorisms, jokes, graffiti etc.) (Halliday, 1994: 392-397, in Ivas, 2004).\n459 The basic function of the headline is defined in its positional prominence, the purpose\nof which is to attract the reader\u2019s attention and inform the reader about the basic content of the\ntext body. The above mentioned functions represent the pragmatic and semantic roles of the\nheadline (Iarovici and Amel, 1989) and they form the basic requirements of the journalistic\nstyle. The semantic role is evident in the text body and the pragmatic role is evident in the\neffect it exerts on the reader. In order to successfully inform, the headline has to provide\nanswers to one or more basic questions (who, what, where, when, why). The headline also has\nto attract the attention of the reader through a figurativeness which arises not only from the\npositional prominence and the graphic features of the headlines, but also as a result of distinct\nlinguistic choice and specific arrangement of parts of the message within the whole (To\u0161ovi\u0107,\n2002; Sili\u0107, 2006).\nThe journalistic style is also known as the hybrid style (Pranji\u0107, 1968: 17) because it\nincludes features of other functional styles such as literary, scientific, administrative and\nconversational, according to the type of the newspaper text (news, report, paper, review,\ninterview, chronicle...) (To\u0161ovi\u0107 2002: 242, 250).\nThe headline strongly relies on figurativeness - it must adhere to principles of\nlanguage economy and transfer a meaningful message to another person. That message has to\narouse the interest of the reader (Veselica-Majhut 2006: 753). The construction of newspaper\nheadlines changes depending on the type of audience targeted, the historical context,\ngeneration, gender, age of the reader, etc. The pragmatic and semantic function of the\nheadline is to point to an extra-textual reality, thus other texts to which a headline also refers\nbecome an inter-textual junction or the reader\u2019s connection with the author of the text (Ivas\n2004: 14). The headline\u2019s compact format enables its function as a paraphrase.\nFigurativeness is very important in newspaper headlines. A figurative device is created\nthrough a special arrangement of language and it serves to fulfill most of the headline\u2019s\n460 functions (Ivas, 2004). Recognition of figurativeness reveals the reader\u2019s level of education\nand cultural awareness, as well as a capacity for abstract thinking. In addition, headlining is\nchallenging for the reporter because he/she has to keep in mind the audience addressed,\npresume their level of cultural experience and also successfully attract attention, entertain or\ndisturb the audience. Even when it is not clearly figurative, the headline takes on this function\nbecause of its positional prominence in regard to the addressed text. Figurative devices in the\nheadline additionally assert its independence from the text body. The headline or newspaper\narticle does not necessarily have to employ figurativeness: the frequency or lack of figurative\nlanguage use depends on the type of news and also on the journalist\u2019s style and skill. These\ncharacteristics generate differences between newspapers.\nThe most common type of figurative speech in a headline in addition to metaphor and\nmetonymy is paraphrase.\n1.2. Paraphrase - the history of the term\nThe term paraphrase derives from the Greek word par\u00e1phrasis meaning description,\nloose translation. It signifies the fundamental rhetorical process of statement development,\nand functions as a macro-structural stylistic figure. In both cases paraphrase refers to\nrewriting, retelling, reworking of a sentence or statement (Bagi\u0107, 2007).\nIn the 20th century the term paraphrase became obsolete in language and literature.\nAestheticians, literary theorists and linguists today often discuss paraphrase with negative\nconnotations, defining it as a simplification of serious discourse. A pejorative meaning can\nfrequently be found in everyday communication, as we think about paraphrase as chaotic,\nbulky and imprecise commentary (Bagi\u0107, 2007). Many linguists have adopted a broader\ndefinition of paraphrase. They define it as a restatement of a text in another form or in other\nwords, often to simplify or clarify meaning. For example Crystal (2003) says that it is a term\n461 used in linguistics for the result or process of producing alternative versions of a sentence or\ntext without changing the meaning. One sentence may have several paraphrases, e. g. The dog\nis eating a bone, A bone is being eaten by the dog, It's the dog who is eating a bone, and so on\n(Crystal, 2003: 336). Most semantic theories would treat all these sentences as having a single\nsemantic representation. Linguists use syntactic paraphrase as a major procedure for\nestablishing certain types of transformational relations (Crystal, 2003: 336).\nIn spite of the neglect of paraphrase in the 20th century, this has not always been the\ncase: in ancient Greece and Rome paraphrase was the most important exercise in the\neducation of orators, writers and intellectuals. Pupils were asked to reformulate or paraphrase\na text or a phrase. It was also recommended by the great rhetoricians Quintilian and\nHermogen. Quintilian described it as the best method for a basic understanding of the text.\nHowever, he warned against using a paraphrase as a literal translation of the original, but\nrather advised that it should compete with the original in expression of thought (Quintilian,\n1986). Ancient Romans recommended three types of periphrastic reformulation: (1) Latin\ntranslation of Greek orators, (2) prose paraphrase of Latin poetry and (3) rewriting their own\ntexts (Bagi\u0107, 2007). Therefore, Greeks and Romans defined paraphrase more as a process of\nstatement development than as a macro-structural stylistic figure.\nQuintilian\u2019s definition of paraphrase is also confirmed by some modern-day linguists:\n\u201ctelling, describing, formulating thoughts and names with different or clearer words\u201d (Ani\u0107,\n2006: 996); it could be said that paraphrase is \u201cmodifying the known phrase in a way that it\nremains recognizable but with a new meaning\u201d (\u0160kari\u0107, 2000: 127). Paraphrase can therefore\nappear: (1) as a fundamental rhetorical process of statement development and (2) also as a\nmacro-structural stylistic figure. In the first case the meaning of the original is preserved,\nwhile in the second case the original phrase is usually used as a suitable framework for\nsemantic changes (Bagi\u0107, 2007: 38). With regard to the discursive basis we differentiate\n462 between four types of paraphrase: linguistic, commentary, literary and ludic (Bagi\u0107, 2007).\nThis paper focuses on the fourth type of paraphrase. The term ludic paraphrase implies the\nintervention into structurally and semantically canonized statements such as proverbs, clich\u00e9s,\ncollocations, titles of books, titles of songs, titles of films, etc.\n2. Purpose and hypothesis\nBecause this research was divided in two parts, there are also several goals and\nhypotheses. In the first part of the research the goals were (1a) to determine the representation\nof paraphrase in daily and weekly newspapers\u2019 headlines and (1b) to determine the frequency\nin the use of paraphrase between daily and weekly newspapers. In the second part of the\nresearch the goal was (2) to analyze the reception of newspaper headlines between two\ndifferent groups of examinees.\nThe hypotheses were divided in two groups, those relating to representation and those\nrelating to reception. The hypotheses related to the representation were the following: (1a)\nthe analysis of the corpus will show certain differences in the usage of paraphrase in daily and\nweekly newspapers; (1b) more frequent usage of paraphrases is expected in weekly paper\nheadlines due to the dominance of a pragmatic over a semantic function of the headlines; (1c)\nthe daily newspaper Slobodna Dalmacija will contain more paraphrases than Vjesnik. These\ntwo daily papers target very different readerships, which is why there are certain differences\nin the structure of their headlines. Despite its low circulation, Vjesnik96 was among the best\ndaily papers on the market, singled out in its serious approach to journalism and professional\ntreatment of information97. However, this research will not focus on an analysis of the\n96 The daily newspaper Vjesnik stopped being published in 2012 after 72 years.\n97 This is the opinion held by many eminent Croatian experts such as judges of the Supreme court, directors of\ndifferent institutions, union leaders, and cultural and scientific staff.\nhttp://www.vjesnik.hr/Article.aspx?ID=221DA256-F05C-4D98-8585-5F349DCE7BBF).\n463 difference between these newspapers on the content level, but rather on the difference\nbetween quality and popular newspapers \u2013 a differentiation common in Anglophone societies\n(Veselica, Majhut, 2006: 455). Therefore, it is presumed that Slobodna Dalmacija, as a\npopular newspaper, will contain more inter-textual games (paraphrases) than a quality paper\nsuch as Vjesnik. Finally, (1d) the presumption is that, unlike the daily newspapers, weekly\npapers will contain equal frequency of paraphrasing.\nThe presumptions of the second part of the research were the following. (2a) There\nwill be certain differences between two groups of examinees in the reception of paraphrases.\nThe largest differences were expected for buzz words and phrases, which are limited just to\none generation or social group. Along with this basic assumption, additional differences in the\nreception of paraphrases in relation to gender, level of education and cultural awareness were\nexamined. (2b) It is expected that educated examinees, regardless of age and gender, will\nrecognize historical, mythological and literary paraphrases more frequently.\n3. Research methodology\nResearch was conducted in two parts. The representation of paraphrase in newspaper\nheadlines was examined in the first part. For this purpose headlines from Croatian daily\npapers (Slobodna Dalmacija and Vjesnik) and weekly newspapers (Nacional and Globus)\nwere collected and analyzed. Data were not collected systematically because the goal was not\nto compare the frequency of paraphrases in various papers during the same period. Thirty-one\n464 copies of each daily paper from August till December 2011, and thirty-one copies of each\nweekly paper from October 2009 till December 2011 were analyzed.\nIn the second part of research the reception of paraphrases within two groups of\nexaminees was analyzed. There were 80 examinees, 40 younger and 40 older ones.\nRespondents were given a questionnaire with 57 paraphrased headlines from the first part of\nthe research. In the first part of the questionnaire basic demographic data were collected (age,\ngender, level of education, profession). Also data about examinees\u2019 cultural awareness\n(reading books and magazines, going to the theatre, doing quizzes) were gathered. For the last\ntwo questions (general and cultural awareness) respondents were offered scaled answers: rare\n(less than 5), periodically (from 5 to 10), regularly (more than 10). In the second part of the\nquestionnaire, the respondents had to suggest the original form of the modified headline, eg.\nfor the proverb Through the mud to the stars98 / Preko blata do zvijezda99 they had to write\nThrough the thorns to the stars / Preko trnja do zvijezda. The authors of this paper wanted to\nascertain the recognition of the original form of the paraphrase which would enable readers to\nhave a better reception of the headlines.\nIn order to ascertain the degree of the recipients\u2019 recognition and understanding of\nparaphrases in headlines, the questionnaire was given to 80 examinees. The first group\nconsisted of 40 undergraduate and graduate students of Croatian Language and Literature at\nthe Faculty of Philosophy in Split and their average age was 22. The second group consisted\nof 40 examinees and their average age was 56. In the first group, most of the examinees\nenrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs after completing gymnasium high schools\n(78%). In the second group, examinees with completed high school education were\n98Per aspera ad astra or Ad astra per aspera is a Latin phrase which means any of the following: \"Through\nhardships to the stars\", \"A rough road leads to the stars\" or \"To the stars through difficulties\". The phrase is one\nof many Latin sayings which use the expression Ad astra.\n99Since the examples were collected from Croatian newspaper, they will be always presented both in Croatian\nand English. The meaning of the examples discussed or used for illustration will also be explained the first time\nthey appear.\n465 predominant (63%), while only 37% of examinees only completed a high school education.\nIn the first group the women to men ratio was 80:20% and in the second group it was 25:75%.\n4. Results and Discussion\n4.1. Representation of paraphrase in daily and weekly newspapers\nIn the overall corpus of nine thousand eight hundred sixty-six headlines fifty-seven\nheadlines with some paraphrastic conversion were found. In the headlines extracted from the\ncorpus, journalists arranged known lexical groups \u2013 phrases, movie titles, songs, books, lyrics,\nclassical proverbs - into new combinations. They modified them to produce an allusion, a\ngame between the original and its transformations.\nAs it has been expected, the analysis of the representation of paraphrases in daily and\nweekly papers revealed some differences. In the ratio of paraphrased and non-paraphrased\nheadlines the results are the following: in daily papers twenty paraphrases were extracted\nfrom the total number of seven thousand ninety-five headlines, which makes up \u201conly\u201d 0.28%\nof the corpus, while in weekly papers thirty-seven paraphrases were extracted from the total\nnumber of two thousand seven hundred seventy-one, which makes up 1.34% of the corpus.\nThis difference is also confirmed with the measure of frequency defined in the absolute\nnumber of paraphrased headlines.\n466 daily newspaper weekly newspaper\n35%\n65%\nFigure1 Percentage of paraphrases in daily and weekly newspapers\nIn daily papers twenty paraphrases were found, which amounts to 35% of the total\nnumber of selected headlines, while thirty-seven paraphrases were found in weekly papers,\nwhich amounts to 65% of the total number of selected headlines. The results (both in the ratio\nof paraphrased and non-paraphrased headlines and in the absolute number of paraphrased\nheadlines) confirmed the hypothesis that weekly papers contain more paraphrases than daily\npapers. The first reason lies in their requirements. The first requirement of daily newspapers\nSlobodna Dalmacija and Vjesnik is to inform the readers. In the headlines this could be\nexplained through the dominance of their semantic over pragmatic function and consequently\nthe reduced number of paraphrases. On the other hand, weekly newspapers form more casual\ndiscourse the function of which is to entertain the readers in addition to being of an\ninformative character.\nThe analysis revealed differences in representation of paraphrase not only in daily\npapers, but also in weekly papers. The measure of frequency in the ratio of paraphrased and\nnon-paraphrased headlines showed the following results: twelve paraphrased headlines out of\na total number of four thousand one hundred eighty-four headlines were found in Slobodna\nDalmacija, which makes up 0.29% of the corpus and eight paraphrased headlines out of two\n467 thousand nine hundred and eleven headlines were found in Vjesnik, which makes up 0.27% of\nthe corpus. Furthermore, twenty-eight paraphrased headlines out of one thousand one hundred\nforty-seven headlines were found in weekly paper Nacional (2.4%), and only nine\nparaphrased headlines out of total number of one thousand six hundred twenty-four headlines\nwere found in Globus (0.55%).\nThese results are also confirmed by the measure of frequency defined in the absolute\nnumber of paraphrased headlines. Twelve out of twenty paraphrases in daily papers were\nfound in Slobodna Dalmacija (60%), and eight paraphrases were found in Vjesnik (40%),\nwhich confirms our previous hypothesis about the difference in addressing readership\nbetween popular and quality newspapers. A greater difference was found in the usage of\nparaphrase in each weekly newspaper. Twenty-eight out of thirty-seven paraphrases in weekly\npapers were found in Nacional (76%), and nine paraphrases were found in Globus (24%).\nThese relations are presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3.\nSLOBODNA DALMACIJA VJESNIK NACIONAL GLOBUS\n24%\n40%\n60% 76%\n468 Figure 2.

Reception or recognition of paraphrase in daily and weekly newspapers\nIn the second part of the research, slight differences in the understanding of modified\nphrases were revealed between the two groups of examinees. The results represented show\ndifferences between examinees only on the basis of their age not on their level of education or\ncultural awareness. The older examinees have 45.8% correct answers in relation to attempting\nto answer 68% of the time, while younger examinees have 49.8% of correct answers in\nrelation to attempting to answer 62% of the time.

The questionnaires revealed that 23% of the student\npopulation regularly follows cultural events,100 and that 57% of them do so occasionally. This\nwas not the case with the older population, because they attend cultural events to a much\nlesser degree (or perhaps they were simply more sincere in their answers). Only 7.5% of older\nexaminees are regular readers and 58% are occasional readers. The results concerning global\nawareness101 of the examinees are somewhat different: both groups of examinees are equally\nwell informed by the media (48%).\nTherefore, there were obviously significant individual differences in the degree of\nrecognition of the paraphrased original. Just attempting to reconstruct the model informed us\nof the examinee\u2019s ability to recognize the origin of the paraphrased headline: the number of\nrecognized sources of headline paraphrases ranged from 26% to 88%.\n4.2.1. Different degrees of reception of headlines by younger examinees\nYounger examinees showed different stages of recognition of headlines from the\ncorpus. According to the percentage of successful original form reconstruction, results can be\ndivided in four groups:\nA. Maximum degree of recognition in which 75-100% of examinees recognized a group of 15\nparaphrases. This is 26% of the corpus. Here are some examples.102 The Dalmatian folk song\ntitle \u0160ime is back / Vratija se \u0160ime is recognized by 100% of examinees in the headline Drago\nis back / Vratija se Drago. The famous movie title Lassie come home / Lassie se vra\u0107a ku\u0107i\n100 Cultural events include visiting theatre, cinema, museums and so on.\n101 General awareness refers to internet usage, reading a newspaper, listening to the radio, watching television\u2026\n102 All examples are in Appendix 1.\n470 was recognized by 98% of examinees in the headline Kobe Bryant come home / Kobe Bryant\nse vra\u0107a ku\u0107i. The old proverbs Pay so you can mock / Plati pa se rugaj and Through the\nthorns to the stars / Preko trnja do zvijezda are recognized by 90% of the examinees in the\nheadlines Pay so you can swim / Plati pa se kupaj and Through the mud to the stars / Kroz\nblato do zvijezda. 75% of examinees knew that the headline Spices against humanity / Za\u010dini\nprotiv \u010dovje\u010dnosti comes from the phrase Crimes against Humanity / Zlo\u010dini protiv\n\u010dovje\u010dnosti.\nB. Second degree of recognition in which 50-74% of examinees recognized a group of 16\nparaphrases which makes up 28% of the corpus. For example103, examinees recognized the\nmovie title Lost in translation / Izgubljeni u prijevodu in the headline Lost in the institution /\nIzgubljeni u zavodu (73%) and the Czech movie My Sweet Little Village / Selo moje malo in\nthe headline My sweet nuclear village / Selo moje nuklearno (63%). \u201cOnly\u201d 58% of\nexaminees recognized Croatian National Tourist Board / Hrvatska turisti\u010dka zajednica in the\nphrase Croatian National Tourist Deception / Hrvatska turisti\u010dka obmana. The Latin phrase\nMan is wolf to another man104 / \u010covjek je \u010dovjeku vuk is identified by 55% of the examinees\nin the headline Croat is a Serb to another Croat / Hrvat je Hrvatu Srbin.\nC. Third degree of recognition in which 25-49% of examinees recognized a group of 12\nparaphrases, which is 21% of the corpus. E.g. in the headline Mulder without Scully / Mulder\nbez Scully, 43% of examinees recognized the characters Mulder and Scully from TV series\nThe X-Files. One of the most famous rallying cries of communism Workers of the world,\nunite! / Proleteri svih zemalja, ujedinite se! was identified by 33% of the respondents in the\nexclamation Croatists and Slavists, unite! / Kroatisti i slavisti, ujedinite se! The James Bond\nmovie From Russia with love / Iz Rusije s ljubavlju was also identified by 33% of the\nexaminees in the headline To Russia with love / Rusiji s ljubavlju.\n103 For other examples see Appendix 1.\n104 Homo homini lupus est is a Latin phrase meaning \u201dman is wolf to (his fellow man).\u201d First attested in Plautis\u2019\nAsinaria.\n471 D. Minimum degree of recognition in which 0-24% of examinees recognized a group of 14\nparaphrases which makes up 25% of the corpus. For example, the TV commercial slogan for\nthe Croatian National Tourist Board The Mediterranean as it once was / Mediteran kakav je\nnekad bio was recognized by only 15% of the examinees in the headline Istria as it once was /\nIstra kakva je nekad bila. No one recognized the movie title Closely watched trains105 /\nStrogo kontrolirani vlakovi in the headline Closely watched bulls of arts / Strogo kontrolirani\nbikovi umjetnosti.\nThe younger examinees who were unable to identify the original phrase stated their\nown modification of headlines or they connected them to a similar one. We will quote several\nexamples. The headline was Sanader106 stole my Christmas / Sanader mi je ukrao Bo\u017ei\u0107.\nExaminees recognized the movie How the Grinch Stole Christmas107/ Kako je Grin\u010d ukrao\nBo\u017ei\u0107 but mostly suggested a modified version of it - The Grinch Stole my Christmas / Grin\u010d\nje ukrao moj Bo\u017ei\u0107. The second example is the headline Grandma and her Credits are Gone /\nPro\u0161la baba s kreditima, which the examinees identified as Grandma and her\ncandies/cookies/eggs are gone / Pro\u0161la baba s bombonima/kola\u010dima/jajima. The original\nphrase is Grandma and her cookies are gone108 / Pro\u0161la baba s kola\u010dima.\n4.2.2. Different degrees of reception of newspaper headlines by older examinees\nOlder examinees also showed different degrees of the recognition of headlines. The\ncorpus can be divided into several groups according to the percentage of successful original\nform reconstruction.\nA. Maximum degree of recognition in which 75-100% of examinees recognized a group\nof 11 paraphrases, which makes up 19% of the corpus.\n105A Czech movie from 1966. Director Jiri Menzel was the recipient of the Academy Award for Best Foreign\nLanguage Film that year.\n106 Ivo Sanader, former Croatian Prime Minister, now under investigation for embezzlement.\n107 It is a children's story by Dr. Seuss, adapted as an animated special in 1966.\n108 Croatian proverb meaning \u201csomebody missed his chance\u201c, \u201cwhen it's over it's over\u201c.\n472 B. Second degree of recognition in which 50-74% of examinees recognized a group of 15\nparaphrases which makes up 26% of the corpus.\nC. Third degree of recognition in which 25-49% of examinees recognized a group of 11\nparaphrases which makes up 19% of the corpus.\nD. Minimum degree of recognition in which 0-24% of examinees recognized a group of\n14 paraphrases which makes up 25% of the corpus109.\nSome individuals from the older group of examinees who were also unable to identify\nthe original form of a paraphrase developed their own modifications. For example the\nheadline was Through the mud to the stars / Preko blata do zvijezda and the examinees\nidentified it as Through the mud to freedom / Preko blata do slobode instead of the proverb\nThrough the thorns to the stars / Preko trnja do zvijezda. Another interesting modification\nwas for the headline In search of lost innocence / U potrazi za izgubljenom nevino\u0161\u0107u.\nExaminees stated the phrase In search of a lost suitcase / U potrazi za izgubljenim kov\u010degom\ninstead of the original book title In Search of lost time110/ U potrazi za izgubljenim vremenom.\nFor many examples the examinees had broader associations, e.g. the headline The curse of\nPrime Minister Sanader / Sanaderova kletva which is a paraphrased old Croatian curse The\ncurse of King Zvonimir111 / Zvonimirova kletva. However, the examinees identified the\nheadline as Remetinec112 or Whoever digs a pit (for another man's feet) shall fall into it\nhimself. / Tko pod drugim jamu kopa113 or To have and have not114 / Dabogda, imao pa\nnemao.\nIt has already been said that two groups of examinees can hardly be differentiated on\nthe bases of overall results in the understanding of paraphrases. Therefore, our previous\n109 Complete list of paraphrases see in Appendix 2.\n110 A novel by Marcel Proust.\n111 900 hundred year-old Croatian legend. The legend says that King Dmitar Zvonimir cursed Croats after they\nkilled him such that they would never again have a ruler of their own blood.\n112 The Croatian jail where the ex-Prime Minister was imprisoned.\n113 Old Croatian proverb.\n114 Old Croatian folk proverb.\n473 hypothesis based on the assumption that age and different cultural backgrounds have no\ninfluence on paraphrase recognition should be discarded. For example, the younger and older\ngroups of examinees displayed very different, and occasionally significantly opposite, levels\nof knowledge and paraphrase recognition, especially when asked to identify movie and song\ntitles. The degree of the examinees\u2019 familiarity with the modified headline depends on several\ncircumstances. It is known that phraseological in general and paraphrastic groups in particular\nare very dynamic and many paraphrases are short-lived and are quickly replaced by new ones.\nThe headlines that were most frequently recognized by examinees were modifications of\ncommon proverbs, pragmatic formulas, fairytale titles, commercials, famous movies,\ncollocation and so on. The headlines that were less frequently identified are actually\nunmodified titles of old movies which the younger generations were unfamiliar with, titles of\nold songs, ancient phrases, international phrases, proverbs\u2026 The following examples show\nthe great level of difference between the two groups of examinees in recognizing paraphrase\noriginals: 98% of the older examinees recognized the title of the song Blue eyes shed tears115 /\nSuze liju plave o\u010di in the form Suze Lyon plave o\u010di, while the younger examinees recognized\nit only 50% of the time; the paraphrase Tower neither in socialism nor in capitalism / \u010cardak\nni u socijalizmu ni u kapitalizm was identified by 95% of the older examinees as the Serbian\nfolk tale Tower neither in heaven nor on earth / \u010cardak ni na nebu ni na zemlji. Nowadays,\ndue to the fact this story is no longer a part of the school curriculum, its recognition was\nsignificantly lower among the younger examinees, meaning only 25%. A similar result is also\nfound in the socialist slogan Proletarians of all countries, unite! / Proleteri svih zemalja,\nujedinite se! The older examinees recognize it from the paraphrase Kroatisti i slavisti,\nujedinite se! / Croatists and slavists, unite! 58% of the time, while the younger examinees\nonly 33%.\n115 Song by Croatian songwriter and singer Ivica \u0160erfezi from 1966.\n474 There is one example where the results of recognition are higher in the younger\nexaminee group: the title of the movie Pirates of the Caribbean / Pirati s Kariba which\nappears in the form Pirates of the river Danube / Pirati s Dunava was recognized by as many\nas 95% of the younger examinees, and by only 70% of the older examinees. Another\ninteresting example is the paraphrase Lost in the institute / Izgubljeni u zavodu. The younger\nexaminees identified it mostly as Lost in translation / Izgubljeni u prijevodu and the older\nexaminees identified it as the proverb Lost in time/space/universe / Izgubljeni u\nvremenu/prostoru/svemiru.\n5. Conclusion\nThe usage of paraphrases in headlines is a very efficient way of drawing the reader\u2019s\nattention to the content of an article. In addition to hinting at the theme of the article,\nheadlines encourage the reader to be an active participant in the interpretation of the text.\nManipulation of phraseological meaning usually provokes surprise, humor or irony in readers\nand that is why headlines are strong stylistic tools.\nThe purpose of this study was to verify the frequency of ludic paraphrases in daily\n(Slobodna Dalmacija and Vjesnik) and weekly newspapers (Nacional and Globus) as well as\nto verify the knowledge and understanding of modified phrases used in headlines.\nThe research has confirmed the authors\u2019 presumption that paraphrases appear more\nfrequently in weekly than in daily newspapers because of specific rules in discourse formation\nrelated to the style of a certain author and a weekly or daily newspaper. Daily newspapers are\nfocused on informing the reader about everyday events, and in addition weekly newspapers\nhave entertainment features as well, manifested in the use of figurative headlines. In general,\nserious sections and subjects covered in Croatian newspapers automatically exclude the\n475 possibility of the use of intentional paraphrase. However, the use of paraphrase does not have\nto undermine the seriousness of the subject. On the contrary, it could reveal the journalist\u2019s\nenormous creativity.\nAs it was assumed, there are certain differences between the two daily and two weekly\npapers. The higher frequency of paraphrases in the headlines in Slobodna Dalmacija should\nbe observed in the broader context of the existing differences between popular and quality\nnewspapers that are addressing different audiences. Unexpected differences appeared in the\nstructure of headlines in the political weekly newspapers Globus and Nacional. The higher\nfrequency of paraphrases in Nacional could be explained by different ways of addressing the\nsame audience.\nIt is clear from the research that journalists use all kinds of established groups of\nwords (phrases, movie titles, book titles, verses, classical proverbs) which they modify to\ncreate allusions, games between the speaker and his/her transformation.\nThe research also showed that there is only a slight difference in paraphrase reception\nbetween young and older examinees. The same could be said for the relevance of\nasymmetrical cultural backgrounds, culturedness and the education of the journalists and\nreaders as well. As was already presumed, a difference in reception between two generations\narose from different social circumstances and asymmetrical knowledge.\nIn conclusion, the results of the reception of modified phrases showed that the\nexaminees displayed different degrees of understanding.\nThe number of modified phrases and diversities in readers\u2019 associations are instructive\nnot only for linguists who describe and theoretically interpret them but also for the journalists\nwho produce them.\nReferences\n476 Ani\u0107, V.
